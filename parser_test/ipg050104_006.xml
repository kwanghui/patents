<heading id="heading-d0e580" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The invention relates to a hydraulic control circuit for a boom cylinder in work machine, such as a hydraulic excavator, that is used in various types of construction and civil engineering works.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Generally, in some construction and civil engineering machinery, such as a hydraulic excavator, there is a type in which a front attachment mounted on the machinery body is composed of a boom whose base end portion is supported so as to swing upward and downward, an arm that is supported at the tip end portion of the boom so as to swing forward and backward, and a work attachment, such as a bucket attached to the tip end portion of the arm. In such a type, the above-described boom moves upward and downward in line with extension and contraction of a boom cylinder, wherein, conventionally, a hydraulic control circuit, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, has been known as a hydraulic control circuit for the boom cylinder.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, reference number <b>8</b> denotes a boom cylinder. Reference numbers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> denote the first and second pressurized oil supply sources. Reference number <b>13</b> denotes an oil reservoir. Reference number <b>14</b> denotes the first boom control valve for controlling the supply of pressurized oil to the boom cylinder <b>8</b> and discharge of pressurized oil therefrom, in which the first pressurized oil supply source is used as its pressurized oil supply source <b>11</b>. Reference number <b>15</b> denotes the second boom control valve for controlling the supply of pressurized oil to the boom cylinder <b>8</b>, in which the second pressurized oil supply source <b>12</b> is used as its pressurized oil supply source. Reference numbers <b>16</b> through <b>18</b> denote control valves for other hydraulic actuators, such as an arm cylinder and a bucket cylinder, attached to the hydraulic excavator. Reference number <b>19</b> denotes a pilot valve for outputting pilot pressure to the elevation side and descent side pilot lines C, D on the basis of operations of a boom operating lever <b>20</b>. In addition, reference letter A denotes the head side line for connecting the first boom control valve <b>14</b> and the second boom control valve <b>15</b> respectively to the head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the boom cylinder <b>8</b>. Reference letter B denotes the rod side line for connecting the first boom control valve <b>14</b> to the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the boom cylinder. Also, reference letter G denotes a recycling line for communicating the above-described head side line A and rod side line B with each other. In the recycling line G, a recycling valve <b>30</b> having a check valve <b>30</b><i>a </i>is provided.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">In this structure, when the boom operating lever <b>20</b> is operated to the elevation side, the first and second boom control valves <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are changed to the elevation side position X by pilot pressure outputted from the pilot valve <b>19</b> to the elevation side pilot line C, wherein pressurized oil from both the first and second pressurized oil supply sources <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> is supplied into the head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the boom cylinder <b>8</b>, and it is possible to efficiently carry out an upward motion (elevation) of the boom <b>5</b> against the weight of a front attachment.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">On the other hand, when the boom operating lever <b>20</b> is operated to the descending side, the first boom control valve <b>14</b> is changed to the descending side position Y by pilot pressure outputted from the pilot valve <b>19</b> to the descending side pilot line D, and at the same time, the recycling valve <b>30</b> is changed to the second position Y where the recycling line G is opened, wherein, while the pressurized oil from the first pressurized oil supply source <b>11</b> is supplied into the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the boom cylinder <b>8</b> via the first boom control valve <b>14</b>, the oil discharged from the head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a </i>is discharged into the oil reservoir <b>13</b> via the first boom control valve <b>14</b> and, at the same time, is further supplied into the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b </i>via the recycling valve <b>30</b>. That is, when the boom descends, while the pressure of the head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a </i>is higher than that of the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b</i>, the oil discharged from the head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a </i>may be supplied into the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b </i>as the recycling oil, wherein the recycling oil is supplied into the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b </i>in addition to the pressurized oil of the first pressurized oil supply source <b>11</b>, which is supplied from the above-described first boom control valve <b>14</b>, and accordingly the operation speed of the boom cylinder <b>8</b> can be made fast with the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b </i>not placed in a pressure-reduced state. Also, because a surplus pump oil flow obtained by recycling can be supplied into other hydraulic actuators when a combined operation including operation of the other hydraulic actuators (for example, an arm cylinder and a bucket cylinder), for which the pressurized oil supply source for the boom cylinder <b>8</b> is concurrently used, and descent of the boom is carried out, it is possible to prevent the operation speed of the other hydraulic actuators from being lowered in a combined operation. Therefore, the structure contributes to an improvement in the work efficiency.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">However, where the above-described boom is caused to descend to carry out surface compaction work and scraping work of an inclined plane by descent of the boom, because a force against the descent of the boom operates, it is necessary to supply highly pressurized oil into the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b</i>. To the contrary, where the boom is caused to descend in the air (that is, where the boom descends with the front attachment not grounded), as the weight applied to the boom (that is, the total weight of the front attachment) operates as a force for contraction of the boom, pressurized oil that is supplied into the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b </i>may be of low pressure. Further, because the head side area of the piston of the boom cylinder is larger than the rod side area, only the recycling oil from the above-described head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a </i>may be sufficient.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Therefore, in the above-described prior art hydraulic circuit, even if the boom is caused to descend in the air, not only the recycling oil but also pressurized oil from the first pressurized oil supply source are supplied via the first boom control valve <b>14</b>. Accordingly, where the arm and bucket are operated while causing the boom to descend in the air, the pressurized oil from the first pressurized oil supply source <b>11</b> is shared by the boom cylinder, arm cylinder and bucket cylinder, wherein motions of the arm and bucket become slow in comparison with independent operations thereof, and there is a problem in that work efficiency is worsened. Further, in the case of causing the boom to independently descend in the air, because pressurized oil from the first pressurized oil supply source is supplied into the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b </i>in spite of only the recycling oil from the head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a </i>being sufficient, a considerable amount of surplus oil of the oil discharged from the head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a </i>is discharged into the oil reservoir <b>13</b> via the first boom control valve <b>14</b>, wherein there is another problem in that energy loss is brought about, which may hinder improvement in fuel efficiency. These are objects to be solved by the invention.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">In addition, in a work machine provided with a front attachment consisting of the above-described boom, arm and work attachment, etc., for example, wherein debris rake-up work is carried out with the bottom of the bucket grounded while moving the boom forward and backward, although three operations of the boom, arm and bucket are obliged to be carried out at the same time for the boom to depict a roughly horizontal locus, the operations are delicate, and skilled operations are required. In addition, where the ground is hardened by continuously repeated operations of descent and elevation of the boom, that is, bumping work is carried out, unless the boom elevation operation is carried out at the instant when the bucket bottom is grounded, the ground is excessively bumped by a reaction caused by the descent of the boom, or the front part of a machine body is raised. Therefore, in order to continuously carry out bumping, a considerably skilled operation is required. Work requiring such skill is difficult for a beginner, and even a skilled operator is obliged to pay meticulous attention to the work. Accordingly, another problem to be solved exists in that, in such situations, the operationality and work efficiency are made worse.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1105" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">In view of the above-described situations, the invention was developed to solve these and other problems. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a hydraulic control circuit for a boom cylinder, comprising a boom cylinder that causes the boom to extend and contract in order to move the boom upward and downward; a first control valve that is freely changed to an operation position that controls supply of pressurized oil to respective oil chambers at the head side and the rod side of the boom cylinder and discharge thereof on the basis of operations of an operating member with the first pressurized oil supply source used as a pressurized supply source and to a neutral position where no pressurized oil is supplied thereinto and discharged therefrom; and a second control valve that controls supply of pressurized oil to a weight-holding side oil chamber of the respective oil chambers of the boom cylinder, which holds the weight of the boom, with a second pressurized oil supply source used as another pressurized oil supply source, wherein the corresponding hydraulic control circuit is provided with neutral holding means capable of holding the first control valve in the neutral position regardless of any operation of the operating member and a communication line for causing the head side oil chamber and rod side oil chamber of the boom cylinder to communicate with each other, the corresponding communication line is provided with opening and closing valve means for opening and closing the communication line, and direction valve means that is freely changed to an unidirectional state where, while an oil flow from the weight-holding side oil chamber of the boom cylinder to the other oil chamber is permitted, a reverse oil flow is hindered, and to a bidirectional state where oil flows in both directions, and the above-described second control valve is provided with discharge means for flowing surplus oil of the oil, which is discharged from the weight-holding side oil chamber of the boom cylinder and supplied into the other oil chamber, into an oil reservoir when the first control valve is held in the neutral position by the neutral holding means.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">With such a structure provided, by holding the first control valve in the neutral position in response to work content to be carried out by the boom and opening and closing the communication line in the unidirectional state and bi-directional state, the structure contributes to improvement in fuel efficiency, and at the same time, work efficiency can be improved in combination work with other hydraulic actuators for which the pressurized oil supply source of the boom cylinder is concurrently used, or work efficiency and operationality can be improved with respect to work, such as debris raking-up work or bumping work, for which boom operations are difficult. Furthermore, when the first control valve is held in the neutral position, oil discharge from the weight-holding side oil chamber to the oil reservoir is carried out by using the second control valve to supply pressurized oil of the second pressurized oil supply source into the weight-holding side oil chamber. Therefore, it is not necessary to separately provide an exclusive discharge valve and an exclusive discharge line, and this contributes to cost savings.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">In such a structure, if the hydraulic control circuit is structured so that the neutral holding means operates so as to hold the first control valve in the neutral position, where pressure detecting means to detect the pressure of the other oil chamber is provided, and the pressure of the other oil chamber, which is detected by the pressure detecting means is lower than or equal to a predetermined pressure, the neutral holding means operates to hold the first control valve at the neutral position in the case where, for example, the boom moves downward in the air, in response to a downward motion of the boom, which is recognized by the pressure of the other oil chamber.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">Further, the above-described neutral holding means comprises, for example, valve means capable of interrupting the pilot pressure outputted to change the first control valve to its operation position on the basis of operation of the operating member.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Also, the valve means comprising the above-described neutral holding means is structured, while output of pilot pressure is interrupted to the first control valve, so that the valve means for holding the first control valve in the neutral position outputs the corresponding pilot pressure to the second control valve and changes the second control valve to the operation state of the discharge means. Therefore, because it becomes possible for the second control valve to be changed to the operation state of the discharge means, concurrent use of members can be achieved, resulting in production cost savings.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">Still further, where pressure detecting means for detecting the pressure of the other oil chamber is provided, and the pressure of the other oil chamber, which is detected by the corresponding pressure detecting means, exceeds the set pressure established in advance, if the direction valve means is set so that the unidirectional state cannot be changed to the bi-directional state. Thereby, for example, where the front part of the machine body is raised by a descending force of the boom, such an inconvenience, by which the communication line is improperly changed to the bi-directional state, can be prevented from occurring.</p>

That is, the basic structure is the same as that of the related art hydraulic excavator.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a hydraulic control circuit for the above-described boom cylinder <b>8</b>.

Reference numbers <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> denote the first and second arm control valves. Reference number <b>18</b> denotes a bucket control valve. The first arm control valve <b>16</b>, the bucket control valve <b>18</b> and the first boom control valve <b>14</b> are connected to each other in juxtaposition with the first pressurized oil supply source <b>11</b> used as their pressurized oil supply source. In addition, the second arm control valve <b>17</b> and the second boom control valve <b>15</b> are connected to each other in juxtaposition with the second pressurized oil supply source <b>12</b> used as their pressurized oil supply source. Herein, there are other control valves that are connected in juxtaposition with respect to the above-described control valves <b>14</b> through <b>18</b>, corresponding to various types of hydraulic actuators provided in the hydraulic excavator <b>1</b>. However, these control valves are omitted in FIG. <b>2</b>.

Also, after the pressure of the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b </i>becomes higher than the pressure of the head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a</i>, pressurized oil from the first pressurized oil supply source <b>11</b> is supplied therein although the supply of the recycling oil is blocked by the pilot operating check valve <b>23</b>, wherein it is possible to carry out a descending motion of the boom <b>5</b> in a state where a force against the descent operates.</p>
<p id="P-00060" num="00060">Further, where debris rake-up work or bumping work is carried out with the bottom of the bucket <b>7</b> grounded, when the operation switch <b>27</b> is turned on and the boom operating lever <b>20</b> is operated to the boom descending side, the first boom control valve <b>14</b> is held in the neutral position N, and the second boom control valve <b>15</b> is changed to the descending side position Y. At the same time, the head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the boom cylinder <b>8</b> is caused to communicate with the rod side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>b </i>via the communication line E. And, for example, where debris rake-up work is carried out, if an arm drawing operation (extension of the arm cylinder <b>9</b>) and a bucket opening operation (contraction of the bucket cylinder <b>10</b>) are carried out with the boom operating lever <b>20</b> operated to the descending side (the amount of operation may be sufficient), the boom <b>5</b> is automatically elevated due to a reaction force from the ground while the boom <b>5</b> is automatically caused to descend by the weight of the front attachment <b>4</b>, wherein it is possible to cause the bucket <b>7</b> to move along the ground surface without delicate operation of the boom <b>5</b>, and work efficiency and operationality can be improved. In addition, where bumping work is carried out, if the boom operating lever <b>20</b> is operated to the descending side, the boom <b>5</b> descends due to the weight of the front attachment <b>4</b> until the bucket <b>7</b> is grounded, and the boom stops when the bucket <b>7</b> is grounded to regulate further descending motion. Therefore, even if the timing of raising the boom <b>5</b> is out of alignment, it is possible to eliminate an inconvenience by which the machine is raised by a reaction force caused when causing the boom <b>5</b> to descend, wherein work efficiency and operationality can be further improved.</p>
<p id="P-00061" num="00061">Herein, as described above, where the pressure P of the rod side line B, which is detected by the first pressure sensor <b>28</b>, is greater than the predetermined pressure Pd (that is, P&#x3e;Pd), the pilot operating check valve <b>23</b> is set, so that it is not placed into a bi-directional state, even if the operation switch <b>27</b> is turned on. For example, when an operator erroneously turns on the operation switch <b>27</b> and operates to descend the boom to further raise the machinery body in a state where the front part of the machinery body is raised by grounding the bucket <b>7</b> by causing the boom to descend, pressing the ground and lifting the front part of the machinery body (in this state, where the pressure of the rod side line B is greater than the predetermined pressure Pd (P&#x3e;Pd)) and if the pilot operating check valve <b>23</b> is in a bi-directional state, oil in the rod side line B will flow into the head side line A via the pilot operating check valve <b>23</b> located in a bi-directional state and, as a result of extension of the boom cylinder <b>8</b>, the front part of the machinery body will fall to the ground. Then, the above-mentioned setting of the pilot operating check valve <b>23</b> prevents oil in the rod side line B from flowing into the head side line A resulting in the extension of the boom cylinder <b>8</b>, and then prevents the front part of the machinery body from falling to the ground.</p>
<p id="P-00062" num="00062">In this connection, it becomes possible to carry out a descending motion of the boom <b>5</b>, which is suitable for respective work, on the basis of the changeover of ON and OFF of the operation switch <b>27</b> and the detection of the pressure of the rod side line B. Further, with this type of circuit, although oil discharge from the head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a </i>into the oil reservoir <b>13</b> is carried out by using the second boom control valve <b>15</b> when causing the boom <b>5</b> to descend with the first boom control valve <b>14</b> located in the neutral position N, when causing the boom <b>5</b> to elevate, the second boom control valve <b>15</b> is necessary in a general circuit in order to supply pressurized oil into the head side oil chamber <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the boom cylinder, and the type circuit is structured so that oil discharge is carried out by using the second boom control valve <b>15</b>. Therefore, because it is not necessary to provide an exclusive discharge valve and an exclusive discharge line, the production costs are reduced.</p>
<p id="P-00063" num="00063">In summary, the hydraulic control circuit for a boom cylinder according to the invention has a first control valve that is freely changed to an operation position that controls the supply of pressurized oil to the boom cylinder and the discharge thereof on the basis of operations of an operating member with the first pressurized oil supply source used as a pressurized supply source and to a neutral position where no pressurized oil is supplied thereinto and discharged therefrom; and the second control valve that controls supply of pressurized oil to the weight-holding side oil chamber of the boom cylinder, with a second pressurized oil supply source used as another pressurized oil supply source, wherein the corresponding hydraulic control circuit is provided with neutral holding means capable of holding the first control valve at the neutral position regardless of any operation of the operating member and a communication line for causing both of the oil chambers of the boom cylinder to communicate with each other, the corresponding communication line is provided with opening and closing valve means for opening and closing the communication line, and a direction valve means that is freely changed to an unidirectional state where, while an oil flow from the weight-holding side oil chamber of the boom cylinder to the other oil chamber is permitted, a reverse oil flow is hindered, and a bi-directional state is permitted where oil flows in both directions; and the above-described second control valve is provided with discharge means for flowing surplus oil, which is discharged from the weight-holding side oil chamber of the boom cylinder and supplied into the other oil chamber, into an oil reservoir when the first control valve is held in the neutral position by the neutral holding means. As a result, because the first control valve is held in the neutral position, and the communication line is opened or closed in an unidirectional or bi-directional state, this contributes to improvement in fuel efficiency. At the same time, it is possible to improve work efficiency in combination work or to improve work efficiency and operationality in work requiring difficult operation of the boom, such as debris rake-up work and bumping work. Still further, as oil can be discharged from the weight-holding side oil chamber with the first control valve held in the neutral position by using the second control valve, it is not necessary to additionally provide an exclusive discharge valve and an exclusive discharge line, whereby production costs can be further reduced.</p>
<p id="P-00064" num="00064">The invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment. Not only are the arm cylinder and bucket cylinder acceptable but also a hydraulic actuator, such as a traveling motor, swivel motor, etc., may be acceptable as the hydraulic actuator whose pressurized oil supply source is concurrently used for the boom cylinder. In the cases of such hydraulic actuators, an operation speed interlocked with the descent of the boom in the air can be made faster. In addition, a connection between a control valve for the hydraulic actuators and a control valve for boom control may be in series or parallel, and in either case, similar effects can be achieved.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">A control system for a work machine having a hydraulic actuator is provided. An input device generates a movement signal to control the movement of the hydraulic actuator. A sensor senses a parameter indicative of a magnitude of a force exerted by the hydraulic actuator.

<p id="P-00002" num="00002">This disclosure relates generally to a control system for a work machine and, more particularly, to a system and method for providing tactile feedback to an operator of a remotely controlled work machine.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e824" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">Work machines, such as, for example, wheel loaders, front shovels, track loaders, backhoes, excavators, and bulldozers, are commonly used to perform earth and debris moving tasks. To assist in the performance of these tasks, a work machine may be equipped with a control device that allows the operator to control the movements of the work machine from a remote location. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,448,479 to Kemner et al., a radio communication link may be established between an input device and the work machine. The operator may manipulate the input device to control the motions of the work machine to perform the desired work. The movement instructions are transmitted through a radio signal to the machine, which reacts accordingly.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">The work machine may be equipped with a camera to provide visual information to the operator regarding the location and operation of the work machine. The camera may provide images of the work site surrounding the work machine. The operator may view the images provided by the camera to control the work machine to complete the particular work task.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">However, a camera will not always provide sufficient information to allow the operator to efficiently operate the machine. During direct, i.e. non-remote, operation of the work machine, an operator may rely on physical indications from the machine when controlling the operation of the work machine. The operator may obtain these physical indications by watching the reaction of the work machine to the lifting or moving of a particular load. The operator may also obtain these physical indications by sensing movements of the work machine housing as a load is lifted or moved. If the operator observes that the work machine is having difficulty lifting or moving a load or if the operator feels the machine housing shift unexpectedly as a load is lifted or moved, the operator may vary the operation to prevent damage to the work machine. The images provided by the camera are not capable of providing this type of physical indication to a remote operator.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">The present disclosure is directed to solving one or more of the problems set forth above.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e849" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">One aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a control system for a work machine that has at least one hydraulic actuator. An input device is adapted to generate a movement signal to control the movement of the hydraulic actuator. A sensor is engaged with the hydraulic actuator and senses a parameter indicative of a magnitude of a force exerted by the hydraulic actuator. A first controller is disposed on the work machine and controls the motion of the hydraulic actuator. The first controller has a first receiver that receives the movement signal and a first transmitter that transmits a force signal including an indication of the force exerted by the hydraulic actuator. A second controller is operatively connected to the input device and has a second transmitter that transmits the movement signal and a second receiver that receives the force signal. A force generator is engaged with the input device and exerts a feedback force on the input device. The magnitude of the feedback force is related to the magnitude of the force exerted by the hydraulic actuator.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a method of remotely controlling a work machine. A movement signal is transmitted from a remote input device to a controller disposed on a work machine. At least one hydraulic actuator disposed on the work machine is moved in response to the movement signal. A parameter indicative of a magnitude of a force exerted by the at least one hydraulic actuator is sensed. A force signal having an indication of the magnitude of the force exerted by the at least one hydraulic actuator is transmitted. A feedback force is exerted on the input device. The magnitude of the feedback force is related to the magnitude of the force exerted by the hydraulic actuator.</p>

<p id="P-00017" num="00017">Input device <b>14</b> and control <b>18</b> may be adapted to generate a movement signal in response to movement instructions provided by an operator. Input device <b>14</b> may monitor each of the series of input mechanisms to detect a movement indicating that the operator is providing instructions for the work machine. When such an instruction is detected, input device <b>14</b> may convert the movement of the respective input mechanism into an electronic signal.

<p id="P-00018" num="00018">For example, an operator may desire to move work machine <b>200</b> in a certain direction. To cause this movement, the operator may manipulate the appropriate input mechanism, which may be, for example, a joystick. Input device <b>14</b> detects movement of the joystick and control <b>18</b> interprets the movement of joystick.

<p id="P-00044" num="00044">Control <b>18</b> may communicate the movement signal to telemetry device <b>24</b> of remote control assembly <b>12</b> to send the movement signal to telemetry device <b>102</b> of work machine control assembly <b>100</b>. (Step <b>304</b>) In particular, transmitter <b>26</b> of telemetry device <b>24</b> of remote control assembly <b>12</b> may send the movement signal to receiver <b>104</b> of telemetry device <b>102</b> on work machine control assembly <b>100</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the movement signal may be send through a radio transmission using any publicly available transmission frequency. One skilled in the art will recognize that movement signal may include an identification prefix to identify the intended work machine and may be sent using any frequency hopping device commonly used to transmit a radio signal.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">The received movement signal is communicated to control <b>108</b>, and control <b>108</b> processes the movement signal. (Step <b>306</b>). Control <b>108</b> may interpret the movement signal and make any necessary adjustments in the operation of work machine <b>200</b> to achieve the requested motion. For the swing movement signal described above, control <b>108</b> may open the control valve associated with swing assembly <b>114</b> to allow pressurized fluid to enter the hydraulic actuator associated with swing assembly <b>114</b>. The force exerted by the fluid will cause swing assembly <b>114</b> to move work implement <b>218</b> relative to vertical axis <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">As control <b>108</b> is processing movement signal, sensors <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, and <b>128</b> sense an operational parameter of work implement <b>218</b>. (Step <b>308</b>). For example, swing sensor <b>122</b> may sense a pressure indicative of the pressure of the fluid in a chamber of the hydraulic actuator associated with swing assembly <b>114</b>. Swing sensor <b>122</b> may transmit an indication of the magnitude of the fluid pressure to control <b>108</b> on a constant or periodic basis. If work implement <b>218</b> rotates steadily around vertical axis <b>234</b>, the sensed pressure will have a relatively constant magnitude. If, however, work implement <b>218</b> encounters an obstruction that abruptly stops movement of work implement <b>218</b>, the sensed pressure in the hydraulic actuator will increase suddenly, or spike.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">Control <b>108</b> receives the sensed pressures and generates a force signal. (Step <b>310</b>). The force signal contains information that indicates the magnitude of force exerted by one of the hydraulic actuators associated with work implement <b>218</b> or the resultant force on work implement <b>218</b>. Control <b>108</b> may send multiple force signals as the forces acting on work implement <b>218</b> change in response to different movement instructions from the operator.</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">Control <b>108</b> may communicate the movement signal to telemetry device <b>102</b> of work machine control assembly <b>100</b> to send the force signal to telemetry device <b>24</b> of remote control assembly <b>12</b>. (Step <b>312</b>) In particular, transmitter <b>106</b> of telemetry device <b>102</b> of work machine control assembly <b>100</b> may send the movement signal to receiver <b>28</b> of telemetry device <b>24</b> on remote control assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">The force signal is communicated to control <b>18</b> and control <b>18</b> causes force generator <b>16</b> to exert a corresponding feedback force on input device <b>14</b>. (Step <b>314</b>). The magnitude of the feedback force exerted on input device <b>14</b> by force generator <b>16</b> may be related to the force exerted by the work implement <b>218</b>. For example, the feedback force exerted on input device <b>14</b> may be proportional to the force exerted by work implement <b>218</b>. Alternatively, the feedback force exerted on input device <b>14</b> may be graduated, or stepped, to increase by a certain percentage as the magnitude of the force exerted by work implement <b>218</b> increases.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">In the swing movement example used above, force generator <b>16</b> may exert a first magnitude of feedback force on input device <b>14</b> that corresponds to the magnitude of force required to swing work implement <b>218</b> relative to vertical axis <b>234</b>. When work implement <b>218</b> contacts an obstruction that causes a pressure spike in the hydraulic actuator, the feedback force exerted by force generator <b>16</b> on input device <b>14</b> may increase proportionately.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">In addition, the feedback force exerted on input device <b>14</b> may be directed to oppose the motion of the input mechanism being manipulated by the operator. In the swing movement example, the operator may move a joystick in a certain direction to cause the work implement <b>218</b> to rotate about the vertical axis <b>234</b>. Force generator <b>16</b> may exert the feedback force on the joystick in the opposite direction that acts to move the joystick back to a center position. If the moving work implement <b>218</b> contacts an obstruction, the magnitude of the feedback force exerted on the joystick may increase to thereby move the joystick back to the center position. This may indicate to the user that the force required to continue moving work implement <b>218</b> in the desired is direction is greater than the maximum force that may be generated by work machine <b>200</b>. In this manner, control system <b>10</b> may provide tactile feedback to a remotely located operator of work machine <b>200</b>.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e3450" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">As will be apparent, the above-described control system provides tactile feedback to the operator of a remotely controlled work machine. The tactile feedback may provide the operator with information regarding the operation of the remote work machine, such as, for example, an indication of the current loads and/or forces being exerted by one or more of the hydraulic actuators associated with a work implement. This tactile feedback may be used by the operator to adjust the operation of the work machine, to increase the efficiency of the machine, and/or to prevent incurring damage to one or more of the work machine components.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">It is contemplated that the above-described control system may be used with any type of work machine. For example, the control system may be used with an excavator, a front shovel, a bulldozer, a backhoe, an articulated truck, or an off-highway truck. One skilled in the art will recognize that the principles of the present disclosure may also be applied to other applications.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the described system and method without departing from the scope of the invention. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope of the invention being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents.</p>

<p id="P-00002" num="00002">This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/701,235, filed Nov. 22, 2000 which is a 371 of PCT/ES99/00160 filed Jun. 3, 1999. Each of these prior applications is hereby incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety.</p>

<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention refers to a device for the coupling of excavator teeth which is applicable to the buckets of excavating machines and, in general, to the active working edges of earth-moving machines of similar types.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Machines for civil engineering work which effect the removal of materials such as earth, rocks, etc., generally have active edges on the so-called buckets of the excavators, which are open receptacles of specific shape fixed to the supporting and travelling gear of the machine and which have the function of removing the mass of earth or earth and more or less loose stones, by means of their front edge, collecting in the bucket the materials which have been loosened, allowing them to be transferred to a vehicle for their transport to another site or simply for depositing the mass of earth and stones which has been removed, for its subsequent replacement, for example, in the case of the opening of a trench.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">The buckets of excavators and the like suffer significant problems at the active edge because of the high degree of wear to which it is subjected by contact with the earth and stones, which have very abrasive characteristics. For this reason, it is necessary to equip the active edge of the excavator or similar machine with detachable teeth, which are removable components which bear the greater part of the wear by being in direct contact with the mass of earth and stones, and which are therefore parts which wear out very quickly. Said teeth, which are parts that can be exchanged fairly frequently, must combine characteristics which are to a certain extent contradictory, owing to the fact that, being parts which are changed frequently on excavating machines and the like, their price should be relatively low, so it is necessary to exclude mechanization of the teeth, which should be manufactured simply by casting or forging high strength steel. The other contradictory characteristic lies in the need for the mounting of the tooth on the tooth-carrier located at the active edge of the bucket for excavators or the like to be effected with sufficient adjustment to avoid as far as possible any play between the facing regions of the tooth-carrier and the tooth, since the occurrence, otherwise inevitable, of play in the said region results in an increase in the stresses at specific points of contact between the tooth and the tooth-carrier, which further increase the wear locally, in a process which may end in breakage of the parts and which involves changing the worn part, that is to say, the tooth, more or less frequently, according to how the above mentioned wear phenomena can be controlled to a greater or lesser degree.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">At present, many types of coupling between the teeth of excavators and the tooth-carriers are known, although all of them, given the contradictory conditions to be fulfilled and the hard work to which said components are subjected, exhibit defects with regard to what could be considered an ideal solution in terms of life of the tooth and avoidance of excessive wear on the tooth-carrier, enabling the latter to have an acceptably extended life.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,925 refers to a tooth assembly and retaining mechanism in which a nose portion matching with the socket of the tooth has parallel surfaces interconnected by a flat end surface.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,439 refers to an excavating tooth retaining means comprising a nose portion in which the tooth is fixed by means of a wedge in which the wear part lands directly against the holder.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">However, none of said patents discloses the double inverted dovetail structure which characterizes the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">In order to obtain an improvement in the characteristics of the couplings for excavator teeth, achieving rapidity of assembly and secure and durable coupling between the tooth and the tooth-carrier, the inventor of the present patent application has carried out investigations and tests which have resulted in a coupling for excavator teeth which has an improved performance in use.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">The coupling for excavator teeth and the like which is the subject of the invention is of the type which has a projection on the front face of the tooth-carrier, directed substantially axially with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tooth-carrier, and in which the cross-section of the tooth coupling region has a cross-section decreasing from the starting region to the free end, being characterized by the combination of the areas of contact between the tooth-carrier and the tooth, and the positioning of the retaining cotter pin, so that a close coupling is obtained between the tooth and the tooth-carrier, giving rise to secure fastening, with many areas of contact between the two coupled components, for the purpose of reducing the local wear and with an arrangement of angles of the areas of contact such that the stresses produced on the tooth tend to produce greater wedging and matching of the tooth with the tooth-carrier. In order to obtain this result, the area coupling the tooth with the tooth-carrier has a structure which is constituted basically by the joining of two reverse dovetail profiles, that is to say, the dovetail at the first end region being inverted compared to the dovetail at the second end region, corresponding to the starting region and the free end or point of the so-called &#x201c;nose&#x201d; of the tooth-carrier respectively. This is complemented by a slightly convex structure, above all of the upper area of junction between the base or start of the nose of the tooth-carrier and the end or projection thereof which has a uniform section. The area of junction of the upper curved part of the nose of the tooth-carrier with the base thereof has a narrow flat transverse region. The lateral faces of the nose of the tooth-carrier assume the form of facets, one of them corresponding to the front projection of constant section and another to the lateral faces, which may be flat or gently curved with the convexity towards the outside.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">With this arrangement the result is obtained that the nose of the tooth-carrier exhibits a much higher mechanical strength and, above all, in normal operation thereof no stresses are produced which tend to eject the tooth, which constitutes a recurrent problem of the currently known tooth-carriers. In particular, the slightly curved structure, with the convexity directed outwards, of the upper face of the nose of the tooth-carrier permits, in addition to a very efficient coupling between the tooth and the tooth-carrier, an increase in the cross-section of the nose of the tooth-carrier, and therefore a greater mechanical strength on the latter.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">The device of the present invention is likewise characterized by a new type of cotter pin for retaining the tooth on the tooth-carrier, which is distinguished by its easy introduction and high resistance to removal, basically comprising a body of the cotter pin of flattened generally parallelepipedal structure, which on one of its intermediate sized faces has a wide rebate to which there is joined, by means of vulcanization of a special rubber, an insert carrying a small lateral projection with rounded transverse edges which is intended to be introduced into a seating of complementary shape of the tooth-carrier after its introduction.</p>

<p id="P-00021" num="00021">As shown in the Figures, the coupling for excavator teeth which is the subject of the present invention has a fork-like part <b>1</b> intended for coupling with the edge of the excavator bucket and a region <b>2</b> that projects from the rear face <b>3</b> of the region <b>1</b> and is intended to receive the excavator tooth, indicated by <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 14</figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">The upper face <b>20</b> of the nose of the tooth-carrier has a generally curved shape with the convexity directed outwards, joining the inner end of the projection <b>14</b> to the body <b>1</b> of the tooth-carrier by means of a small flat area in the area of junction with the said body indicated by <b>21</b> in FIG. <b>1</b> and also in FIG. <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">The lateral faces <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> may be flat or curved, with the convexity directed outwards.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The construction of the nose of the tooth-carrier with the shape indicated makes it possible to obtain a much higher strength thereon, at the same time eliminating the reactions of ejection of the tooth which customarily occur in the currently known mountings for excavator teeth.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">As will he observed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 15</figref>, the cotter pin <b>19</b> has a flattened straight, generally parallelepipedal structure, having on one of its minor sides a wide indentation <b>22</b> in which, by means of a vulcanized coating <b>23</b>, there is effected the joining of a straight insert <b>24</b>, carrying a lateral projection <b>25</b>, provided with rounded edges, which is engaged in a recess of complementary shape of the nose of the tooth-carrier.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">This arrangement of the cotter pin therefore makes possible both its easy introduction by axial compression in its groove and sufficient retention thereof in the nose of the tooth-carrier. Withdrawal is also facilitated by the existence of the joining part of vulcanized rubber.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">By means of the arrangement which has been explained, the coupling device for excavator teeth which is the subject of the present invention makes it possible to fit the tooth with minimum play in all the coupling areas, as well as allowing numerous areas of contact in order to reduce local wear, and reduces the force components in the direction of ejection of the tooth with respect to the tooth-carrier.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">As it is obvious, this invention will cover the tooth holder as well as the tooth to be adapted to the same, which will have a form which is conjugated to the form of the mating tube holder, with cavities to receive the coupling device.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">The characteristics of the cotter pin are also very advantageous, both as regards the ease of assembly and disassembly of the cotter pin and as regards the high holding force thereof.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e557" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The invention relates to a device for ironing laundry.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">A number of embodiments are already known for arranging the layer of textile in resiliently yielding manner on the periphery of the roller. Ribbons with helical springs are used for this purpose, which helical springs are arranged on a strip-like carrier in a fully automatic operation, which carrier is wound as a spiral round the roller. A fabric or textile cloth, usually is flannel cloth, is then normally wound in two or more layers over the protruding springs. The yielding of the covering serves to hold the laundry firmly against the inner wall of the bed, so that a good ironing progression is ensured. In another embodiment the helical springs are replaced by resilient plates which are also wound helically round the roller on a carrier. The drawback of these known systems is that assembly is quite complicated because of the helical form, wherein the resilient tongues in the above stated second embodiment do not form a precisely closed cylindrical support surface for the textile layer. In addition, the springs can easily be damaged in the known systems when the covering is replaced.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">To overcome some of the mentioned problems U.S. Pat. No. 1,432,940 proposed an element with a carrier and a plurality of spring members secured to the carrier with free ends which are overlapping in one direction. U.S. Pat. No. 298,780 proposes a similar element using circular curved leaf springs secured at their butts to a belt wrapped upon the roller. Both systems have the drawback that they do not form a precisely closed cylinder surface.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">A third American patent, U.S. Pat. No. 3,115,717 describes a system which uses as well a plurality of elastic elements comprising each a first portion connected to a strip-like support, and a second portion which is rendered coplanar with the adjacent second portion by means of a recess in which the edge of the adjacent second portion extends. In that way the flatness of the support surface is improved. However, the surface still shows grooves where the edge extends in the recess.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">Another spring module is known from Great Britain Patent No. 1,518,433. This module has a carrier which is provided with interlocking means for connecting the module with an adjacent module. This system simplifies the assembling of the modules, but again has the drawback of a non-continuous support surface when fitted on a roller.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e597" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">The invention has for its object to obviate the above stated drawbacks and provides for this purpose a device which is distinguished in that the resilient member is engaged with the adjoining resilient members, such that a continuous practically cylindrical support face is obtained.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Owing to the fact that the elongate carrier runs parallel to the roller axis, these carriers can easily be adjusted to the length of the roller and ensure a much better resilience, so that it is possible to suffice with only one layer of textile on the resilient elements without the danger of the textile tearing.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">According to a further development of the invention it is recommended to provide the carrier with attaching members for mutually attaching adjoining carriers in the assembled situation. Assembly can hereby be simplified considerably, because only the first row of carriers are mounted on the roller wall parallel to the rotation axis of the roller with a screw or rivet and the like, whereafter the leading carriers relative to the rotation direction of the roller are attached to the preceding carriers.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">According to the invention each strip-like resilient member is further bent, the end part of which remote from the carrier extends at a distance from and practically parallel to the roller wall in the assembled situation and is provided with attaching means for the textile layer. A practically cylindrical support surface for the textile layer is obtained with this embodiment. Owing to the good attachment, the covering itself does not have to take a strong nature, since the friction forces are transferred directly via the resilient members onto the roller.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">In order to further enhance this cylindrical support surface, it is recommended to provide each strip-like member close to the bend with an opening, and to embody it at the end part thereof with a tongue-shaped protrusion which in the assembled situation can be received in the opening of the adjoining resilient member. The resilient strip is hereby supported both on the free end remote from the roller and by the carrier, which prevent spreading of the resilient members and therefore improves a perfect continueous cylindrical support surface. Such a structure allows the use of a relatively thin covering placed in a single layer. The resilient members will moreover not be damaged when the covering is withdrawn for replacement.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">In order to cause the resilience to develop more smoothly, it is recommended to decrease the width of the intermediate part of the strip-like resilient member located between carrier and end part by means of recesses. These recesses can lie on the side or in the middle part itself.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">It is further recommended to form the carrier from a flat strip, wherein the attaching means according to the present invention consist of openings on the one hand and a hook-shaped protrusion resilient relative to the strip on the other, which protrusion can be guided in each case into the co-acting opening of the adjoining resilient member in the assembled situation.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">The invention finally also relates to a resilient element suitable for a device as described above, wherein the carrier and the resilient members with associated attaching means are formed integrally from a punched strip of material such that the axially mounted carriers with the resilient members can be assembled as a jacket around the roller. It is recommend to use strips having different width; so obtaining different steps, e.g. a strip-profile of 20 mm and 19 mm. In this way the total length can easily be adapted to the circumference length of the drum. Further the strips may have a different height, such that a smooth overlap of the single covering layer can easily be formed.</p>

<p id="P-00022" num="00022">Designated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with the numeral <b>1</b> is the bed, of which only the inner wall is shown, and the support edge <b>2</b> with which the laundry (not shown) is guided to the roller <b>3</b>. Roller <b>3</b> is supported in a housing (not shown) for rotation on bearings <b>4</b> and is rotated in the direction of arrow P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">Defined between roller <b>3</b> and the inner wall of bed <b>1</b> is a space which is wholly or partially filled by a flexible layer of a textile layer on the outside which is supported resiliently, this being further elucidated hereinbelow. Textile layer <b>5</b> can be of any random type and is usually a flannel fabric or preferably needle felt which is per se already resilient, but which is further supported by resilient elements <b>6</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, so that textile layer <b>5</b> can be compressed in the direction of roller <b>3</b>. Textile layer <b>5</b> is attached or hooked to the resilient elements and wrapped round the roller counter to the rotation direction P<b>1</b>, so that during rotation in the direction of arrow P<b>1</b> the textile layer <b>5</b> winds itself tight due to the generated friction during rotation of the roller.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">Resilient elements <b>6</b> are shown in detail on larger scale in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, wherein each resilient element consists of a carrier <b>10</b>, which is strip-like, and strip-like spring leaves <b>11</b> directed transversely thereof. The spring leaves consist of a middle part <b>12</b> and an end part <b>13</b>, wherein middle part <b>12</b> is bent at the line A&#x2014;A, so that end part <b>13</b> runs practically parallel to strip-like carrier <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">The end part <b>13</b> is provided with attaching members <b>14</b> which serve to attach the textile layer <b>5</b> thereon.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">In the bend transition A&#x2014;A a space is recessed in the form of an elongate hole <b>15</b>, the function of which is elucidated below. On the free end remote from opening <b>15</b> the end part <b>13</b> is provided with a tongue-shaped protrusion <b>16</b> which serves for placing in the opening <b>15</b> of an adjoining resilient element.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">Carrier <b>10</b> is embodied with a number of resilient hook-shaped members <b>17</b> and a second elongate opening <b>18</b> close to the foot of middle part <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">The middle part <b>12</b> is itself recessed along the side edges at <b>19</b> in order to gradually decrease the width, i.e. the material cross-section thereof, so that a better resilience is realized.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Carrier <b>10</b> is further provided with openings which can be distributed at random to allow a free flow of air.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the carrier <b>10</b> is provided in each case with four strip-like resilient members <b>11</b>, although it will be apparent that within the scope of the invention the carriers <b>10</b> can be much longer and can contain many more elements.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">The mounting of the resilient elements on the roller takes place such that carriers <b>10</b> are fixed mutually adjacently on the roller wall in a line parallel to the rotation axis of roller <b>3</b>. This fixing can take place for instance by means of pop rivets, screws or other suitable fixing means, this such that one row of carriers and strip-like resilient members pointing in a direction opposite to the rotation direction P<b>1</b> come to lie on the roller <b>3</b> along the full length thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">The following rows can then be mounted in simple manner by placing the tongue <b>16</b> through a hole <b>15</b> and then pressing hole <b>18</b> over the hook-shaped resilient elements <b>17</b> such that they are then snapped fixedly thereon. Thus is created a continuous layer of carriers which are partially overlapping in the roller periphery direction, and a support layer <b>30</b> results, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which consists of the upper surface of the end parts <b>13</b> of the resilient element. This support surface <b>30</b> serves to support textile layer <b>5</b>. The textile layer is hooked fixedly on the hook-like pins <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">In order to realize the overlap at the front and rear end of textile layer <b>5</b>, an intermediate layer of flatter, and therefore, lower, resilient elements, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, will be initially hooked together, wherein tongues <b>16</b> can be severed along the line B&#x2014;B and the hook-shaped elements <b>17</b> can be flattened. For this purpose the carriers can be shifted under the first arranged and fixed carriers of the high elements, wherein the end edge of end parts <b>13</b> of the low resilient elements can support on the inclining middle parts <b>12</b> of the high elements at the other end thereof. Once fitted, the front end of textile layer <b>5</b> can be hooked onto the low elements and then wound round support surface <b>30</b> of the high elements. The rear end of textile layer <b>5</b> lies freely on the recessed part of the front end thereof, see FIG. <b>2</b>. It is thus possible to suffice with only one covering layer. Due to the perfect cylindrical surface the covering can be formed from cheap needle felt. The covering suffice to be thin. In this embodiment of a single layer cover, the fabric layer can be provided with indication means, for instance a colored metal line embedded in said fabric, which will be exposed when the layer is abraded. A metal line or thread <b>52</b> can be part of an electrical circuit, suitable to generate a warning signal when exposed. Superposed covering layers of different color <b>50</b> can also be used. Once a different color is exposed the layer will be replaced.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1199" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">Generally stated, a novel window display powered by solar energy is presented. To summarize, the unique window display includes a vehicle body removablely attached to a frame securable to a window. The display also includes at least one wheel that rotates by means of a drive mechanism powered by light.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">Although the display is discussed in detail as a window display, it is envisioned that the display may rest on a table top or other substantially flat surface with an appropriate supporting base for the frame. The supporting base (not shown) may be a block made out of wood, plastic or other suitable material adapted to support the frame.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> depict one embodiment of a window display in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The window display may be constructed employing a rigid, generally planar frame <b>10</b> having a front panel <b>12</b> and a back panel <b>14</b> adapted to be disposed in an upright position. Front panel <b>12</b> has supported thereon a vehicle or a portion of a vehicle <b>20</b> having front and rear wheels <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. In one embodiment, back panel <b>14</b> supports the drive mechanics within a casing (not shown) for operating certain components of the window display. In an alternate embodiment, the drive mechanism may be supported on the front panel and hidden from view by a casing or, alternatively, behind the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">In one embodiment, vehicle <b>20</b> is a three-dimensional model. In an alternate embodiment, vehicle <b>20</b> is a two dimensional picture, such as, for example, a sticker, decal or drawing of a vehicle. Vehicle <b>20</b> may, for example, depict a NASCAR, Busch series truck or Indy car having thereon decals representing specific drivers or advertisement sponsors resembling scaled down models of actual race cars on, e.g., the NASCAR circuit. Although, other vehicles, such as, for example, sports cars, classic cars, motorcycles, bicycles, airplanes and the like, and other themes may be depicted.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Vehicle <b>20</b> is removably attached to front panel <b>12</b> of frame <b>10</b> and therefore may be selected from a plurality of possible vehicles representing different vehicles and themes. For two-dimensional pictures or decals, an adhesive, Velcro or the like may removably attach vehicle <b>20</b>. For three-dimensional models, vehicle <b>20</b> may rest on a bottom frame supporting wheel axles <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. Alternatively, vehicle body <b>20</b> may attach by accessible and removable screws (as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>), Velcro, straps and snaps, press-fit or other fastening means to front panel <b>12</b> of frame <b>10</b>. Alternatively, thumb tabs or hooks may be incorporated into the vehicle bodies and adapted to fit into slots in front panel <b>12</b> or frame <b>10</b> and lock into place. In yet another embodiment, vehicle <b>20</b> could have tabs that slide into a groove or slot formed in frame <b>10</b> and lock into place. This would enable the vehicle bodies to be changed by pushing on the tabs and popping the bodies off. The use of male and female connectors that snap or click together may also be used to removably attach vehicle <b>20</b> to frame <b>10</b>. By removably attaching the vehicle to front panel <b>12</b>, the vehicle displayed is interchangeable with other vehicle models or pictures. For example, in an embodiment in which the vehicle depicts a NASCAR theme, the user may interchange the NASCAR model displayed depending on which car won the last NASCAR race or on changes on preference of favorite drivers or</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">Wheels <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be disks or toy wheels, of any suitable material, mounted for rotation about respective front and rear axles <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. In one embodiment, front and rear axles <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> extend through frame <b>10</b> and are adapted to rotate by, for example, a bearing surface within an opening formed in frame <b>10</b>. The bearing surface should permit rotary motion of axles <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> while resisting any radial motion that would cause the wheels to rotate eccentrically. In one embodiment, a bottom frame that supports the axles of the three-dimensional model may be used and inserted through the frame. In this embodiment, models that fit this particular bottom frame may be displayed by cutting the vehicle body down the middle from front to back and attaching the same to frame <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref> depict one embodiment of the drive mechanics on rear panel <b>14</b>. Front and rear axles <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> each have attached a pulley wheel <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> for driving the axles. Each pulley wheel <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> includes a single groove formed in the rim and adapted to receive a drive belt <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. Drive belts <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may be a flexible friction band made from a compressible material such as silicone. A motor <b>40</b> drives wheel pulleys <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> attached to each wheel axle. One suitable motor that may be used is a miniature DC motor that operates from 0.5 to 3 volts with no load and 15 mA/start-up 100 mA, which is sold as model MC-05/07 by Mabuchi Motor Co., Ltd. of Japan.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">Motor <b>40</b> is mounted to frame <b>10</b> and operably connected to wheel pulleys <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> by a drive wheel <b>44</b> attached to the motor drive shaft <b>42</b>. Drive wheel <b>44</b> includes two grooves formed in the rim and adapted to receive drive belts <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> connecting drive wheel <b>44</b> with wheel pulleys <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. In an alternate embodiment, motor <b>40</b> includes two drive wheels coupled to drive shaft <b>42</b> for accommodating drive belts <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> from each of the wheel pulleys.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">In an alternate embodiment, drive shaft <b>42</b> of the motor <b>40</b> may be coupled directly to one of the rotating wheels. In this embodiment, there is no need for a pulley wheel and drive belt to drive the wheel directly attached to drive shaft <b>42</b> of motor <b>40</b>. The other wheel may be driven by its own respective motor or, alternatively by a pulley wheel connected by a drive belt to a drive wheel coupled to the drive shaft of the motor directly attached to the other wheel.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">In an embodiment in which the drive mechanics are supported by front panel <b>12</b>, flanges that extend outwardly from front panel <b>12</b> may support the vehicle body, motor(s) and wheel axle such that the drive mechanism is positioned on front panel <b>12</b>, e.g. behind vehicle body <b>20</b>, rather than on rear panel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">Motor <b>40</b> is energized by DC current produced by at least one conventional photovoltaic power cell <b>50</b> in response to exposure to light. One suitable photovoltaic cell that may be used is a one-volt power panel with a 500 mA output in maximum sunlight sold under the name Solarts by Solar World of Colorado Springs, Colo. Photovoltaic cell <b>50</b> may be mounted to front panel <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the photovoltaic cell <b>50</b> is pivotably mounted to front panel <b>12</b> such that the cell may be adjusted and angled towards the light source. A layer of glass that is mounted against the power cell protects the power cell. A pair of leads <b>52</b> extends through the frame and connects with terminals of motor <b>40</b> in a conventional manner.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">Although the main source of power for the display is a photovoltaic cell, other sources of electrical power may be used as backup or auxiliary power. For example, backup electrical power could be supplied from batteries mounted on the rear panel or from a conventional electrical outlet or a cigarette lighter adaptor plug wired to the display. The batteries may be recharged by the photovoltaic cell. An on/off switch may also be provided in series with the motor terminals to turn the display on and off.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">Frame <b>10</b> is provided with a releasable fastening means for securing the window display to an interior vehicle window surface. In one embodiment, frame <b>10</b> includes at least one stanchion <b>16</b> that projects from front panel <b>12</b> of frame <b>10</b>, with a suitable glass panel attachment means, comprised of, for example, suction cups <b>18</b> at a point just clear of the ornamentation on front panel <b>12</b>. In alternate embodiments, other mounting means could include a suitable pressure adhesive, magnetics, hooks attachable to the upper portion of a window or Velcro-type patches. The mounting should provide a secure attachment such that a window (e.g. an automobile window) may be decorated in a very convenient and reliable manner while exposing the photovoltaic cells to sufficient light to power the motor.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">The window display may also include other visual and audible features. For example, the vehicle may include headlights, brake lights, or interior lights in the form of LEDs connected by a wire lead to, for example, the photovoltaic cell, a battery, an electrical outlet, or the like. A pictorial scene or advertisement may be disposed on the other portions of the front panel, which may also be lighted. The display may also include a speaker for producing vehicle or other related noise such as, for example, the sound of a running automobile engine, a horn, the cheer of the crowd or the like.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">Although preferred embodiments have been depicted and described in detail herein, it will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art that various modifications, additions, substitutions and the like can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and these are therefore considered to be within the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1233" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="P-00029" num="heading-00029">Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a whole structure of an apparatus for displaying a flying object.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">A group <b>10</b> of blowers creates an air flow <b>15</b> in space in which the flying object flies. It is possible that the group <b>10</b> of blowers includes a plurality of blowers <b>11</b>. It is also possible that the group <b>10</b> of blowers includes only one blower <b>11</b>. Further, the group <b>10</b> of blowers can create the air flow <b>15</b> by either blowing or drawing gas. It is also possible that a double reverse blower functioning as both a blower with a clockwise rotary fan and a blower with a counterclockwise rotary fan is provided in the group <b>10</b> of blowers.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">When there is a flow of rotation in flying space <b>25</b>, flight itself of a lightweight flying object <b>30</b> becomes unstable. Therefore, it is necessary to set honeycomb rectifier grids etc. in a honeycomb shape in an upstream side in the flying space. When an axial flow blower in a double reverse method or an axial flow blower with a static wing is used as the blower <b>11</b>, a flow of a direction component of rotation is very little in a blowing flow. Therefore, it is possible to provide the flying space <b>25</b> in which the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can fly stably without specially setting rectifier grids.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">The air flow <b>15</b> is created by the group <b>10</b> of blowers. It is possible to fill an inside of a duct with gas besides air. In that case, the air flow <b>15</b> is replaced with a flow of the concerning gas.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">A duct <b>20</b> forms a passage for carrying the gas, e.g., air, etc. The duct forms the space in which the flying object flies. In the duct <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the air flow <b>15</b> in a counterclockwise direction is created. A shape of the duct <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example of a space forming unit. It is not necessary that duct <b>20</b> is in this shape, and the duct <b>20</b> can be in any shape. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the duct <b>20</b> is connected to a drawing side and a blowing side of the group <b>10</b> of blowers.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">The lightweight flying object <b>30</b> flies along the air flow <b>15</b> created by the group <b>10</b> of blowers in the flying space <b>25</b> formed by the duct <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">As stated, in the apparatus for displaying the flying object in this embodiment, the group <b>10</b> of blowers including one or the plurality of blowers <b>11</b> is attached to the duct <b>20</b> in a circulating method. The air flow <b>15</b> sent from the group of blowers <b>10</b> is a rectified flow. The air flow <b>15</b> flows through a guide blade <b>21</b> in an inlet side which is curved by the duct <b>20</b>, and reaches the flying space <b>25</b>. Then, the air flow, <b>15</b> returns to the group <b>10</b> of blowers via a guide blade <b>22</b> in an outlet side. As stated, the duct has a circulating structure, and the air flow <b>15</b> circulates in the duct <b>20</b>. Therefore, it is possible to create the air flow <b>15</b> which is stable even if the apparatus for displaying the flying object is surrounded by other devices. Accordingly, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can fly stably.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">A holding line <b>40</b> is connected to the lightweight flying object <b>30</b>. A guide unit <b>50</b> is a hole for the holding line <b>40</b> to move in or out. The holding line <b>40</b> is wounded on a spool <b>60</b>. A controlling unit <b>70</b> controls the holding line <b>40</b> and the group <b>10</b> of blowers in reacting to change in sound and light transferred from a microphone <b>80</b> and an optical sensor <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">The holding line <b>40</b> is extended from the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> and connected to the spool <b>60</b> below the duct <b>20</b> through the guide unit <b>50</b>. The spool <b>60</b> is connected to the controlling unit <b>70</b>, and the controlling unit <b>70</b> is connected to the microphone <b>80</b> and the optical sensor <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">A flower <b>100</b> which is either real or artificial is placed on a bottom of the duct <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">The holding line <b>40</b> attached to the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is explained.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">A line is fixed to an axis <b>31</b> of an airframe at two or one points, which is included in a fuselage of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b>. When the line is fixed at two points, an end of the line is fixed to an upstream point than an aerodynamic center of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b>, and the other end of the line is fixed to a downstream point. The holding line <b>40</b> is attached to a certain point of the line fixed to the axis <b>31</b> of the airframe. A position for attaching the holding line <b>40</b> can be adjusted. When the line is fixed at one point, the holding line <b>40</b> is attached almost to an aerodynamic center of the axis <b>31</b> of the airframe directly. The position for attaching the holding line <b>40</b> can be changed. When the position is determined once, it is also possible to fix the position.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">As stated, the apparatus for displaying the flying object includes the group <b>10</b> of blowers for creating the air flow <b>15</b> and the duct <b>20</b> for forming the flying space. Movement of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is restricted as the holding line <b>40</b> is attached to the lightweight flying object <b>30</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to make the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> fly using the air flow <b>15</b> in the space formed by the duct <b>20</b>. Specifically, since the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is restricted by the holding line <b>40</b>, it is possible to make the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> fly even in small space.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">As stated later, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> has an airframe in a small size. Therefore, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can fly by lift instead of flying by drag like a traditional kite. Hence, it is sufficient if the holding line <b>40</b> can sustain tension of approximately a few gf, i.e., several ten mN (millinewton). The holding line <b>40</b> can be made of gut or a very thin tungsten wire, etc.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">Therefore, the holding line <b>40</b> is almost invisible from an outside, and the lightweight flying object looks like floating in the apparatus for displaying the flying object. Consequently, entertainment characteristics as the apparatus for displaying the flying object can be improved.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">Next, the controlling unit <b>70</b> is explained.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">The controlling unit <b>70</b> controls the change in the air flow <b>15</b> in the duct <b>20</b> by changing at least one of a rotation number of the blower <b>11</b>, a number of blowers <b>11</b> operating, and a blowing direction based on a signal from an input device, e.g., the microphone <b>80</b>, optical sensor <b>90</b>, etc. attached to the apparatus for displaying the flying object. Further, the controlling unit <b>70</b> controls a flying condition of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> by changing a length of the holding line <b>40</b> based on the input signal from the input device, e.g., the microphone <b>80</b>, optical sensor <b>90</b>, etc. attached to the apparatus for displaying the flying object.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">As stated, the controlling unit <b>70</b> reacts to a change in surroundings provided externally, and converts the change in the surroundings into a signal. The holding line <b>40</b> and the air flow <b>15</b> created by the group <b>10</b> of blowers are controlled by the converted signal. By controlling this way, an altitude and a flying attitude of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can be changed. Therefore, the apparatus for displaying the flying object can attract viewers. Further, the entertainment characteristics of this embodiment can be realized. The change in the surroundings provided externally includes all the changes, e.g., change in sound, change in light, change in vibration, change in magnetism, etc., which can be received by the controlling unit <b>70</b> as the signal.</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">The lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is explained in details.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">The lightweight flying object <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes the fuselage which has the axis <b>31</b> of the airframe in a center of the flying object. A right wing and a left wing are attached symmetrically with respect to the axis <b>31</b> of the airframe included in the fuselage. It is not necessary that a number of the wings is two. It is possible that one wing or a plurality of wings are attached. Further, a strengthening member is joined to the right wing and the left wing for improving strength of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">A wing surface of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is made with very light paper or nonwoven fabric with weight of 30 g or less per unit area. On the wing surface, a natural creature, e.g., butterfly, bird, dragonfly, etc. or an artificial object, e.g., aircraft, etc. are printed. In this embodiment, an image of the butterfly is printed. However, any natural object, artificial object, imaginary object, etc. can be printed as far as it is light and appropriate for flying and it can attract viewers.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">A plane shape of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is aerodynamically symmetrical with respect to the axis <b>31</b> of the airframe for improving flight stability. For the wing surface of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b>, lightweight material, e.g., CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics) or FRP (Fiber Reinforced Plastics) or plastics or cypress, etc. is used as the strengthening member. Structural members are placed mostly in a leading edge part <b>32</b> of the wing of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b>, and is structured to sustain the wing surface in the downstream side of the axis <b>31</b> of the airframe. Therefore, the wing can be sustained. A spring component, e.g., CFRP, etc. is bowed and attached to a horizontal timber of the axis <b>31</b> of the airframe of the wing for providing a dihedral in the lightweight flying object <b>30</b>. Because of the dihedral, force for restoring a horizontal flying attitude of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is produced, and the stability of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> in a roll direction (rotation direction) is increased. Further, a trailing edge part <b>33</b> of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> leans upward with respect to the axis <b>31</b> of the airframe, and the stability in a pitching direction (vertical direction) is also increased by effect of a tail wing.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">When a flying object is heavy, it is necessary that an aerodynamic center and a position of a fine line are almost at a position of gravity to make the flying object stable in the pitching direction. In this case, the center of gravity of the flying object is almost in a middle of the axis <b>31</b> of the airframe, and the aerodynamic center is also almost in the middle of the axis <b>31</b> of the airframe. Therefore, an angle of attack of the flying object is large, and the flying object goes into a stall and comes to fly by drag.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">However, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> in this embodiment is very light, and pitch-up moment due to the gravity is small. Therefore, the angle of attack is reduced, and the aerodynamic center is positioned at a downstream point than the leading edge part <b>32</b> of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> by a quarter chord length. It is still stable even when the fine line is moved slightly upstream from the position. Specifically, even though the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is restricted by the holding line <b>40</b>, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> does not fly by drag like an ordinary kite, but the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can fly by lift.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">As stated, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> in this embodiment includes the wing made of lightweight paper, nonwoven fabric, etc. A frame made of CFRP or FRP or plastics or wood, etc. of which strength per weight is high is joined to the wing surface. Therefore, a load of the wing surface can be reduced. Consequently, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> becomes able to fly stably. It is also possible to reduce a minimum flying velocity of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b>. Accordingly, movement of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> which flutters slowly can give comfort and healing to the viewers. Further, since the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> as a whole is in a shape which imitates a natural object, e.g., butterfly, bird, etc. or an artificial object, e.g., aircraft, etc., the viewers get a strong impression on the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> which is flying.</p>
<p id="P-00055" num="00055">Next, gas volume of the air flow <b>15</b> created by the group <b>10</b> of blowers is explained. The gas volume of the air flow <b>15</b> created by the group <b>10</b> of blowers is controlled by the controlling unit <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00056" num="00056">Since the apparatus for displaying the flying object is placed in a show window, etc., it is important that the apparatus for displaying the flying object is compact. When a width of a passageway of the duct <b>20</b> is approximately. 450 mm which is appropriate for displaying, a span (wingspan) of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> must be approximately &#x2153; of the width of the passageway of the duct <b>20</b>. Otherwise, flight lacks variations, and entertainment effect becomes less. Therefore, when flight of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> with a span of 150 mm and a chord length of approximately 80 mm is assumed, Reynolds number is small as the weight of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is light. Hence, maximum lift coefficient is approximately 0.5. When the wing surface is made of nonwoven fabric of 40 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and a weight of a frame of the structural member is 1.3 g, a total weight L of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is approximately 1.8 g. Therefore, when a density of the air is p, a capacity coefficient is CL, and a section of the passageway of the air flow <b>15</b> is S, a minimum velocity U of the air flow <b>15</b> flowing through the duct <b>20</b>, which is necessary for making the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> fly, can be obtained using the following equation:

<p id="P-00066" num="00066">Therefore, the gas volume N at 24 m<sup>3 </sup>per minute is sufficient, and it is possible to make the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> fly by the blower <b>11</b> in a small size, e.g., ventilator.</p>
<p id="P-00067" num="00067">As stated, the weight of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is reduced, and the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> becomes able to fly even at low gas volume. Therefore, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can fly softly by lift, and it becomes possible to reduce a noise of the group <b>10</b> of blowers.</p>
<p id="P-00068" num="00068">Next, a control method by the controlling unit <b>70</b> using the microphone <b>80</b> and the optical sensor <b>90</b> is explained.</p>
<p id="P-00069" num="00069">The controlling unit <b>70</b> converts a change of sound and a change of light into a signal, and controls the spool <b>60</b> for adjusting the length of the holding line <b>40</b> based on the converted signal. Further, the controlling unit <b>70</b> adjusts the air flow <b>15</b> by changing a rotation number of the blowers <b>11</b>, a number of blowers operating, timing of operation of each of blowers <b>11</b> in the group <b>10</b> of blowers, etc. According to this function, the length of the holding line <b>40</b> is changed in reacting to clapping by the viewers or rotary spot light, and an altitude of flight and a flight attitude of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can be changed. Further, by changing the rotation number of the blowers <b>11</b> and the number of blowers operating, velocity of the air flow <b>15</b> flowing toward the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is changed, and the lift of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is changed. Accordingly, an angle of inclination of the holding line <b>40</b> is changed, and a flowing direction position and the altitude of flight of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can be changed. Further, movement of flying can be synchronized with music and lighting by a random signal provided externally. It is also possible that the movement of flying can be synchronized with music and lighting by sending a signal from the controlling unit <b>70</b> to the spool <b>60</b> of the holding line and the blower <b>11</b> based on a predetermined sequence.</p>
<p id="P-00070" num="00070">As stated, the altitude and the flying attitude of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can be changed using an external signal by changing the length of the holding line <b>40</b> by the controlling unit <b>70</b> based on the signal from an input device, e.g., the microphone <b>80</b>, optical sensor <b>90</b>, etc. attached to the apparatus for displaying the flying object.</p>
<p id="P-00071" num="00071">The altitude and the flying attitude of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can be also changed using the external signal by changing the rotation number of the blower <b>11</b>, the number of blowers <b>11</b> operating, and a blowing position by the controlling unit <b>70</b> based on the signal from the input device, e.g., the microphone <b>80</b>, optical sensor <b>90</b>, etc. attached to the apparatus for displaying the flying object.</p>
<p id="P-00072" num="00072">Further, by changing the length of the holding line <b>40</b>, rotation of the blower <b>11</b>, and a blowing position in reacting to music from a speaker or lighting accompanied by the apparatus for displaying the flying object, it becomes possible to make the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> dance suitably for a situation of people gathering in a display place. Hence, the entertainment characteristics of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="P-00073" num="00073">Next, takeoff of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> using a guide unit <b>50</b> is explained.</p>
<p id="P-00074" num="00074">Before takeoff, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is in the bottom of the duct <b>20</b>, where velocity of the air flow <b>15</b> is low. Hence, for making the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> take off, it is necessary to move the lightweight flying objet <b>30</b> to an area in a middle of the duct <b>20</b>, where the velocity of the air flow <b>15</b> is high. The lightweight flying object <b>30</b> takes off in the following sequence.</p>
<p id="P-00075" num="00075">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the holding line <b>40</b> passes through an inside of the guide unit <b>50</b> extended from a bottom of the duct <b>20</b> toward the flying space <b>25</b>. At takeoff, the holding line <b>40</b> is wound by the spool <b>60</b>, and the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is moved up from the bottom of the duct <b>20</b> to a top of the guide unit <b>50</b>. Since the velocity of the air flow <b>15</b> at the top of the guide unit <b>50</b> is high, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can start flying at this moment. When the flight of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> becomes stable, the length of the holding line <b>40</b> is made longer by the spool <b>60</b> of the holding line, and the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> starts flying freely in the duct <b>20</b>. The guide unit <b>50</b> can have any structure, e.g., pipe shape as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a shape including a bar and a ring at an end of the bar, which is not illustrated, etc. as far as a fulcrum is provided for the holding line <b>40</b>. For example, the guide unit <b>50</b> can be in a shape of a frog or a praying mantis. In this case, by making the guide unit <b>50</b> in the shape of the frog move almost to eat the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> in a shape of a butterfly, the apparatus for displaying becomes more attractive.</p>
<p id="P-00076" num="00076">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the guide unit <b>50</b> is fixed to the duct <b>20</b>. However, a height of the guide unit <b>50</b> can be variable. For example, it is possible to operate the guide unit <b>50</b> vertically by making a hole on a bottom of the duct <b>20</b> in which the guide unit <b>50</b> is set. When the guide unit <b>50</b> itself has an elastic structure like a spring, it is possible to operate the guide unit <b>50</b> vertically without making the hole on the bottom of the duct <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00077" num="00077">As stated, the top of the guide unit <b>50</b> extended from the bottom of the duct <b>20</b> to an inside of the space formed by the duct <b>20</b>, which is fixed or can be operated vertically, is provided as the fulcrum for the holding line <b>40</b>, and the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can start flying from the fulcrum. Therefore, at an initial stage of flight sequence, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can move to a middle part of the air flow <b>15</b> in the duct <b>20</b> using the guide unit <b>50</b>, and the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can take off easily. Further, by moving the guide unit <b>50</b> higher at takeoff and moving the guide unit <b>50</b> lower after transition to flying, the flying space <b>25</b> of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can be increased. Accordingly, flight airspace of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can be increased.</p>
<p id="P-00078" num="00078">Next, a structure of the duct <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is explained in details.</p>
<p id="P-00079" num="00079">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the duct <b>20</b> is connected to a drawing side and a blowing side of the group <b>10</b> of blowers. Specifically, the group <b>10</b> of blowers is set in the space formed by the duct <b>20</b>, and the air flow <b>15</b> created by the group <b>10</b> of blowers is circulated in the inside of the duct <b>20</b>. In the duct <b>20</b>, the guide blade <b>21</b> in the inlet side is provided in the upstream side and the guide blade <b>22</b> in the outlet side is provided in the downstream side. Then, the duct is further connected to the group <b>10</b> of blowers. Since a passage of gas is closed in this structure, a stable flow can be created even if any kind of obstacle exists in an outside the apparatus for displaying the flying object.</p>
<p id="P-00080" num="00080">When there is a flow of rotation in the flying space <b>25</b>, flight itself of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> becomes unstable. Therefore, it is necessary to set honeycomb rectifier grids etc. in a honeycomb shape in an upstream side in the flying space. When an axial flow blower in a double reverse method or an axial flow blower with a static wing is used as the blower <b>11</b>, a flow of a direction component of rotation is very little in a blowing flow. Therefore, it is possible to provide the flying space <b>25</b> in which the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can fly stably without setting rectifier grids specially.</p>
<p id="P-00081" num="00081">By setting the flower <b>100</b> in the duct <b>20</b> in the apparatus for displaying the flying object according to this embodiment, it is possible to compose a scene as if the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> imitating a creature, e.g., butterfly plays around the flower. Further, by making the flower <b>100</b> controllable using an external signal or based on a determined sequence the same as the lightweight flying object <b>30</b>, a lean and a direction of the flower <b>100</b> can be changed. Accordingly, the entertainment effect can be improved.</p>

In this case, the guide unit <b>50</b> is fixed or can be operated back and forth or vertically. Further, it is not necessary that all of the guide units <b>50</b> are set at a same height on a side surface of the duct. Further, the guide units <b>50</b> can be set on both the side surface and the bottom. Other composition is same as FIG. <b>1</b>. Since explanations have been made in Embodiment 1, the explanations are omitted.</p>
<p id="P-00085" num="00085">In this embodiment, the top of the guide unit <b>50</b> is set as a fulcrum, and the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can start flying from the fulcrum. Therefore, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can move to the middle of the air flow <b>15</b> in the duct <b>20</b> using the guide unit <b>50</b>, and take off from the middle of the air flow <b>15</b>. Hence, it becomes possible to fly smoothly. Further, at takeoff, the guide unit <b>50</b> is extended, and after transition to flying, the guide unit <b>50</b> is shortened, or the guide unit <b>50</b> is moved down or up. Accordingly, the flying space <b>25</b> of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can be increased. Further, when the guide unit <b>50</b> is extended from the side surface toward the front, the viewers who look at the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> in the apparatus for displaying the flying object from the front are less conscious of the guide unit <b>50</b> and the holding line <b>40</b> compared with a case in which the guide unit <b>50</b> is extended from the bottom.

<p id="P-00100" num="heading-00100">Embodiment 6.</p>
<p id="P-00101" num="00101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates this embodiment.</p>
<p id="P-00102" num="00102">In the apparatus for displaying the flying object illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, same numbers are used for same devices which are illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>. Since the same devices have been explained earlier, explanations are omitted. In this embodiment, the drawing side and the blowing side of the group <b>10</b> of blowers are not linked to the duct <b>20</b>, and the apparatus for displaying the flying object is an open type. The group <b>10</b> of blowers is set in the upstream side of the flying space <b>25</b>. In this structure, it is not necessary to set the group <b>10</b> of blowers behind the duct <b>20</b>. Therefore, there is an advantage of reducing a size of the apparatus for displaying the flying object.</p>
<p id="P-00103" num="00103">For making the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> fly stably by a limited number of blowers <b>11</b>, it is necessary to rectify the flow by providing rectifier grids and a rectifier net in the blowing side of the group <b>10</b> of blowers. However, for setting the apparatus for displaying the flying object in a limited space, it is desirable to reduce a length in a flowing direction. Therefore, a method for setting the group <b>10</b> of blowers appropriately for stabilizing the flight of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is explained in the following.</p>
<p id="P-00104" num="00104">In this example, the double reverse blower is used as the blower <b>11</b>. The blower <b>11</b> has a clockwise rotary fan which is not illustrated behind a counterclockwise rotary fan which is illustrated in FIG. <b>6</b>. The group <b>10</b> of blowers has four blowers <b>11</b>. Among four blowers <b>11</b>, two inner blowers are placed lower than two outer blowers. Looking from a blowing direction of the group <b>10</b> of blowers, the blowers <b>11</b> are arranged in a shape of an inverted trapezoid.</p>
<p id="P-00105" num="00105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates velocity contour lines <b>12</b> for showing distribution of velocity of flow in an axial direction of the airframe, blown from the group <b>10</b> of blowers arranged in the shape of the inverted trapezoid. In the flows blown from each of the blowers <b>11</b>, velocity of each of flows <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b> is most rapid. The flows <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b> are also arranged in the shape of the inverted trapezoid.</p>
<p id="P-00106" num="00106">Next, a case in which the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> leans from a neutral position toward a left side and exists in a position <b>35</b> of leaning toward the left side is assumed. In a normal aircraft, when the airframe leans, a sideslip is caused toward the leaning direction. Synthesis velocity of sideslip velocity and main velocity acts on a leaned wing and increases the lift. Then, the airframe restores a stable state by moment in a direction of restoring from leaned position. Since movement of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is restricted by the holding line <b>40</b>, the velocity of sideslip due to leaning of the airframe is low. Hence, moment for restoring is also low. When the blowing flow is in the shape of the inverted trapezoid, the velocity which acts on the leaned wing is increased. Hence, when the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> leans toward the left side, large moment <b>36</b> for restoring is produced. By the moment for restoring, the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can return to a stable position easily. When the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> leans toward the right side and exists in a position <b>37</b> of leaning toward the right side, moment <b>38</b> for restoring is also produced, and the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> can return to a stable position.</p>
<p id="P-00107" num="00107">Arrangement of the group <b>10</b> of blowers in the shape of the inverted trapezoid has been explained for a case of the apparatus for displaying the flying object in the open type. However, same effect can be realized in the apparatus for displaying the flying object in a closed type, in which the duct is linked to the drawing side and the blowing side of the blower as illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00108" num="00108">As stated, the group <b>10</b> of blowers includes three or four blowers <b>11</b>. The inner blower <b>11</b> is placed lower than the outer blowers. Accordingly, a sectional shape of the flow from the group <b>10</b> of the blowers is in a shape of a valley with a low middle part and high left and right side parts. Therefore, when the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> is flied in the bottom of the valley, the stability of the flying attitude in the horizontal direction can be increased.</p>
<p id="P-00109" num="00109">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the air holes <b>130</b> are provided on the side surface and an upper surface of the duct <b>20</b>. The air flow <b>15</b> in the duct <b>20</b> comes in or out through the air holes <b>130</b>. It is possible to send the air flow <b>15</b> constantly or temporally into the duct <b>20</b> through the air hole <b>130</b>. It is also possible that the air hole <b>130</b> can be opened and closed. Besides the air hole <b>130</b> on the side surface and the upper surface of the duct <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the air hole <b>130</b> can be provided on the bottom of the duct <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00110" num="00110">Accordingly, since the air flow <b>15</b>, etc. comes in or out through the air hole <b>130</b> in the duct <b>20</b>, it is possible to add variations to the air flow <b>15</b> in the duct <b>20</b>. Therefore, it becomes possible to add variations to the flight of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00111" num="heading-00111">Embodiment 7.</p>
<p id="P-00112" num="00112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates this embodiment.</p>
<p id="P-00113" num="00113">In the apparatus for displaying the flying object illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a partition <b>160</b> for dividing the space of the duct <b>20</b> into a plurality of sub-spaces is added to the devices included in FIG. <b>6</b>. Other composition besides the partition is same as FIG. <b>6</b>. Therefore, explanations are omitted.</p>
<p id="P-00114" num="00114">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, by dividing the space in the duct <b>20</b> into a plurality of sub-spaces by the partition <b>160</b>, it becomes possible to change the air flow <b>15</b> created in each of the sub-spaces respectively for each of the subspaces using the group <b>10</b> of blowers and the air hole <b>130</b>, etc. which is not illustrated. Hence, when the lightweight flying objects exist in each of the spaces divided by each of the partitions <b>160</b>, it is possible to move each of the lightweight flying objects <b>30</b> separately. Therefore, the viewers can enjoy completely different flight by each of the lightweight flying objects <b>30</b>. Further, by making the partition <b>160</b> with transparent glass or plastic, the viewers become unconscious of the partition <b>160</b>. In this case, the viewers can enjoy the various flight of the lightweight flying object <b>30</b> without noticing mechanism of the partition <b>160</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to provide the apparatus for displaying the flying object which can attract the viewers even more.</p>
<p id="P-00115" num="00115">Further, a story is painted as a background on a wall in a front side of the partition <b>160</b>, and the partition <b>160</b> can be operated vertically or structured like bellows which can be folded. Accordingly, it becomes possible to make the plurality of lightweight flying objects <b>30</b> enter or leave by placing or withdrawing one partition <b>160</b>. For example, in Christmas season, a reindeer in a sub-space in a first row from the front, Santa Claus in a subspace in a second row, and a lot of snow in a sub-space in a third row, which are the lightweight flying objects <b>30</b>, are entered or left, and it is possible to add story characteristics to the apparatus for displaying the flying object. Hence, it becomes possible to attract the viewers more and display suitably for seasons and situations.</p>
<p id="P-00116" num="00116">In this embodiment, the flying object can fly variously.</p>
<p id="P-00117" num="00117">In this embodiment, since the flying object is restricted by the line, it is possible to make the flying object fly in a small space in the duct.</p>
<p id="P-00118" num="00118">In this embodiment, the load of the wing surface can be reduced by using lightweight paper or a frame of which strength per weight is high, and the stability of flight of the flying object can be increased. Further, the minimum flying velocity can be lowered.</p>
<p id="P-00119" num="00119">In this embodiment, the altitude of the flying object and the flying attitude can be changed by the external signal.</p>
<p id="P-00120" num="00120">In this embodiment, the flying object can fly in reacting to the music and lighting.</p>
<p id="P-00121" num="00121">In this embodiment, when the flying object flies, it is possible to increase the stability of the flying attitude in the horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="P-00122" num="00122">In this embodiment, since the flow component of rotation is little in the flows from the group of blowers, it is possible to prevent the flying attitude of the flying object from being disordered.</p>
<p id="P-00123" num="00123">In this embodiment, in the initial stage of flight sequence, the flying object moves to a middle part of the flow in the duct using the fulcrum, and the flying object can take off easily.</p>
<p id="P-00124" num="00124">In this embodiment, since the air flow is circulated in the duct, the stable air flow can be created even if the apparatus for displaying the flying object is surrounded by another device.</p>
<p id="P-00125" num="00125">In this embodiment, a circulating part is not necessary. Therefore, a size of the apparatus for displaying the flying object as a whole can be reduced.</p>
<p id="P-00126" num="00126">In this embodiment, it becomes possible to add variations to the flight of the flying object.</p>
<p id="P-00127" num="00127">Having thus described several particular embodiments of the invention, various alterations, modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and improvements are intended to be part of this disclosure, and are intended to be within the spirit and scope of the invention.

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">An apparatus for creating a list includes a planar base member and a plurality of magnetic items that are detachable apart from the base member. The desired magnetic items form the items to be included on the list and they are selected from amongst the plurality of magnetic items and are placed proximate the base member. The base member and the desired magnetic items are used as a portable list or, alternatively, a piece of paper is placed over the magnetic items and a force is applied to the surface of the paper, for example rubbing it with the side of a pencil, which affects the paper to transfer a legible representation of the magnetic items to the paper. The paper is then used as the portable list.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e408" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention, in general relates to grocery lists and the like and, more particularly, to magnetic lists.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">People frequently use lists when shopping. For example, it is common to make a grocery list and then take that list to the supermarket to use, checking off items once they have been placed in the shopping cart. When shopping in department stores or running assorted errands, people often rely upon lists to ensure that nothing is overlooked.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Even though lists are especially useful, people still sometimes fail to use them when they might be of advantage because making and updating a list itself takes time. For example, when most of the items on a list have been obtained, but not every item, the list to some degree becomes obsolete.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">This is because people generally do not see much value in having (i.e., carrying) a list that contains only one item on it, for example. While it is reasonable to expect people to carry over any remaining items from an older list forward to a new list, people often don't bother doing so and, consequently, the remaining items from the old list risk being overlooked.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">It is desirable to facilitate the creation of shopping lists and to make as easy as possible the ability to update those lists.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">Furthermore, certain types of stores may wish to provide their customers with a list that is tailored to the items that their particular store markets. For example, a wholesale type of a store might wish to provide customers with a list that contains the generic item types found in that store as a means to promote shopping there.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">A brand name type of a cereal manufacturer might provide a shopping list in the cereal container that includes, as one possible item for inclusion on the list, the brand name of that particular cereal as well as the brand names of other cereals that are made by that company.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Accordingly there exists today a need for a product and method that facilitates the formation of a list.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">Clearly, such an apparatus and method would be useful and desirable.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">Lists are, in general, known. While the structural arrangements of the above described devices, at first appearance, may have similarities with the present invention, they differ in material respects. These differences, which will be described in more detail hereinafter, are essential for the effective use of the invention and which admit of the advantages that are not available with the prior devices.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e473" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">It is an object of the present invention to provide a magnetic list that is inexpensive to manufacture.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">It is also an important object of the invention to provide a magnetic list that can be used for sales promotion purposes.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Another object of the invention is to provide a magnetic list that can be taken when shopping.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">Still another object of the invention is to provide a magnetic list that can remain at one location and be used to create a second list that is readily transportable.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">Still yet another object of the invention is to provide a magnetic list that can include items that appertain to the products or services of a particular company.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">Yet another important object of the invention is to provide a magnetic list that can be tailored to ethnic interests.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">Still yet another important object of the invention is to provide a magnetic list that uses icons to identify products.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">One further object of the invention is to provide a magnetic list that includes words (i.e., letters) to identify products.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">One still further object of the invention is to provide a magnetic list that includes raised or recessed letters to identify products.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">One still further important object of the invention is to provide a magnetic list that includes an ornamental representation that agrees with the theme of products and services offered by the company.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">Briefly, a magnetic list that is constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention has a planar base member and a plurality of magnetic items that are detachable apart from the base member. A list is formed by placing the desired magnetic items proximate the base member. The base member and magnetic items can then be taken as a portable list or, alternatively, a piece of paper can be placed over the magnetic items and by applying a force over the paper, such as rubbing it with the side of a pencil, a legible representation of the magnetic items is transferred to the paper which is then used as the portable list.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e566" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown, a grocery list, identified in general by the reference numeral <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">The grocery list <b>10</b> includes a planar base <b>12</b> that preferably is ornamental with a theme that suggests its use (i.e., for groceries). As shown the planar base <b>12</b> has the appearance of a grocery bag with items sticking out of the top, although other representations could be shown, for example, instead of a bag a grocery store type of a shopping cart (not shown) or other design could be used.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">The planar base <b>12</b> is preferably formed of a flexible magnetic material and is placed on a refrigerator (not shown) or the like. Alternately, the planar base <b>12</b> can be attached with VELCRO or by any suitable detachable method.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">A plurality of individual magnetic items <b>14</b> are shown on the planar base <b>12</b> that include the names of the desired types of items printed thereon, preferably with either raised or recessed lettering.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">Also shown, is a pictorial magnetic item <b>16</b> that shows a coffee cup and is used to remind the shopper to obtain coffee. The pictorial magnetic item <b>16</b> is an icon and, preferably, includes either a raised or a recessed image.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">The magnetic items <b>14</b> and the pictorial magnetic item <b>16</b> (or items) that are desired are placed on the planar base <b>12</b> to which they adhere magnetically, because the planar base <b>12</b> either attracts them because it too is magnetic or it must alternatively include a ferrous material.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">Other magnetic items <b>14</b> and pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b> are included with the grocery list <b>10</b> (or can be purchased later). These are placed aside the grocery list <b>10</b> and, when they are to be included in the grocery list <b>10</b>, they are lifted and placed on the planar base <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">In use the grocery list <b>10</b> is removed from the refrigerator and taken shopping. As the actual items (not shown) are obtained, the magnetic items <b>14</b> and pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b> can be removed from the top of the grocery list <b>10</b>, for example, and placed at the bottom or back of the base <b>12</b> to indicate that they have been obtained.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">If either raised or recessed letters of images are used with the magnetic items <b>14</b> or pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b>, a piece of paper <b>18</b> can be temporarily placed and held over the grocery list <b>10</b> and a force can be applied to the top of the paper <b>18</b> such as rubbing it with a lead point <b>19</b> of a pencil <b>20</b> that is moved side to side.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">This will transcribe the desired items (either the magnetic items <b>14</b> or the pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b> or both) to the paper <b>18</b> by creating a darkened pencil image of raised letters or images on a lighter pencil background that is legible and sufficient to rapidly create a second portable list on the paper <b>18</b>. If the letters or images are recessed, they will appear lighter than the background.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">When the shopper returns home, the items that were obtained are removed off of the planar base <b>12</b> and the remaining items still needing to be acquired are left on the planar base <b>12</b>. Other items that are needed are added for use in readily generating another current paper type of a list or the entire grocery list <b>10</b> can be taken.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">While the paper <b>18</b> as shown is small and only covers a portion of the items <b>14</b>, a larger piece of paper can, of course, be used to transcribe the entire grocery list <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">The use of a smaller piece of paper <b>18</b> allows for a user to make the second portable list that includes only selected items from the grocery list <b>10</b>. To do this the paper <b>18</b> is placed over the selected items and the pencil <b>20</b> is rubbed only upon the selected items.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">This is useful if the shopper is going to go to a convenience store (instead of a supermarket) and only wishes to obtain a few of the most important items.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">The magnetic items <b>14</b> or the pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b> could include specific brand names of products. If desired, the manufacturer of the brand name product could include such a list along with their products. They might well include the brand names of every product that they produce as possible magnetic items <b>14</b> or as possible pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b> (if there is a logo or other brand name identification present) while only including generic names of other products.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">This is useful to promote sales of their particular products, instead of generic products. For example, a manufacturer of cereal would not want to say cereal but rather to say the specific brand names of the cereals that they produce. If the list (or second portable list) is then given to another person, they are almost certain to obtain the brand name item rather than a generic cereal, for example.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">Also, the companies that provide such types of lists may in fact include the brand names of products that they do not produce when these products do not compete with their own product lines. This may be done when cross-agreements with other manufactures reciprocate the favor or if the other manufacturers pay them to do so (as another form of advertising).</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is shown a modified base <b>50</b> that preferably includes an ornamental representation of the desired theme. In the illustration, the modified base <b>50</b> includes a picture of a shopping cart <b>51</b>, of the type that is commonly used in wholesale warehouse types of stores.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">The user places all desired items <b>52</b> that correspond with the items offered for sale on the image of the cart on the modified base <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">This illustrates how different types of stores can offer such a type of a list for their customers to use when shopping at that store. The modified base <b>50</b> and shopping list is used in a manner similar to the grocery list <b>10</b> as was described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">Name brands of products they sell could be included as the individual items <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">Other modifications are possible for the instant invention. For example, the various magnetic items <b>14</b> or the pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b> may be included as part of the base <b>12</b>. When they are separated from the base <b>12</b>, a hole is formed in the base where the magnetic items <b>14</b> or the pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b> were located. The refrigerator (for example) would be underneath. The desired magnetic items <b>14</b> or the pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b> are then placed in the hole in the base <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">However, in this instance the paper <b>18</b> must be used to form a second portable list because if the base <b>12</b> were removed from the refrigerator, the magnetic items <b>14</b> and the pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b> would remain behind attached to the refrigerator.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">The magnetic items <b>14</b> and the pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b> can also be tailored to match various ethnic preferences. For example, a Mexican version could include popular Mexican foodstuffs.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">The magnetic items <b>14</b> and the pictorial magnetic items <b>16</b> can also be tailored to include various preferences within a given product line. For example, a list of beers (not shown) can include different generic as well as different brand name beers, including light beers, dark beers, lagers, etc.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">The invention has been shown, described, and illustrated in substantial detail with reference to the presently preferred embodiment. It will be understood by those skilled in this art that other and further changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which is defined by the claims appended hereto.</p>

<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention relates generally to an arrangement based in principle on utilising a magnetic attractive force when it becomes operative between two permanently magnetised or magnetic strips.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">More specifically the present invention relates to an arrangement enabling edge-to-edge joining or holding together, by means of a magnetic attractive force, of a first edge portion of a first panel in a display system to or against an opposed or second edge portion of a second panel.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">The arrangement in accordance with the invention is also based on the principle of a first magnetised strip being applied to said first edge portion and a second magnetised strip being applied to said second edge portion, the edge-oriented magnetised strips being assigned such magnetisation directions that, in a position where the edge portions are in proximity and/or co-operating with each other, they assume a position strongly attracted to each other.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">The principle of the invention is also based on said magnetised or magnetic strips consisting of a material or a material composition different from the material or material composition of the panel.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">This choice of materials for the strip and for the panel requires the use of a means attaching the strip to the panel, said means being oriented close to said edge portions.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Said attachment means usually consists of an adhesive layer applied on the strip.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The present invention has been developed for the purpose of obtaining an application in a folding display arrangement or a display system comprising several panels.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">Such a display arrangement may advantageously comprise of a plurality of base units that can be placed on, attached to or rest against a support surface, a sheet or panel that can be rolled or unrolled and may display a text, and/or pertain to each base unit, and a stand designed to support and retain the sheet or panel.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">The expression &#x201c;sheet or panel&#x201d; refers primarily to a surface displaying a picture and/or text applied on a screen, a sheet of PVC or paper or other equivalent, thin carrier, the sheet material being so thin and thus flexible that it can be rolled and unrolled without the rolling or unrolling causing disturbing permanent deformation when unrolled to assume the form of a flat sheet or panel.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">Only &#x201c;panel&#x201d; is used in the following description and this expression shall be understood in the first place to mean a thin sheet, without entirely excluding somewhat thicker and stiffer panels.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">The invention also makes reference to a magnetic strip arrangement, which is adapted to co-operate with said panel or similar object in other applications.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e850" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">Several different arrangements are already known for joining sheets or panels edge-to-edge in a display system or arrangement by utilising a magnetic attractive force.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">Several ways of combining pictures and text having dimensions considerably larger than the dimensions of a single utilised sheet or panel, for the purpose of providing information are already known and, with reference to the present invention, it should be mentioned that it is already known to join a plurality of such panels edge-to-edge with the aid of magnetised strip arrangements initiating the requisite magnetic attractive forces towards each other.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">More specifically it is in this respect known for a first edge portion of a first panel to be detachably joined to a second edge portion of a second panel, a first permanently magnetised strip being applied to said first edge portion and a second permanently magnetised strip being applied to said second edge portion, and the magnetised strips being assigned such magnetisation directions in relation to each other that, in a position where the edge portions are in proximity and/or co-operating with each other, they assume a position firmly attracted to each other, said strips consisting of a composite material different from the material of the panels or the sheets and with the strips attached by means of adhesive to said edge portions of the panel.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">In this connection it is known to use a PVC material for the material of the panel, which has a modulus of elasticity of approximately 2600 MPa (megapascal or N/m<sup>2</sup>) and to use an elastic plastic material for the magnetised strip or magnetic strip (1.7&#xd7;6 mm), which has a modulus of elasticity of approximately 30-35 MPa.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">In this respect the magnetic strips pertaining to the panel are suited for mechanical and magnetic co-operation with rails or support points located behind them which are also assigned permanent magnetisation or a magnetically attracting metal</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">In connection with this arrangement it is thus already known to utilise permanently magnetised strips having a thickness dimension lying usually within the range of about 1.5 to 2.0 mm and having a width dimension between approximately 6 and 12 mm.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">These permanently magnetised strips may be polarised in sections 1.5 mm wide or may be N-S polarised in the transverse direction.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">It is already known that when a panel is to be rolled up, if one or both lengthways edge portions have been provided with magnetised strips of such thickness, the inner rolling radius for the panel must be rather large so that tensile and compressive forces, as well as axial stress related forces in the edge portions of the panel and the magnetised strip and the attachment means used, will not cause such high stresses that plastic deformation occurs or that the attachment means used slips or is released from its attachment to the panel.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">It is also obvious that the spiral shape produced when the panel is rolled up acquires a pitch which is at least dependent on the thickness of the strip and of the panel. Thin panels in particular are extremely difficult to handle when fully rolled up since they become heavy at the end or edge due to the weight of the magnetic strips.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">It is also known per se that a maximised magnetic attractive force between the edge portions of the panels must be sufficiently strong to cause these edge portions to abut each other tightly even in the event of slight forces being exerted on the exposed surfaces of the panels.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">The magnetic attractive force necessary for this is well tested and thus known.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">Taking into consideration the specifics associated with the present invention it may also be mentioned that it is known per se to apply relatively thick magnetic strips (e.g. 1.5-2.0 mm) to the laterally oriented edge portions of one or more sheets or panels so that adjacent sheets can be aligned edge-to-edge without, or substantially without any obvious join between the sheets and where the magnetic attractive force is developed between N/S and S/N magnetised magnetic strips in the transverse direction. Magnetic strips having a thickness of 1.5 to 2.0 mm and a width of 6-12 mm can thus act towards each other edge-to-edge or end surface to end surface.</p>

<p id="P-00026" num="heading-00026">Account of the Present Invention</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="heading-00027">Technical Problems</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">Taking into consideration the fact that the technical deliberations one skilled in the art must perform in order to offer a solution to one or more of the technical problems posed are initially an insight into the measures and/or the sequence of measures to be taken and a choice of the means required, and on the basis thereof, the following technical problems are no doubt relevant when producing the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Taking into consideration the state of the art, as described above, it should be deemed a technical problem in an arrangement enabling edge-to-edge joining, by means of a magnetic attractive force, of a first edge portion of a first panel in a display system to a second edge portion of a second panel, to be able to create such prerequisites that a panel with magnetised strips applied to one edge portion or both edge portions can be rolled in a tight spiral to cylindrical shape (substantially cylindrical shape) having a considerably smaller least diameter than that offered in previously known panels having magnetised strips applied on one edge portion or both edge portions and which shall be rolled up or unrolled from this cylindrical shape to produce a flat orientation.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">A technical problem also exists in being able to create such prerequisites that the pitch for spirally rolling the panel with magnetised strips applied, to cylindrical shape, can be chosen considerably less than has been previously possible.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">It is furthermore a technical problem to be able to create such prerequisites that a panel with edge-related magnetised strips or thin magnetic strips can be rolled onto a roller-blind rod or rolled up for transportation without a rod but with a relatively small least diameter, e.g. about 10-30 mm.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">A technical problem is also entailed in being able to perceive the significance of and advantages associated with, utilising thin magnetic strips, still being able to create prerequisites for sufficiently high magnetic attractive force between the edge portions of the panels and/or the edge surfaces of adjacent magnetic strips, which high attractive force can join with or somewhat exceed the attractive force that the end portions of thick magnetic strips are known to be able to offer.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">A technical problem is also entailed in being able to create such prerequisites that, when said magnetised strips consist of a material different from the material of the panel, conditions shall be created in a attachment means or a layer for relatively low axial stress, in spite of a small radius of curvature having been selected for the panel on which the magnetised strip or strips is/are applied.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">A technical problem is also entailed in being able to perceive the significance of and advantages associated with choosing the modulus of elasticity and the thickness of the material in said panel and the modulus of elasticity and the thickness of the material in said permanently magnetised strips in relation to each other so that axial stress appearing will be small or non-existent for the forces that will act within the area of the attachment means or the layer.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">A technical problem is also entailed in being able to perceive the significance of and advantages associated with, in a panel of previously known type suitable for a display system, being able to create such prerequisites that the permanently magnetised strips can be thin and in any case assigned a thickness of less than 1.0 mm.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">A technical problem is also entailed in being able to perceive the significance of and advantages associated with selecting the thickness of the permanently magnetised strip as 0.2-0.8 mm, preferably 0.6-0.75, e.g. about 0.7 mm.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">It should also be deemed a technical problem to be able to create a magnetic strip from a resilient plastic material or plastic compound having a modulus of elasticity exceeding 60 MPa and normally less than 200 MPa, where the magnetic field strength is generated by a magnetised granular material of the metal neodymium or equivalent.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">A technical problem is also entailed in being able to perceive the significance of and advantages associated with selecting the magnetisation direction of the strip N-S in the thickness or transverse direction of the strip.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">A technical problem is also entailed in being able to perceive the significance of and advantages associated with choosing the same magnetisation direction along the whole length of the strip.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">A technical problem is also entailed in being able to perceive the significance of and advantages associated with said strip, independently of its use, consisting of a strongly magnetic section and a non-magnetic section, and with an adhesive means extending over these two sections.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">A technical problem is also entailed in being able to perceive the significance of and advantages associated with allowing the magnetic section to be strip-edge-related and arranged to offer sufficient magnetic attractive force, which can be achieved by the magnetised section covering less than &#x2153; of the width of the strip.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">A technical problem is also entailed in being able to perceive the significance of and advantages associated with choosing the magnetic section to be greater than 10% of the width of the strip.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">A technical problem is also entailed in being able to perceive the significance of and advantages associated with allowing a first strip magnetised in N-S direction to be assigned a colour deviating from the colour of the second strip magnetised in S-N direction.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="heading-00044">Solution</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">The present invention is based on an arrangement enabling edge-to-edge joining, by means of a magnetic attractive force, of a first edge portion of a first panel in a display system to a second edge portion of a second panel, a first magnetised strip being applied to said first edge portion and a second magnetised strip being applied to said second edge portion, the magnetised strips being assigned such magnetisation directions that, in a position where the edge portions are in proximity and/or co-operating with each other, they assume a position attracted to each other, and said strips consisting of a material different from the material of the panel and with means attaching the strip to the panel attached close to said edge portions.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">In such an arrangement, specifically to solve one or more of the technical problems listed above, the present invention advocates that the modulus of elasticity and the thickness of said panel and the modulus of elasticity and the thickness of said strips shall be such in relation to each other that only small axial stress related forces, or none at all, will act within said attachment means, and that said strips shall be assigned a thickness suitable for this purpose that shall in any case be less than 1.0 mm.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">As proposed embodiments falling within the scope of the present invention it is recommended that the modulus of elasticity for said panel may be selected for a plastic material within the range of 2000 to 3500 MPa and/or that the modulus of elasticity for said magnetic strips may be selected within the range of 60-200 MPa.</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">The present invention also advocates that the thickness of the strip may be selected as 0.2-0.8 mm and contain magnetic granular material of the metal neodymium.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">Particularly recommended is for the magnetisation of one strip to be selected N-S in the transverse direction and for the same magnetisation direction to be chosen along the whole length of the strip.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">The invention further recommends, independently of the application mentioned above, that said magnetic strip shall consist of a first magnetic section and a second non-magnetic section, the magnetic section may in the application referred to above be strip-edge-related.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">The strip arrangement having two sections may be designed to cover less than &#x2153; of the width of the strip.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">The invention recommends that, when neodymium magnets are used, the magnetic section shall be chosen greater than 10% of the width of the strip.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">The invention recommends assigning different colours for the first magnetised strip and the second magnetised strip.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">It is also recommended that the attachment means used shall consist of an adhesive layer covering said section.</p>
<p id="P-00055" num="heading-00055">Advantages</p>
<p id="P-00056" num="00056">The advantages that may primarily be deemed to characterise an arrangement in accordance with the present invention are that prerequisites are thereby created to assign a panel in a display system a rolled-up state wherein the radius of curvature can be chosen considerably smaller than the radius of curvature applicable for conventional rollable panels and wherein a modulus of elasticity and a thickness of said panel and a modulus of elasticity and a thickness of the magnetised strip or strips are such in relation to each other that only small axial stress related forces, or none at all, will act within said attachment means used.</p>
<p id="P-00057" num="00057">It is furthermore advocated that the magnetised strip should be assigned a thickness which, at least in normal cases, shall be less than 1.0 mm.</p>
<p id="P-00058" num="00058">Furthermore a strip arrangement having two sections may be used and the cost for the production of such a magnetic strip is less than for a full magnetic strip arrangement yet the adhesive attachment force may be the same.</p>
<p id="P-00059" num="00059">The features primarily considered characteristic of an arrangement in accordance with the present invention are specified in the characterising part of claim <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="P-00074" num="00074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the distribution of the axial stress forces when the panel <b>1</b>, with a magnetised strip <b>2</b> applied, is bent convexly with the panel <b>1</b> on the outside.</p>
<p id="P-00075" num="00075">Since the panel <b>1</b> consists of a material, a screen, a sheet of PVC, a paper or other relatively stiff material, having a modulus of elasticity that, in accordance with the invention, shall fall within the range of 2000 to 3500 MPa which far exceeds the modulus of elasticity of 60-200 MPa for the magnetised strip <b>2</b> produced from a composite, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is intended to illustrate that the neutral layer, designated <b>2</b><i>b</i>, has been displaced towards the lower surface <b>1</b>&#x2032; of the panel <b>1</b>. This surface <b>1</b>&#x2032; co-operates, via an adhesive layer <b>3</b>, with an upper surface <b>2</b>&#x2032; assigned to the magnetised strip <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00076" num="00076">For one skilled in the areas of design calculations and strength of materials calculations it is known to mathematically evaluate the neutral layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>where axial stress related forces are zero or close to zero.</p>
<p id="P-00077" num="00077">With the large differences in modulus of elasticity in question here, e.g. 2000-3500 MPa for the panel <b>1</b> and 60-200 MPa for the magnetic strip <b>2</b>, an appropriate slight displacement of the neutral layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>occurs towards the adhesive layer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00078" num="00078">The magnetised strip shall still be chosen from a soft, resilient material (small modulus of elasticity) and although the limit values stated, 60-200 MPa, are considerably larger than the known modulus of elasticity (33 MPa), it is probably suitable to select a modulus of elasticity of between 80 and 150 MPa, e.g. 90-120 MPa.</p>
<p id="P-00079" num="00079">It is also obvious that the absolute magnitude of the axial stress forces stated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is dependent on the magnitude of the moment, to which it is submitted, i.e. on the radius of curvature when the panel is rolled.</p>
<p id="P-00080" num="00080">The transverse force here can be theoretically neglected with constant bending or radius of curvature since no shear stresses occur in this application.</p>
<p id="P-00081" num="00081">It should also be noted that any force acting within the adhesive layer <b>3</b> can cause the magnetic strip <b>2</b> to be displaced in relation to the panel <b>1</b>, or vice versa, resulting in considerable difficulty when the panel is to assume a flat state in which the magnetic strip <b>2</b> and panel <b>1</b> must resume the state in which they are able to expose their message.</p>
<p id="P-00082" num="00082">Of significance to the present invention is thus the insight that a neutral layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>for a specific case of bending will, upon a selected increase in modulus of elasticity for the panel <b>1</b> in relation to the modulus of elasticity of the magnetised strip <b>2</b>, be displaced towards the limit surfaces <b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>2</b>&#x2032; and that the closer the neutral layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>will be to the adhesive layer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00083" num="00083">The present invention thus offers an arrangement &#x201c;A&#x201d; based on a well-balanced co-ordination between the modulus of elasticity and thickness (2600 MPa; 0.2 mm) of the panel <b>1</b> and the modulus of elasticity and thickness (150 MPa; 0.7 mm) of the magnetised strip <b>2</b> in order, by observance of these factors, to cause forces occurring in the layer <b>3</b> to be selected to 0 or at least close to 0.</p>
<p id="P-00084" num="00084">Thanks to this dimensioning rule axial stress related forces in the layer <b>3</b> will be slight.</p>
<p id="P-00085" num="00085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show a general arrangement enabling edge-to-edge joining, by means of a magnetic attractive force, of a first edge portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of a first panel <b>11</b> in a display system <b>10</b> to a second edge portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>of a second panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00086" num="00086">A first magnetised strip <b>11</b><i>e </i>is applied on said first edge portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>and a second magnetised strip <b>12</b><i>d </i>is applied on said second edge portion <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The magnetised strips are assigned such magnetisation directions in relation to each other that, in a position not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> but intimated, where the edge portions are in proximity and/or in co-operation with each other they are able to assume a position where they are maximally attracted to each other and fixed in relation to each other.</p>
<p id="P-00087" num="00087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is intended to show that a panel <b>11</b> (or <b>12</b>) that has been rolled up to a spiral about a roller-blind rod situated below in a base part, and has been stored in this rolled-up state for an extended period of time, can be unrolled and secured to the upper part of a stand, thereby producing a flat surface.</p>
<p id="P-00088" num="00088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is intended to show that a panel <b>11</b> that has been rolled up to a spiral as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and has been stored in this rolled-up state for an extended period of time, can be secured to the upper part of a stand and be allowed to drop down and be secured to a base part, thereby producing a flat surface.</p>
<p id="P-00089" num="00089">Said strips <b>11</b><i>e</i>, <b>12</b><i>d </i>here consist of a composite material containing plastic and the properties of this material can be adjusted to requirements set, as well as being different from the material of the panel and its properties, and with attachment means pertaining to the strip secured close to said edge portions of the panels <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="P-00090" num="00090">The description of these fixing media, which may have an application different from the technical field mentioned above, is specified in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> where said magnetised strip <b>11</b><i>e </i>is secured to one edge portion of the panel <b>11</b> and said magnetised strip <b>12</b><i>d </i>is secured to the edge portion of said panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00091" num="00091">A fundamental condition of the present invention is that the modulus of elasticity and the thickness of said panels <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, respectively, and the modulus of elasticity and the thickness of said strips <b>11</b><i>e</i>, <b>12</b><i>d </i>are so adjusted in relation to each other as described above that only small axial stress related forces, or none at all, will act within said attachment means <b>3</b> or between the surface layers <b>1</b>&#x2032;, <b>2</b>&#x2032; shown in FIG. <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00092" num="00092">In order to fulfil the requirement of only small forces, or none at all, in the attachment means <b>3</b> and acceptable forces within the magnetised strip, the present invention also recommends that said strips <b>11</b><i>e</i>, <b>12</b><i>d </i>shall be assigned a small thickness &#x201c;d&#x201d; and in any case the thickness shall in practice be less than 1.0 mm.</p>
<p id="P-00093" num="00093">The thickness of the panel <b>11</b> is normally selected as thin as circumstances permit so as to enable satisfactory rolling, and in practice a thickness &#x201c;a&#x201d; of less than 0.2 mm should be feasible.</p>
<p id="P-00094" num="00094">A thickness of 0.1 is sufficient for many applications. However, the panel should be strong enough to withstand tearing.</p>
<p id="P-00095" num="00095">The ratio &#x201c;d/a&#x201d; is largely dependent on the modulus of elasticity selected for the panel and the magnetised strip. Ratios within the range 15:2 may be considered suitable, preferably between 5:6, e.g. 3:4.</p>
<p id="P-00096" num="00096">The thickness &#x201c;d&#x201d; of the magnetised strip <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, respectively shall be chosen as small as possible since the magnetic strips shall have sufficient maximised magnetic attractive force for the application in question.</p>
<p id="P-00097" num="00097">It may be mentioned here that the attractive force is dependent on the proportion of magnetised granular material mixed into a plastic compound. The attractive force can therefore be increased by increasing the proportion of granular material.</p>
<p id="P-00098" num="00098">In practice the thickness &#x201c;d&#x201d; may be chosen as 0.2-0.8 mm with a granular material containing neodymium magnets or the like.</p>
<p id="P-00099" num="00099">Values within the range 0.5-0.8, e.g. about 0.7 mm, have been found suitable in many practical applications.</p>
<p id="P-00100" num="00100">In accordance with the invention the magnetisation direction shall be selected S-N for the strip <b>11</b><i>e </i>and N-S for the strip <b>12</b><i>d</i>, enabling co-operation between the strips <b>11</b><i>e </i>and <b>12</b><i>d </i>to acquire a predetermined direction, ensuring that upper surfaces <b>11</b>&#x2032; and <b>12</b>&#x2032; of the panels <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, respectively, will be aligned with each other.</p>
<p id="P-00101" num="00101">The same magnetisation direction is chosen along the whole length of the strip, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="P-00102" num="00102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that said strip <b>11</b><i>e </i>shall consist of a homogenous, magnetised plastic material and comprise a unit with an adhesive surface <b>50</b> for adhesion to the lower surface <b>11</b>&#x2032; of the panel <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00103" num="00103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows that said strip, e.g. the strip <b>12</b><i>d</i>, may consist of a first, a homogenous magnetic, section <b>12</b><i>e </i>and a second, a non-magnetic section <b>12</b><i>f</i>, thereby reducing the costs of magnetisation and the magnetic material required while still retaining a sufficiently large adhesive area <b>51</b> to co-operate with the lower surface <b>12</b>&#x2032; of the panel <b>12</b>. A magnetic strip arrangement having three or more sections falls also within the inventive idea of the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00104" num="00104">It seems natural for the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to have one and the same modulus of elasticity across its entire cross section. However, measures may be required to fulfil this requirement for the embodiment according to FIG. <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00105" num="00105">These measures may entail different quantities of plasticizers to be added for the sections <b>12</b><i>e </i>and <b>12</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="P-00106" num="00106">The magnetic section <b>12</b><i>e </i>is strip-edge-related and designed to cover less than &#x2153; of the width &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the strip. It is preferably chosen to cover more than 10% of the width &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the strip.</p>
<p id="P-00107" num="00107">The first magnetised strip <b>11</b><i>e </i>is thus magnetised in a first edge-oriented direction S-N and the second magnetised strip <b>12</b><i>d </i>is magnetised in a second edge-oriented direction N-S and, to enable visual differentiation of said strips, it is recommended that they are assigned different colours so that a join between one edge portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of a first panel <b>11</b> and a second edge portion <b>12</b><i>b </i>of a second panel <b>12</b> can be created without misunderstanding.</p>
<p id="P-00108" num="00108">Although the attachment means <b>3</b> on the surfaces <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>, respectively, may advantageously consist of an adhesive layer covering said section, means other than an adhesive layer also fall within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="P-00109" num="00109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows in perspective a panel rolled maximally to a spiral and having a thickness of 0.2 mm, with magnetised strips 1.7 mm thick, and having a modulus of elasticity of 33 MPa.</p>
<p id="P-00110" num="00110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows in perspective a panel rolled maximally to a spiral and having a thickness of 0.2 mm, with magnetised strips designed in accordance with the invention 0.7 mm thick, and having a modulus of elasticity of 100 MPa.</p>
<p id="P-00111" num="00111">The invention thus recommends the ratio between the modulus of elasticity assigned to panel and strip to be adjusted in relation to each other to fulfil the ratios stated in the description and offer the technical effects associated with the invention.</p>
<p id="P-00112" num="00112">The values stated for modulus of elasticity relate primarily to plastic material and the principles of the invention can also be utilised for other materials, reinforced or not reinforced.</p>
<p id="P-00113" num="00113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the orientation of a neutral layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>when a plastic panel (PVC plastic) 0.2 mm thick and with a modulus of elasticity of 2600 MPa is bent together with a magnetic strip, assigned a thickness of 0.7 mm and with a modulus of elasticity of 150 MPa.</p>
<p id="P-00114" num="00114">It is now obvious that a higher modulus of elasticity (say 200 MPa) for the magnetic strip will raise the neutral plane <b>2</b><i>b</i>, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="P-00115" num="00115">A higher modulus of elasticity (say 3000 MPa) for the panel will also raise the neutral plane <b>2</b><i>b</i>, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="P-00116" num="00116">The magnetised strip in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can preferably be manufactured by extruding a plastic compound containing neodymium material through a nozzle and providing a magnetising unit in conjunction with the nozzle, inside or downstream thereof, to assign the neodymium material its magnetisation direction during the solidification process, which may include a cooling stretch.</p>
<p id="P-00117" num="00117">The magnetised strip in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is somewhat more complex. The section <b>12</b><i>e </i>can be manufactured as described above whereas the section <b>12</b><i>f </i>can be manufactured using conventional methods.</p>
<p id="P-00118" num="00118">The boundary layer <b>12</b><i>g</i>, however, must integrate the two sections <b>12</b><i>e</i>, <b>12</b><i>f </i>so that a homogenous magnetic strip is extruded.</p>
<p id="P-00119" num="00119">The invention is naturally not limited to the embodiment described above by way of example. It can be modified within the scope of the inventive concept illustrated in the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1109" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention refers to a safety device for a breechblock of a firearm, in particular suitable for limiting the possibility of accidental sliding of the breechblock following knocks.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1119" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">Hereafter, specific reference shall be made to a semi-automatic rifle, even though that which is object of the invention can be applied to other types of firearm. Moreover, given that the invention is intended for experts in the field of firearms, we leave out the detailed description of the structure and operation of a firearm, in particular of a rifle like the one described. We make reference only to the functions of the firearm parts involved in the technical problem forming the basis of the invention.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Following hard knocks to the rear part of the stock, such as those generated by the use of the firearm to knock over an obstacle, or in the case of the firearm itself being dropped, the breechblock could translate and move back until it is in open position, consequently causing the involuntary loss of a cartridge in the chamber or involuntarily feeding a cartridge.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Both situations involve a situation of high risk, above all if the user does not realise that a cartridge has involuntarily entered the chamber or that a shot has been missed.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Currently, safety devices for firearms prevent accidental firing of a shot in the barrel by intervening on the sear mechanism, in particular on the trigger or on the firing pin. However, the problem of accidental translation of the breechblock and its consequences on the accidental loading into the chamber or the loss of a cartridge are not tackled.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">A safety device for a breechblock should be able to intervene automatically when there is a state of risk and, on the other hand, remain in rest position the rest of the time.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">Indeed, a safety element, capable of being inserted and uninserted manually by the user, could be arranged or forgotten in the wrong position. Therefore, the user could find himself unable to fire because he has forgotten the safety inserted or dangerously handling the firearm without having inserted the safety.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1154" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">The purpose of the invention is to provide a safety device for a breechblock of a firearm which limits accidental sliding of a breechblock (<b>14</b>) caused by an impact to the firearm, said safety device comprising a locking lever (<b>15</b>) affixed to said breechblock (<b>14</b>) with the locking lever (<b>15</b>) being axially pivoted to the structure of the firearm to allow the locking lever (<b>15</b>) to rotate in axis (<b>11</b>), an elastic return element (<b>18</b>) connected to said locking lever (<b>15</b>), for keeping said locking lever (<b>15</b>) in a rest position during conditions of normal use of the firearm, said locking lever (<b>15</b>) being equipped with an engagement element (<b>19</b>) for engagement with a seat (<b>23</b>) of said breechblock (<b>14</b>) said locking lever (<b>15</b>) being affixed to said breechblock (<b>14</b>) to provide said locking lever (<b>15</b>) with a centre of gravity (G) which is offset with respect to the axis of rotation (<b>11</b>) of said locking lever (<b>15</b>), to cause inertial rotation of said locking lever (<b>15</b>) and engage said seat (<b>23</b>) when said firearm is subjected to an impact.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Another purpose of the present invention is that of realising a safety device for a breechblock which requires low maintenance and which is reliable over time so as not to risk compromising the operation of the entire firearm.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">Another purpose of the present invention is that of realising a safety device for a breechblock of a firearm which is particularly simple and functional, with low costs.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1366" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">The characteristics and advantages of a safety device for a breechblock according to the present invention shall become clearer from the following description, given as an example and not for limiting purposes, referring to the attached schematic drawings, in which: <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show a detail of a firearm, partially sectioned carrying a safety device for a breechblock, object of the present invention, represented in rest and engagement position, respectively; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view of the safety device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> applied to a front end of the structure; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show the detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> in which the safety device is sectioned along the middle plane.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">With reference to the figures a safety device for a breechblock of a firearm is shown as an example and not for limiting purposes, wholly indicated with <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">The firearm comprises a barrel <b>12</b>, of which only the axis is indicated, attached to a casing <b>13</b> and a breechblock carrier <b>14</b>, carrying a firing pin, which is not shown.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">The components of the firearm are only partially shown, because they are already known in their structure and operation.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">In particular, the breechblock <b>14</b> can be displaced in a known way from an advanced closing or firing position of the ammunition in the barrel to a set back position opening or cocking the ammunition and vice-versa.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">The safety device <b>10</b> for a breechblock comprises a breechblock locking lever <b>15</b>, hinged or pivoted to the structure of the firearm on an axis <b>11</b>, for example at a front end <b>16</b> of a structure <b>17</b> of the firearm, as well as an elastic return element <b>18</b> of the locking lever <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">The locking lever <b>15</b>, equipped with an engagement element <b>19</b>, for example a tooth with a substantially rectangular section with bevelled corners, facing towards the breechblock <b>14</b>, intervenes in a seat <b>20</b>, with a substantially matching shape, realised in the lower wall of the breechblock <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The locking lever <b>15</b> is realised symmetrically with respect to a middle plane of the firearm, represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with a line <b>21</b>. It comprises a longitudinal neck <b>22</b> and a mass <b>23</b>, which lowers the centre of gravity (G) of the locking lever <b>15</b> with respect to the fulcrum, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">The fulcrum of the locking lever <b>15</b> of the breechblock <b>14</b> consists of a pin <b>24</b> which, in a preferred embodiment of the safety device <b>10</b> object of the present invention, is realised integral with the lever <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">The pin <b>24</b> has bevelled side engagement projections <b>25</b>, which ease the pressure assembly operations in two holes <b>26</b>, aligned with each other on the axis of rotation <b>11</b>, realised at the front end <b>16</b> of the structure, shaped as a fork to house the locking lever <b>15</b> and to allow its rotation in the middle plane of line <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">The elastic return element <b>18</b> consists, for example, of a spring, fixed to the connection lever <b>15</b> and to the structure <b>17</b>, which keeps the lever <b>15</b> in rest state, thus with the tooth <b>19</b> disengaged from the seat <b>20</b> of the breechblock <b>14</b>, during normal use of the firearm. The spring <b>18</b>, also symmetrical with respect to the middle plane <b>21</b>, is equipped with two windings <b>27</b>, arranged on opposite sides of the pin <b>24</b> and held in position between the neck <b>22</b> of the locking lever <b>15</b> and the side walls of the fork <b>16</b>. The windings <b>27</b>, joined by a central portion <b>28</b> resting upon an upper wall of the neck <b>22</b> of the lever, are each equipped with an end <b>29</b>, fixed in a seat <b>30</b> of the front forked end <b>16</b> of the structure.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">In a preferred embodiment of the safety device <b>10</b> for a breechblock, object of the present invention, the locking lever <b>15</b> and the front end <b>16</b> of the structure have interfacing walls <b>31</b> equipped with matching profiles with a cylindrical generatrix, which guide the movement of the lever <b>15</b> during its rotation about the pivoting axis <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Moreover, the interfacing walls <b>31</b> of the lever <b>15</b> and of the structure <b>17</b> are equipped with abutment elements, which define an upper switch limit position and a lower switch limit position of the rotation of the lever <b>15</b>, respectively with the tooth <b>19</b> engaged in the seat <b>20</b> or with such a tooth disengaged from the breechblock <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">In the example shown, an element <b>32</b> protruding from the wall of the structure <b>17</b> is engaged in a groove <b>33</b> formed on the wall of the lever <b>15</b>, which slides in the structure.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">Through the effect of knocks undergone by the rear part of the structure <b>17</b>, such as those generated by use of the firearm to knock down an obstacle, or in the case of the firearm itself being dropped, high accelerations are generated acting upon the firearm in the direction in which the breechblock slides and going towards the front part of the firearm.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">Under the action of such accelerations, through the effect of the inertia force directed towards the rear part, the breechblock <b>14</b> would tend to translate and move back until it is in open position, consequently causing the involuntary loss of a cartridge in the chamber or involuntarily feeding a cartridge.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">Such accelerations also act upon the locking lever <b>15</b>, and in particular upon its mass <b>23</b>, decentred with respect to the pivoting axis <b>11</b>. Through the effect of the inertia forces the mass <b>23</b> of the locking lever <b>15</b> is made to rotate about the fulcrum <b>11</b> to align the centre of gravity G of the locking lever <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">The rotation of the locking lever <b>15</b> puts the tooth <b>19</b> in engagement in the seat <b>20</b> of the breechblock <b>14</b>, preventing it from moving back under the thrust of the inertia forces.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">The elastic element, or spring <b>18</b>, loaded during the rotary movement, takes the locking lever <b>15</b> back into rest position, at the end of the intervention of the inertia forces, and holds it is such a position regardless of vibrations, oscillations or other movements to which the firearm is subjected.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">The safety device for a breechblock of a firearm, object of the present invention, advantageously exploits the same physical principle which would cause the accidental translation of the breechblock for its intervention with the breechblock itself.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The safety device for a breechblock of a firearm thus conceived is susceptible to numerous modifications and variants, all covered by the invention. Moreover, all of the details can be replaced with technically equivalent elements. In practice, the materials used, as well as the sizes, can be whatever according to the technical requirements.</p>

<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="P-00001" num="00001">A preferred handguard for a rifle includes a pair of essentially identical half-grip pieces each having an elongated body with a generally triangular lateral cross-section, including two exterior sides and a mating side. The exterior sides of the triangular cross-section are formed substantially at a right angle to each other. The mating side of the triangular cross-section is centrally hollowed and has outer edges that form a mating surface for mating with the other half-grip piece to enclose an air space surrounding a section of the rifle barrel. Longitudinally extending accessory mounting rails are formed on each of the exterior sides and are recessed in the half-grip piece such that the rails are located inside a laterally extended generally semi-octagonal outline defined by an end wall. Removable elastomeric rail covers that replicate the semi-octagonal outline are provided to form a substantially continuous shape with the end wall.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1115" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">This invention is related to the general field of forearm handguards for firearms, and to the particular field of forearm handguards for high rate of fire tactical rifles and carbines such as the M16/AR15 family.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1125" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Tactical shoulder rifles enable rapid high-volume fire that can heat the rifle barrel to very high temperatures. To protect the rifleman against contact with the hot surface, and to help dissipate the heat, the barrel is usually shrouded by a handguard or grip that completely encloses the portion of the barrel directly in front of the receiver over a length sufficient to provide a grip area for the rifleman's lead hand. This type of forearm handguard is usually &#x201c;free-floating&#x201d;, i.e. connected to the rifle only at end-cap fittings and not directly in contact with the barrel. The handguard thus creates an air space around the barrel to retard heat conduction from the barrel into the handguard. The handguard is vented with air holes or slots to allow heat convection out of the enclosed air space. An early example of this type handguard is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,965,994. The handguard described in this reference has a laminated construction, comprising a fiberglass-reinforced plastic outer skin laminated to a low-density foam core, with the inner surface covered by a reflecting foil.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Forearm handguards can have a generally triangular or pear-like sectional shape wherein the base is wider and more flat than the top, as in the earlier versions of M16. This configuration provides a wider support area for the palm when firing offhand, and a more stable platform when firing over a rest, than would a handguard with a narrow bottom. However, there are advantages to a generally cylindrical handguard wherein the top and bottom pieces are identical mating semi-oval half-pieces, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,536,982 and 4,663,875. In such handguards, the area at the center of the half pieces (top and bottom of the assembled handguard) is a flat longitudinal rib with a row of vent holes. The exterior of the top and bottom half-pieces described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,536,982 have laterally extending ribs over most of the surface to enhance structural integrity and provide a firm grip, while the flat longitudinal rib has small longitudinal grooves, perhaps to improve the rest characteristic.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">It is also known to attach one or more rail adapters to or along a forearm handguard to mount various accessories to the rifle, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,826,363; 5,590,484 and 5,198,600. When an adapter rail is not being used, it can be protected by covering it with a panel that slides along the grooves at the sides of the rail, as shown in the above U.S. Pat. No. 5,826,363.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Recent improvements in handguard technology are disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,609,321. The handguard is lightweight and easily assembled, combining several features shown in the above references, with improvements in how the features are interrelated. In particular, the handguard is made of two injection-molded plastic half-grip pieces, at least one of which has an integrally-molded accessory rail that it is recessed in the area at the center of the half-grip piece. This recessed positioning locates the ribs and guide channel of the rail inside what would be the extended arc of the sides of the half-grip piece in the traditional handguard of this type. A rail cover is provided that replicates the extended arc of the sides of the half-grip piece up to a flat longitudinally extending rib along the center of the cover. Thus, with the cover installed, the grip has essentially the same feel and dimensions as the traditional oval grip as described and shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,536,982 and 4,663,875. Vent holes may be positioned between the opposing ribs of the rail, and the cover may have matching vent holes in registry with the holes between the rails.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1150" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The handguard of the present invention includes first and second mating half-grip pieces. Preferably, the first and second half-grip pieces are substantially identical. At least the first half-grip piece includes an elongated body having a generally triangular lateral cross-section with two exterior sides and a mating side. The exterior sides of the triangular cross-section are formed substantially at a right angle to each other. The mating side of the triangular cross-section is centrally hollowed and has outer edges that form a mating surface for mating with the other half-grip piece to enclose an air space surrounding a section of the rifle barrel between the receiver and the front-sight/gas return tube assembly.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">At least the first half-grip piece has a longitudinally extending accessory mounting rail formed on each of the exterior sides substantially at right angles to each other and recessed in the half-grip piece such that the rails are located inside a laterally extended generally semi-octagonal outline that can be defined by an end wall of the half-grip piece.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">The half-grip pieces have a semicircular opening for wrapping around the barrel of the firearm and at least the first grip piece has a slot extending from the semi-circular opening for receiving the gas return tube of the firearm. The slot projects from the semicircular opening at a substantially right angle to one of the exterior sides. When the half-grip pieces are assembled, the semicircular openings mate to form a substantially circular opening. The half-grip pieces are formed so that the handguard has a mounting apparatus surrounding the circular opening. The mounting apparatus includes a ring with a generally hexagonal outer shape and at least two, and preferably six, semi-arcuate engagement tabs disposed about the ring so that the apparatus can engage either a triangular front handguard retaining ring or a circular front handguard retaining ring.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">At least the first half-grip piece can also include a cover for each accessory mounting rail. The covers are adapted to cover the rails when the rails are not in use. When engaged with the rails, the covers and exposed surface of the body define a generally semi-octagonal outer shape that is substantially continuous with that defined by the end wall.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">The first half-grip piece is described below in more detail as the top-left half-grip piece. It has already been noted that the two pieces are preferably substantially identical. However, in the event that the first and second half-grip pieces are not substantially identical, the half-grip piece described in detail below could instead be the bottom-right half grip piece, and the top-left could be different. It is also possible to form mirror images of the piece described herein.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1311" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">In the Figures, in which like reference numerals identify like elements, there is shown a handguard <b>10</b> for a rifle. The handguard can be used with a rifle of the M16/AR15 family in a manner similar to that shown in the above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 6,609,321, which is incorporated herein by reference. The length of the handguard <b>10</b> can be different from that shown in the drawings to accommodate a variety of rifles with different barrel lengths. Commonly owned U.S. Design Pat. App. No. 29/181,026, which is incorporated herein by reference, shows handguards for both a long rifle and a short rifle.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The handguard <b>10</b> is made of two half-grip pieces, shown as a bottom-right half piece <b>12</b> and a top-left half-grip piece <b>14</b>, which are mated together along mating surfaces <b>16</b>. It is also possible to configure the handguard as a mirror image of that shown in the drawings, in which case the handguard would have a top-right half grip piece and a bottom-left half-grip piece (not shown). The half-grip pieces include an elongated body formed from an injection-molded high density polymer. A preferred material is high temperature nylon reinforced with fiberglass.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of the exterior side and front of the top-left half-grip piece <b>14</b>. The bottom-right half-grip piece <b>12</b> is preferably identical, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so that the pieces can be formed with a common mold. The half-grip piece <b>14</b> includes removable covers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, which are preferably flexible. The removable covers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, when in place, provide the half-grip piece <b>14</b> with an exterior lateral section of a generally semi-octagonal shape, generally flattened at the cover tops <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and slightly depressed at flattened surface <b>26</b> (part of the half-grip piece body) between the covers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. The terms &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; and &#x201c;laterally&#x201d;, as used herein, refer to directions that are transverse to the longitudinal axis of the elongated body, including left, right, up and down. The half-grip piece <b>14</b> further includes an end wall <b>28</b> at its rearward end. The end wall <b>28</b> defines a generally semi-octagonal exterior shape that is substantially continuous with that defined by the covers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and flattened surface <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show the exterior front and side of the half-grip piece <b>14</b> with the covers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> removed. The back of the piece <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) looks the same with the covers engaged and removed. The half-grip piece <b>14</b> has an elongated body with a generally triangular lateral cross-section having two shorter exterior sides <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and a longer mating side <b>34</b>, the exterior sides <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the triangular cross-section being formed substantially at a right angle to each other, the longer side <b>34</b> of the triangular cross-section being centrally hollowed and having outer edges <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> that form a mating surface for mating with the other half-grip piece. When the two half-grip pieces are mated, they form the forearm handguard <b>10</b>, which encloses an air space surrounding a portion of the rifle barrel <b>11</b> between the receiver <b>13</b> and the front-sight/gas return tube assembly <b>15</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">The half-grip piece <b>14</b> has a longitudinally extending accessory mounting rail <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> formed in the lateral center of each of the exterior sides <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> thereof. Each of the accessory mounting rails <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> have two rows of opposing posts <b>44</b> and a guide channel <b>46</b> along and depending under each row. Rails of this type are well known and often identified as Picatinny Rails. Another common accessory rail is the Weaver Rail, which may alternatively be used. The accessory rails <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are recessed within the area defined by the laterally extended exterior semi-octagonal shape, as defined by the end wall <b>28</b> alone when the covers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are removed, rather than extending outwardly beyond the piece. This recessed positioning locates the posts <b>44</b> and guide channels <b>46</b> of the rail inside what would be the extended outline (generally semi-octagonal sectional shape) of the exterior sides of the half-grip piece if the exterior sides were extended in a manner similar to the end wall <b>28</b>. This relationship can be seen clearly in FIG. <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">Ventilation holes <b>48</b> are located inside the accessory rail <b>40</b> between the opposing post rows <b>44</b>. Corresponding ventilation holes <b>50</b> are located in the top <b>22</b> of the cover <b>18</b>. The holes are in registry with each other when the cover <b>18</b> is in place.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">The covers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> engage and cover the respective rails <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> when the rails are not in use. As noted above, the covers are preferably flexible, and can be formed from a heat-resistant elastomeric material. The preferred material for making the cover is an injection molded thermoplastic rubber with a hardness of between 65 and 85 Shore A.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">The outside of the covers can be provided with a series of recesses <b>52</b>, ribs (not shown) or other formations for enhancing grip and/or providing a pleasing appearance. In addition, the generally flattened tops of the covers can be provided with a series of parallel longitudinal ribs <b>54</b>, which are preferably continuous with the end wall <b>28</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, looking at the rear of cover <b>20</b>, i.e. the open end that abuts end wall <b>28</b>, the bottom of the cover <b>20</b> is hollowed to receive the rail <b>42</b>. The cover <b>18</b> is the same as cover <b>20</b> except that the front wall <b>57</b> of the cover <b>20</b> does not have an arcuate recess like the one centrally disposed in the front wall <b>56</b> of cover <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for receiving a semi-arcuate engagement tab, which is described below. (The cover <b>18</b> also has vent holes <b>50</b>, which would not be seen from the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7.</figref>) Lips <b>58</b> extend inwardly from the sides of the cover into the hollow <b>60</b>. The lips can be substantially triangular in lateral cross-section, flat at the bottom <b>62</b> so as to be flush with the body of the half-grip piece <b>14</b> when engaged, and sloping downwardly and inwardly (into the hollow) at the interior sides <b>64</b>. The configuration provides the hollow with a trapezoidal lateral cross-section, which is narrowest at its open bottom. The hollow is open at the back, where the installed cover abuts the end wall <b>28</b>, but enclosed at the front <b>57</b> to conceal the front of the rails when engaged therewith. To engage the cover <b>20</b> with the rail <b>42</b>, the lips <b>58</b> can deform around the rail <b>42</b> and grip in the guide channels <b>46</b>&#x2032;. Similarly, the cover can be deformed around the rail again to remove the cover from the rail.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">When the flexible rubber cover <b>20</b> is mounted on the rail <b>42</b>, the lips <b>58</b> provide substantial friction against the rails in guide channels <b>46</b>&#x2032;. In addition, the bottom <b>90</b> of the cover top portion <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) can be molded with post engaging members for limiting longitudinal movement of the cover <b>20</b> relative to the rail <b>42</b>. The post engaging members can include indentations <b>92</b> that mate with the posts <b>44</b>&#x2032; of the rail <b>42</b>. An extended indentation <b>92</b>A can be provided if the rail includes an extended post proximate the front end, as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. Thus, each of the posts can fit into an indentation <b>92</b> when the cover <b>2</b>Q is installed on the rail <b>42</b>. Additional post engaging members can include lateral ribs <b>94</b> in between all or some of the indentations <b>92</b>. The ribs <b>94</b> can be provided in between every second set of indentations, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, so that the vent holes <b>50</b> may be easily punched or cut from the non-ribbed areas if a cover <b>18</b> is to be produced. When mounted on the rail <b>42</b>, the lateral ribs <b>94</b> are disposed between the posts <b>44</b>&#x2032;. A series of recesses can also be provided along the bottom surfaces <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">Given the engagement of posts <b>44</b> with indentations <b>92</b>, the position of the lateral ribs <b>94</b> and the friction provided by the rubber material, the covers will not slide longitudinally with respect to the body of the half-grip piece <b>14</b> under conditions of normal use. However, the covers can be easily removed and reinstalled by deforming the lips <b>48</b> around the rails.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">The rubber covers can be used when an accessory is mounted on the rail, and cut to length to cover the portions of the rail that are not covered by the accessory. If desired, slideable rigid covers or a combination of different covers, such as those described in the above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 6,609,321, could instead be provided.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">A generally semicircular mounting apparatus <b>66</b> extends from the front end of the half-grip piece. The mounting apparatus is configured to engage against the rifle's handguard retaining assembly (not shown). The apparatus <b>66</b> includes a half-ring <b>66</b>A, which is interrupted by a slot <b>70</b>, described below. The half-ring has a substantially semi-circular inner diameter and a substantially polygonal outer shape, preferably a hexagonal outer shape. The apparatus further includes three semi-arcuate engagement tabs <b>66</b>B, <b>66</b>C, <b>66</b>D. The engagement tab <b>66</b>B protrudes partially above the exterior side <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">When properly mated with an identical half-grip piece <b>12</b>, The mounting apparatus <b>66</b> forms a ring with a generally hexagonal outer shape and a series of six semi-arcuate engagement tabs disposed about the ring at about 60 degree increments. This arrangement permits the handguard <b>10</b> to be mounted on a rifle equipped with either a triangular front handguard retaining ring, such as an M16A1, or a circular front handguard retaining ring, such as the M16A2.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">The apparatus <b>66</b> defines a semicircular opening <b>68</b> for wrapping around the barrel <b>11</b> of the firearm. Extending from the semicircular portion of the opening is a slot <b>70</b>, which interrupts half-ring <b>66</b>A, for receiving the gas return tube <b>17</b> of the firearm. Such gas return tubes are conventional on rifles of the AR15/M16 family, and are shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,875. The gas return tube <b>17</b> is located above the barrel <b>11</b> in the vertical plane of the rifle. The slot <b>70</b> projects from the semicircular opening at a substantially right angle to the exterior side <b>30</b>. Thus, it is intended that when the handguard <b>10</b> is assembled, the slot <b>70</b> will engage the gas return tube <b>17</b> and the exterior side <b>30</b> will become the top of the handguard <b>10</b>. Note that the mating surfaces <b>16</b> form substantially a 45 degree angle off the vertical plane of the firearm when the handguard <b>10</b> is properly mounted.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the half-grip piece <b>14</b> can alternatively be equipped with a smooth half-ring <b>67</b>, which is interrupted by a slot <b>70</b>&#x2032;, rather than the mounting apparatus <b>66</b>. The smooth half-ring <b>67</b> can be used if the handguard <b>10</b> is only to be used with a rifle equipped with a circular front handguard retaining ring. Shorter versions of the handguard <b>10</b>, which can be used with carbine style rifles, can also be provided with a smooth half-ring <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">Similar to the front end of the half-grip piece, a semicircular mounting ring <b>72</b> extends from the rear end of the half-grip, as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. This is a conventional extension to engage against the rifle's Delta ring <b>19</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, except that the ring <b>72</b> has a center slot <b>74</b> for the rifle's gas return tube <b>17</b>. Like the slot <b>70</b>, the slot <b>74</b> is oriented transversely to the exterior surface <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the interior of the half-grip piece <b>14</b> may have mounting posts <b>76</b> for a metal heat shield (not depicted). The use of heat shields inside forearm handguards is well known and various configurations of shield could be used. The post <b>76</b> provide attachment points for the beat shield, which can have holes formed in it of conforming diameter, by press fitting the shield such that the posts <b>76</b> push through the holes in the shield. The half-grip piece further has longitudinally extending mounting surfaces <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B. The mounting surface <b>16</b>A includes longitudinal recesses <b>78</b> for mating with corresponding longitudinal ribs <b>80</b> provided on mounting surface <b>16</b>B on the other half-grip piece. In the event that the two half-grip pieces are not identical, appropriate recesses and ribs should be provided on the corresponding mounting surfaces. Alternatively, the recesses <b>78</b> and ribs <b>80</b> can be dispensed with entirely.</p>

<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention relates to a system and a method for a firearm cartridge casing catcher.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Cartridge casing catchers are mounted adjacent the ejection port of a firearm to catch the spent cartridge casings (so-called &#x201c;brass&#x201d;) as the casings are ejected after a round is fired. The brass is generally collected for reloading and to prevent casings from being underfoot which can cause a shooter or observer unstable shooting or movement. The brass may also be collected by a cartridge casing catcher to reduce the evidence left at the shooting site and to reduce the noise generated during the shooting by eliminating the noise generated when the casing impacts the surface (i.e., floor, roof, etc.) where the shooter (i.e., firearm user) is positioned. An example of a conventional spent shell container is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,166,333 to Kratzer (Kratzer '333).</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Conventional brass catchers such as shown in the Kratzer '333 patent may have a deficiency in that spent cartridges are ejected with a significant force and tend to bounce inside the collection chamber and in some instances, the spent cartridge can bounce back into the firearm ejection port causing the firearm to jam. Such a jam is highly undesirable when the firearm user is involved in a critical mission situation.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Conventional brass catchers such as shown in the Kratzer '333 patent may have additional deficiencies in that the spent cartridges tend to rattle in the collection chamber and thus cause additional undesirable noise, and the impact of the spent cartridge one the sides and bottom of the catcher can cause a drumming of the conventional catcher structure and radiation of the corresponding noise.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The muzzle report of blow back operated and closed breech firearms may be reduced by the installation of a so-called &#x201c;silencer&#x201d; (more properly called a suppressor) on the muzzle, integral with the barrel of the firearm, or both on the muzzle and integral with the barrel. Examples of conventional firearms suppressors are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,033,356 to Richardson, U.S. Pat. No. 1,018,720 to Maxim, and U.S. Pat. No. 1,229,675 to Thompson. However, significant noise and flash (i.e., blast) are generated and expelled at the breech of the firearm, especially for open-bolt (or blowback) firearms, and from a closed breech weapon to an extent which can be unacceptable for clandestine operations. For example, weapons such as the Heckler &#x26; Koch Model HK MP5SD, while having very low muzzle report, still produce noise and flash from the ejection port which presents a blast that may be significant and unacceptable in some situations and open bolt weapons such as the Ingram&#x2014;10, even when equipped with a muzzle suppressor, still can produce noise (as well as flash) from the breech that is at a level such that the user advisably wears ear protection to reduce the likelihood of hearing loss. Conventional brass catchers such as shown in the Kratzer '333 patent and especially bag type brass catchers may provide some flash reduction but provide very little reduction of the noise emitted at the firearm port.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">Thus, there exists a need and an opportunity for an improved system and an improved method for a cartridge casing catcher. Such an improved system and an improved method for a cartridge casing catcher may provide reduced or eliminated bouncing of the spent cartridges back into the firearm ejection port and so reduce or eliminate jamming caused by the spent cartridges bouncing back, reduced or eliminated noise and flash from a firearm ejection port, reduced or eliminated rattle of collected brass, and reduced or eliminated brass catcher structure drumming.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1180" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Accordingly, the present invention may provide an improved system and method for a cartridge casing catcher. Such an improved system and an improved method for a cartridge casing catcher may provide reduced or eliminated bouncing of the spent cartridges back into the firearm ejection port and so reduce or eliminate jamming caused by the spent cartridges bouncing back, reduced or eliminated noise and flash from a firearm ejection port, reduced or eliminated rattle of collected brass, and reduced or eliminated brass catcher structure drumming when compared to conventional approaches.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1272" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">With reference to the Figures, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail. Generally, the present invention provides an improved system and method for a cartridge casing catcher (i.e., a &#x201c;brass catcher&#x201d;). The cartridge casing catcher of the present invention is generally mounted (i.e., fastened, fixed, attached, etc.) adjacent to and covering (i.e., over, in communication with, etc.) an ejection port of a semi-automatic or full-automatic firearm. In one example, the present invention may be advantageously mounted to the firearm via an apparatus similar to the mounting shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,166,333 to Kratzer (hereinafter Kratzer '333), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In another example, the brass catcher of the present invention may be mounted via a clamping mechanism. However, the present invention may be mounted to the firearm where implemented via any appropriate apparatus to meet the design criteria of a particular application.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a diagram illustrating a system (i.e., apparatus, assembly, receptacle, etc.) <b>100</b> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown. The apparatus <b>100</b> generally comprises a spent cartridge casing catcher (or brass catcher). The brass catcher <b>100</b> generally comprises a generally hollow housing (i.e., case, box, container, etc.) <b>102</b>, a liner assembly <b>104</b>, and a seal <b>106</b>. In one example, the housing <b>102</b> may be implemented having walls configured as a box-on-box structure or shape (i.e., an upper box and a lower box) as illustrated.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">The upper box is generally attached to a firearm (not shown) via an attachment mechanism (not shown) such that an opening <b>130</b> into the housing <b>102</b> communicates with the ejection port of the firearm and receives spent (or expended) cartridges (i.e., empty shells, casings, brass, etc.) as the shells are ejected from the firearm and the blast that is emitted from the ejection port when the firearm is discharged (i.e., when the firearm is fired). The lower box may comprise fixed walls <b>102</b><i>a</i>, a lid <b>102</b><i>b </i>having a hinge <b>108</b>, and an opposing latch (not shown) that may provide for emptying spent cartridges from the catcher <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">The housing <b>102</b> may be implemented having a structure similar to the container (<b>10</b>) disclosed in Kratzer '333. However, the housing <b>102</b> of the present invention is implemented without a perforated back wall (<b>17</b>) as disclosed in Kratzer '333 since such a perforated wall may provide a path for undesirable noise transmission. Further, the case <b>102</b> may be implemented having walls of any appropriate shape and configuration to meet the design criteria of a particular application. The housing <b>102</b> is generally produced (i.e., manufactured, built, made, implemented, etc.) using a substantially rigid material. Example materials for implementation of the case <b>102</b> may include steel, aluminum, rigid plastic, fiber-reinforced plastic, loaded (e.g., with a dense material such as lead, clay, or the like) plastic, and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The liner <b>104</b> generally comprises a plurality of deflectors (i.e., fins, blades, wedges, etc.) <b>120</b> (described in more detail in connection with FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>). The liner <b>104</b> generally comprises an acoustic foam material that provides barrier and absorption (i.e., the physical process in which incident radiated energy is retained substantially without reflection or transmission) relative to the noise that is presented (i.e., discharged, radiated, emitted, etc.) from the ejection port of the firearm where the catcher <b>100</b> is implemented when the firearm is discharged, and damping to the walls of the housing <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">The liner <b>104</b> acoustic foam is generally implemented as a partially-open cell foam having approximately (i.e., about, substantially, essentially, etc.) 85% cell reticulation (i.e., approximately 85% of the cells have walls that are opened via heat or chemical treatment during the production of the foam and approximately 15% of the cells remain closed). The liner <b>104</b> acoustic foam is generally implemented as a heat and chemical blast resistant material such as a urethane foam. However, the liner <b>104</b> may be implemented form a foam having any appropriate reticulation (e.g., 0% or closed cell foam to essentially 100% or open cell foam) and any appropriate material to meet the design criteria of a particular application. The liner <b>104</b> is generally fastened (e.g., fixed, adhered, etc.) to the inside of the container <b>102</b> via an appropriate adhesive, rivets, hook and loop, barbs on the inner wall of the housing <b>102</b>, or any other appropriate fastening or adhering implementation to meet the design criteria of a particular application.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">The acoustic foam liner <b>104</b> fixed to the inner surface of the case <b>102</b> generally forms a combination of acoustic barrier to noise generated by the blast emitted at the ejection port of the firearm when the firearm is discharged (i.e., the walls of the receptacle <b>100</b> may have a substantial noise transmission loss for the blast noise), absorption of the noise generated by the blast, and damping of the vibration generated by the impact of the casing <b>150</b> on the housing <b>102</b> (i.e., drumming) and deflection of the housing <b>102</b> generated by the blast (i.e., so-called &#x201c;oil-canning&#x201d;). The fins <b>120</b> generally reduce or eliminate tendencies of the casings <b>150</b> to move about and rattle in the housing <b>102</b> and the liner <b>104</b> absorbs noise made by rattling of the casings <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">The seal <b>106</b> generally comprises a resilient, compliant material (e.g., vinyl, butyl, neoprene, etc. in a solid, gel-sac, closed-cell foam, skin covered foam, or other appropriate configuration). The seal <b>106</b> is generally fastened to the edge of the housing <b>102</b> and liner <b>104</b> that abut the ejection port region of the firearm. While the housing <b>102</b> and the seal <b>106</b> are shown having a substantially flat surface that contacts the firearm where the present invention is implemented, the housing <b>102</b> at the opening <b>130</b> and the seal <b>106</b> are generally shaped to substantially match an interfacing surface of the firearm where the catcher <b>100</b> is implemented. When the catcher <b>100</b> is mounted to the firearm, the seal <b>106</b> generally provides a substantial barrier to noise and flash (e.g., a substantially air-tight or hermetic seal) that is generated during the ejection of a spent cartridge. The seal <b>106</b> may be configured to provide a substantially air-tight path between the ejection port and the opening <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a diagram illustrating a sectional view of the brass catcher <b>100</b> taken at the line <b>140</b>&#x2014;<b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown. The liner <b>104</b> generally comprises the wedges <b>120</b> and a base portion (i.e., section, area, layer, etc.) <b>122</b>. The wedges <b>120</b> are generally configured to deflect ejected casings <b>150</b> (e.g., casings <b>150</b><i>a</i>-<b>150</b><i>n</i>) away from the opening <b>130</b> (i.e., away from the ejection port and into the lower box region of the housing <b>102</b> near the lid <b>102</b><i>b</i>). The fins <b>120</b> generally deflect either rimmed cartridges such as the casings <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>d </i>or rimless casings such as the casing <b>150</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Each of the wedges <b>120</b> may have a face <b>160</b> that is oriented toward the opening <b>130</b> and a face <b>162</b> that is oriented away from the opening <b>130</b>. The face <b>160</b> is generally slanted away from the opening <b>130</b> such that the casings <b>150</b> are deflected away from the opening <b>130</b> and generally toward the lid <b>102</b><i>b</i>. The face <b>162</b> is generally perpendicular the planar surface of the housing <b>102</b> or slanted away from the opening <b>130</b> such that the casings <b>150</b> are resisted from traveling (moving, bouncing, flying, etc.) back toward the opening <b>130</b> even when bouncing inside the housing <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a diagram illustrating a sectional view of alternative embodiments of the deflectors <b>120</b> (e.g., deflectors <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c</i>) is shown. The liner <b>104</b> generally has a thickness (e.g., T). The thickness T generally comprises the sum of the thickness of the wedges <b>120</b> (e.g., W) and the base portion <b>122</b> (e.g., B). That is, T=W+B. The wedges <b>120</b> are generally of approximately (i.e., substantially, essentially, about, etc.) the same height (or thickness) W.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">The wedge <b>120</b> height W is generally equal to or greater than the diameter of the cartridge casing <b>150</b> that is captured (or caught) by the brass catcher <b>100</b>. The base <b>122</b> height B is generally approximately equal to the deflector <b>120</b> height W. However, the heights W and B may be implemented as any appropriate thickness to meet the design criteria of a particular application.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">The front face <b>160</b> is generally at an angle (e.g., FA) relative to a line or plane (e.g., P) that is perpendicular to the surface of the region <b>122</b> that is fastened to the housing <b>102</b>. The angle FA is generally in a range of 30 degrees to 75 degrees and preferably in a range of 45 degrees to 60 degrees. The rear face <b>162</b> is generally at an angle (e.g., RA) relative to line or plane P. The angle RA is generally in a range of 0 degrees to 35 degrees and preferably in a range of 0 degrees to 25 degrees. The angle RA is generally less than the angle FA. However, the angles FA and RA may be implemented at any appropriate angles to meet the design criteria of a particular application.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">In one example, the fins <b>120</b> may be adjacent as illustrated by the fins <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>. In another example, the fins <b>120</b> may be separated by a gap (e.g., G) as illustrated by the fins <b>120</b><i>b </i>and <b>120</b><i>c</i>. The gap G is generally approximately equal to or less than the wedge height W.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a diagram illustrating a sectional view of alternative embodiments of the surface treatment of the deflectors <b>120</b> (e.g., deflectors <b>120</b><i>r</i>-<b>120</b><i>t</i>) is shown. In one example (e.g., wedge <b>120</b><i>r</i>), the foam that comprises the liner <b>104</b> may be uncovered. In another example (e.g., wedge <b>120</b><i>s</i>), the front surface <b>160</b> may be covered by a layer <b>170</b>. In yet another example (e.g., wedge <b>120</b><i>t</i>), the front surface <b>160</b> may be covered by the layer <b>170</b> and the rear surface <b>162</b> may be covered by a layer <b>172</b>. The layers <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> are generally implemented as a perforated material having a plurality of holes <b>180</b>. The layers <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> are generally implemented from a material such as vinyl, butyl, neoprene, and the like. The layers <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> are generally implemented to reduce or eliminate degradation or erosion of the liner <b>104</b> due to the blast that is emitted from the ejection port and from the heat of the casings <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a diagram illustrating a plan view of the layers <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> is shown. The holes <b>180</b> generally comprise an area in a range of 30% to 90% of the total area of the layer <b>170</b> or <b>172</b> and preferably an area in a range of 50% to 75% of the total area of the layer <b>170</b> or <b>172</b>. The holes <b>180</b> area generally sized and of sufficient total area to provide protection of the foam that comprises the liner <b>104</b> while providing reduction or elimination of degradation or erosion to the liner <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">As is apparent then from the above detailed description, the present invention may provide an improved system and method for a cartridge casing catcher. Such an improved system and an improved method for a cartridge casing catcher may provide reduced or eliminated noise and flash from a firearm ejection port and so reduce or eliminate jamming caused by the spent cartridges bouncing back, reduced or eliminated rattle of collected brass, and reduced or eliminated bouncing of the spent cartridges back into the firearm ejection port when compared to conventional approaches.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1350" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">The above-described drawing figures illustrate the invention, a bird repelling device <b>10</b> for preventing birds from landing on a surface <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the bird repelling device <b>10</b> has an elongate housing <b>24</b> that contains a plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> that are useful for repelling birds. The bird repelling device <b>10</b> includes a means for attaching the elongate housing <b>24</b> to a halyard <b>18</b> so that the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> are operably positioned in proximity to the surface <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bird repelling device <b>10</b> is particularly adapted for mounting on a mast <b>14</b> of a sailboat (not shown). In this embodiment, the means for attaching preferably includes a means for removably attaching the elongate housing <b>24</b> to a clip <b>16</b> of a halyard <b>18</b>. The means for removably attaching may include a top attachment loop <b>40</b> and a bottom attachment loop <b>42</b>. The top attachment loop <b>40</b> is positioned generally towards the top end <b>28</b>. The bottom attachment loop <b>42</b> is positioned generally towards the bottom end <b>30</b>. In this embodiment, the clip <b>16</b> is removably attached to the top attachment loop <b>40</b>. A downhaul line <b>20</b> is threaded through the bottom attachment loop <b>42</b> and attached to the clip <b>16</b>, preferably with a downhaul ring <b>22</b>, although an alternative structure or a simple knot could also be used. In this embodiment, it is preferred that the downhaul line <b>20</b> be directly linked the halyard <b>18</b>, excluding the bird repelling device <b>10</b>, so that the downward force of the downhaul line <b>20</b> is transmitted directly to the halyard <b>18</b>, and is not transmitted through the top attachment loop <b>40</b>, the bottom attachment loop <b>42</b>, or the elongate housing <b>24</b>. In this embodiment, the halyard <b>18</b> is used to raise the elongate housing <b>24</b> to a position adjacent to the top of the mast <b>14</b>. In this position, the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> extend over the surface <b>12</b> at the top of the mast <b>14</b> and prevent birds from roosting thereupon.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the top and bottom attachment loops <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> may be formed from a single length of rope <b>44</b> or similar strand. The rope <b>44</b> includes a top knot <b>46</b>, extends to bridge a pair of top apertures <b>50</b>, and then extends down to bridge a pair of bottom apertures <b>52</b>, where the rope <b>44</b> ends in a bottom knot <b>54</b>. Of course, those skilled in the art can devise alternative embodiments. The top and bottom attachment loops <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> may be formed from two separate ropes or strands. Alternative embodiments also include the use of rigid plastic or metal rings that can be fastened to the elongate housing <b>24</b>, an integral ring or similar aperture, or any other mechanisms that enable the attachment of the halyard <b>18</b> as described.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">In alternative embodiments, not shown, the means for positioning the bird repelling device <b>10</b> may include a variety of attachment mechanisms, bases, or any other form of placement to position the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> adjacent any surface <b>12</b>, thereby preventing birds resting upon the surface <b>12</b>. For example, the bird repelling device <b>10</b> may include a sturdy base (not shown) that allows the elongate housing <b>24</b> to be positioned adjacent any generally flat surface, such as the deck of a sailboat (not shown). The base (not shown) may be in the form of a tripod, a broad, skid-proof rubber surface, or other configuration that can be devised by those skilled in the art. The elongate housing <b>24</b> may also include attachment mechanisms, clips, brackets, or similar mechanisms (not shown) that can be used to hang, mount, position, or otherwise locate or arrange the bird repelling device <b>10</b> adjacent a surface that may attract birds. It is understood that those skilled in the art can devise countless alternative uses for the bird repelling device <b>10</b>, and easily adapt attachment means that are suitable for a particular use. These alternative embodiments, while not explicitly shown herein, should be considered within the scope of the invention as claimed below.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the elongate housing <b>24</b> has a slide chamber <b>26</b> that extends longitudinally from a top end <b>28</b> to a bottom end <b>30</b> of the elongate housing <b>24</b>. The elongate housing <b>24</b> is preferably generally cylindrically shaped and preferably includes a cap <b>32</b> that is positioned generally adjacent to the top end <b>28</b> of the slide chamber <b>26</b>. The cap <b>32</b> is preferably positioned to seal the top end <b>28</b> of the elongate housing <b>24</b> and includes a plurality of rod apertures <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">The cap <b>32</b> is useful for correctly positioning the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b>, and for containing the slide mechanism <b>36</b> within the slide chamber <b>26</b>, it is not necessarily required for the function of the invention. For example, the slide mechanism <b>36</b> could be contained within the slide chamber <b>26</b> with other features, such as a bead <b>62</b>, described below, if it were large enough, or a ridge (not shown) within the slide chamber <b>26</b> that would block the upward movement of the slide mechanism <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">The slide mechanism <b>36</b> is adapted to slidably engage the slide chamber <b>26</b> to slide between an extended position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and a retracted position, shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. The plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> are attached to the slide mechanism <b>36</b> so that their position is controlled by the position of the slide mechanism <b>36</b>. In the extended position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the slide mechanism <b>36</b> is positioned at the top end <b>28</b> of the elongate housing <b>24</b>, near the cap <b>32</b>. When the slide mechanism <b>36</b> is in the extended position, a substantial part of each of the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> extends out of the top end <b>28</b> of the slide chamber <b>26</b>, above the elongate housing <b>24</b>. The plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> are thereby operably positioned to repel birds.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">When the bird repelling device <b>10</b> is not in use, the slide mechanism <b>36</b> is moved from the extended position to the retracted position, as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. When the slide mechanism <b>36</b> is moved to the retracted position, the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> are adapted to be positioned substantially within the slide chamber <b>26</b>, so that only terminal ends <b>66</b> of the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> extend through the plurality of rod apertures <b>34</b>. In this position, the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> are positioned almost entirely within the elongate housing <b>24</b> and are therefore protected from damage. This position facilitates shipment and storage of the bird repelling device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the slide mechanism <b>36</b> preferably includes a pull rope <b>56</b> that can be used to pull the slide mechanism <b>36</b> from the extended position to the retracted position. The pull rope <b>56</b> includes a first end <b>58</b> that is attached to the slide mechanism <b>36</b>, and a second end <b>60</b> that is adapted to be grasped by the user. The second end <b>60</b> preferably includes a bead <b>62</b> that facilitates the user grasping and pulling on the bottom end <b>30</b>. It is possible to omit this element, however, and control the position of the slide mechanism <b>36</b> by pushing or pulling on the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b>. It is also possible to replace this element with an alternative structure, not shown, such as a pin extending from an alternative slide mechanism that extends through a longitudinal slot though an alternative elongate housing. These and alternative structures should be considered within the scope of the claimed invention.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, each of the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> preferably include a weighted bulb <b>64</b> at the terminal end <b>66</b>. The terminal end <b>66</b> of each of the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> includes a crimped portion <b>68</b>, and the weighted bulb <b>64</b> is molded over the crimped portion <b>68</b>. The weighted bulb <b>64</b> is preferably heavy enough to overcome the resilience of one of the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> so that the one of the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> bends to form a curve. The plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> function best in the present embodiment when they are bent to a curve that extends a distance horizontally.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">It is not necessary that the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> curve, as in the present embodiment. In alternative embodiments, the weighted bulbs <b>64</b> are merely lightweight elements that are ornamental and/or function to prevent the bird repelling rods <b>38</b> from sliding entirely through the rod apertures <b>34</b> of the cap <b>32</b> and into the elongate housing <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> are preferably constructed of a flexible, weather resistant, and corrosion resistant material, such as aluminum, plastic, or other suitable material. The elongate housing <b>24</b> is preferably constructed of a durable, light weight plastic or other suitable material that would be weather resistant and corrosion resistant. The weighted bulbs <b>64</b> at the terminal ends <b>66</b> of the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> would preferably be constructed of a plastic or rubber material or other similar material, preferably a material that can be injection molded onto the terminal ends <b>66</b> of the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b>. The plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> are preferably constructed of stainless steel, aluminum, plastic, or similar resilient material.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">The invention includes a method for preventing birds from landing on a surface <b>12</b> using the bird repelling device <b>10</b> described above. The bird repelling device <b>10</b> is initially provided in a retracted position for shipment and/or storage. In this position, the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> are positioned substantially within the slide chamber <b>26</b>. When the bird repelling device <b>10</b> is ready for use, the slide mechanism <b>36</b> is moved to the extended position such that each of the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> extend substantially out of the slide chamber <b>26</b>, above the elongate housing <b>24</b>. The bird repelling device <b>10</b> is then positioned so that the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> are operably positioned in proximity to the surface <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bird repelling device <b>10</b> is attached to the clip <b>16</b> of the halyard <b>18</b>, preferably using the top attachment loop <b>40</b>. The downhaul line <b>20</b> is then threaded through the bottom attachment loop <b>42</b> and attached to the clip <b>16</b>, preferably with the downhaul ring <b>22</b>. The halyard <b>18</b> is then used to raise the elongate housing <b>24</b> to a position adjacent to the top of the mast <b>14</b> so that the plurality of bird repelling rods <b>38</b> extend over the surface <b>12</b> at the top of the mast <b>14</b> and prevent birds from roosting thereupon. When the sailboat is ready for use, the downhaul line <b>20</b> is used to haul the halyard <b>18</b> and the bird repelling device <b>10</b> back down so that the bird repelling device <b>10</b> can be returned to the retracted position and stored for future use.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">While the invention has been described with reference to at least one preferred embodiment, it is to be clearly understood by those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited thereto. Rather, the scope of the invention is to be interpreted only in conjunction with the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e504" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">This invention relates to a device which is propelled on the underside of an ice mass formed on a body of water.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">Often it is desirable to gain access to water laying underneath expansive ice blocks. Ice fishing, popular in the winter months in colder climates when the ice is thick enough to walk on, is one example. Traditionally, ice fishing utilizes tip-ups or jigging to hold the fishing line and/or alert the sportsman to a strike. Both of these items require the drilling of a hole in the ice and suspending bait dropped down the ice hole. In the first method the bait is suspended by a line from the tip-up. With jigging, the bait is attached to a line and moved up and down by the fisherman. In both cases the area being fished is limited to the water directly beneath the ice hole.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Unfortunately, during ice fishing and other activities involving walking onto ice there is always risk that the ice may weaken causing the sportsman to fall into the water. Because of the rapid cooling effect of cold water, hypothermia with resulting death can occur very quickly. Thus, it is important that methods to extract a partially or completely submerged sportsman be immediately available. Frequently, the only help available is a fellow sportsman.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">In my U.S. Pat. No. 4,642,932, I describe an underwater icewalker used to extend various activities to areas lying under ice which were previously accessible only by submarines or divers. In particular, my invention permitted an ice fisherman to extend his bait beyond the water directly beneath the ice hole.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">However, I have since discovered that the design of the icewalker of my U.S. Pat. No. 4,642,932 does not allow for bi-directional movement of the icewalker, making retrieval difficult. Other problems, such as snagging on the ice underside surface resulting in the icewalker tipping over have been encountered.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Accordingly, there remains a continuing need for improved methods to extend various activities to areas lying under ice. The present invention fulfills this need, and further provides related advantages.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e539" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">It is an object of the present invention to extend various activities to areas lying under ice. In particular, the icewalker of the present invention enables the ice fisherman to greatly increase the fishing area over that ordinarily available using traditional methods of ice fishing, while at the same time allowing for easy retrieval of the icewalker.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">This is accomplished by utilizing a bi-directional underwater icewalker which comprises a flotation base constructed of lightweight water-resistant material; a moveable rod connected to the flotation base; a moveable flotation arm connected to the rod at one end and culminating in a spike for engaging the underside of the ice at the other end; a plurality of flotation base skates connected to the flotation base; a flotation arm skate connected to the flotation arm; and a line attached to the rod. The flotation arm skate is positioned such that when the icewalker is in bi-directional mode, the flotation base skates and floatation arm skate are in contact with the underside of the ice, while the spike is not.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">After drilling an access hole in the ice, the icewalker is positioned beneath the ice. By pulling on the line, the rod moves back, causing the spike to engage the ice and the plurality of flotation base skates to act as runners, thereby moving the icewalker forward. Releasing the line allows the icewalker to assume a stationary position. The task of pulling on the line may be performed as many times as the fisherman desires in order to reach a particular destination under the ice. By exerting slow, gentle pressure on the line, the icewalker may be placed in bi-directional mode allowing for easy retrieval or reverse positioning of the icewalker.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">Optionally, a holding box is added to the rear of the icewalker and is used to hold any item the user desires to transport, for example, chum.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">Alternatively, a second ice hole is drilled, the icewalker is directed to the second ice hole for attachment of a second line, and the icewalker is pulled back and forth beneath the ice. Thus, the area covered in this way by two fishermen is of an immeasurably greater magnitude than that available by drilling a single hole in the ice.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">Another object of this invention is to provide transport for a life saving device to someone who has fallen through the ice. The icewalker, being moveable under ice, can be used to convey such equipment directly or by attachment to the line which is attached to it. The icewalker, because of its ability to float, can itself also serve as a life saving device.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">A further object is to deliver equipment for studying ecological and environmental factors which exist below the ice. For example, the icewalker may be equipped with a camera for taking pictures, or a drag line for collecting sediment or water samples.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">A still further object is to provide a device which is compact, simple to operate and inexpensive to manufacture.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e686" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, attached to flotation base <b>4</b> of underwater icewalker <b>2</b> are a plurality of, preferably four, flotation base skates <b>6</b>. Flotation base skates <b>6</b> are positioned to contact the ice undersurface and are a predetermined shape that allows for non-binding forward and reverse movement of flotation base <b>4</b>. Flotation base skates <b>6</b> may be, for example, washers attached to flotation base <b>4</b> sides, or eyelets <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) attached to flotation base <b>4</b> top.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">Hinge <b>8</b>, for example, a 90 degree bracket <b>10</b>, bolt <b>12</b> and nut <b>14</b> support hinge end <b>24</b> of moveable rod <b>16</b>. Movable rod <b>16</b> is fabricated of a non-floating material, for example, metal. Moveable flotation arm <b>18</b> is movably fastened to, for example, by bolt <b>12</b> and nut <b>14</b> to movable metal rod <b>16</b>. Embedded in an ice contacting end <b>20</b> of moveable flotation arm <b>18</b> is spike <b>22</b>. Also attached to movable flotation arm <b>18</b> is flotation skate <b>38</b>. Flotation skate <b>38</b> is a predetermined shape, for example, an eyelet, that allows for non-binding forward and reverse movement of flotation base <b>4</b> and is positioned to contact the bottom surface of the ice to disengage ice contacting end <b>20</b> at the completion of a forward travel cycle (described below). Optionally, flotation skate <b>38</b> is height adjustable.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">Attached to the bottom of moveable metal rod <b>16</b> is line <b>26</b>. Line <b>26</b> passes through eyelet <b>28</b> which is attached to the under side of the rear end of flotation base <b>4</b>. Attached, for example, by screws, to the front of flotation base <b>4</b> is optional handle <b>30</b>. Optional holding box <b>32</b> is contained within flotation base <b>4</b> and covered with lid <b>34</b>, located so as not to interfere with the travel of rod <b>16</b>. The center of flotation base <b>4</b> is cut out at <b>36</b> so as to allow spike <b>22</b> attached to flotation arm <b>18</b> to engage the under side of the ice. Cut-out <b>36</b> also acts as a groove that prevents a lateral displacement of moving flotation arm <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Preferably, flotation base <b>4</b> and flotation arm <b>18</b> are made of buoyant material, for example wood or plastic. The dimensions of the flotation base are limited only by the physical dimension of ice hole <b>52</b> (FIG. <b>4</b>). Preferably, flotation base <b>4</b> is rectangular in shape, about 4&#xbe; inches in width, 24 inches in length and &#xbe; inches in thickness. The dimension of cut-out <b>36</b> is about 2 inches by 17 inches.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate the use of icewalker <b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, dashed lines show icewalker <b>4</b> at the start of the pulling stroke. Solid lines represent icewalker <b>4</b> at the end of the pulling stroke.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">After drilling hole <b>52</b> in the ice at the starting location, icewalker <b>4</b> is immersed in the water through ice hole <b>52</b>, facing in the direction in which it is to be propelled. The buoyancy of flotation base <b>4</b> causes icewalker <b>4</b> to press up against the underside of the ice. Gravity causes rod <b>16</b> to drop to a vertical position. Flotation arm <b>18</b> attached to rod <b>16</b> floats up until flotation spike <b>22</b> attached to flotation arm <b>18</b> contacts the ice undersurface. The icewalker is now ready to be propelled.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">By pulling on the line <b>26</b>, rod <b>16</b> moves back toward the underside of flotation base <b>4</b>. In so doing, it places pressure on the flotation arm <b>18</b> pushing spike <b>22</b> attached to flotation arm <b>18</b> against and engaging the ice undersurface. By performing this task, icewalker <b>4</b> advances by sliding forward around moveable flotation arm <b>18</b> and spike <b>22</b>. As icewalker <b>2</b> advances, flotation arm <b>18</b> pivots on spike <b>22</b> until flotation skate <b>38</b> contacts the ice undersurface dislodging spike <b>22</b>. Line <b>26</b> is let loose, allowing gravity to once again cause rod <b>16</b> to drop down to the vertical position. Alternatively, rod <b>16</b> may return through the use of, for example, a spring activated hinge <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">As rod <b>16</b> reaches the vertical position, flotation arm <b>18</b> floats upward until spike <b>22</b> attached to flotation arm <b>18</b> once again contacts the ice undersurface. By pulling on line <b>26</b>, rod <b>16</b> once again moves back toward the underside of flotation base <b>4</b> and spike <b>22</b> once again engages the ice undersurface at the new advanced position. The task of pulling on line <b>26</b> to engage spike <b>22</b> can be performed as many times as the sportsman desires in order to reach a destination under the ice.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">To reverse direction of icewalker <b>2</b>, line <b>26</b> is pulled in a steady motion such that icewalker slides along in reverse direction on ice undersurface supported by flotation base skates <b>6</b> and flotation arm skate <b>38</b> without causing spike <b>22</b> to engage the ice undersurface. Flotation arm skate <b>38</b> will ride against the ice undersurface, keeping spike <b>22</b> from engaging the ice undersurface.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, optional holding box <b>32</b> with lid <b>34</b> is used to hold any item the user wishes to transport, for example, chum used for fishing. As the icewalker moves forward, the flow of water through front holes <b>40</b> in the front of holding box <b>32</b> releases the chum through bottom holes <b>42</b> in the bottom of holding box <b>32</b>. In this manner, chum is released each time icewalker <b>2</b> moves forward, thereby attracting fish.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">Icewalker <b>2</b> may be utilized to allow two fishing lines to be attached to each other and pulled back and forth beneath the ice as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>. The use of icewalker <b>4</b> allows for attachment of two fishing lines together so that they are beneath a solid mass of ice. A bait (not shown) may be attached to the connected fishing lines and run back and forth below the ice mass for a distance equal to that traveled by the icewalker.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">To connect two fishing lines together beneath the ice, the sportsman attaches first fishing line <b>44</b> to icewalker <b>2</b>. First fishing line <b>44</b> may, for example, be attached to line <b>26</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>), or first fishing line <b>44</b> may itself be utilized as line <b>26</b>, attached directly to icewalker <b>2</b>. Icewalker <b>2</b> is then used to transport first fishing line <b>44</b> to second ice hole <b>46</b>. Using handle <b>30</b>, icewalker <b>2</b> is pulled through second ice hole <b>46</b>. First fishing line <b>44</b> is detached from icewalker <b>2</b> and reattached to second fishing line <b>48</b>. Both lines are then pulled back under the ice. The distance under the ice between two ice holes may now be fished by attaching a connecting device, for example, a 3-way swivel and bait to the connected fishing lines and dropping it down the ice hole. By reeling the line back and forth between two sportsmen with the bait at the depth the user desires, a large area can be covered, thereby enhancing the sportsman's opportunity to catch more fish.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">Icewalker <b>2</b> can also be used to transport a life saving device to a victim who has fallen through the ice. By attaching a life saving device to, for example, icewalker <b>2</b> or line <b>26</b> and propelling icewalker <b>2</b> to the victim, icewalker <b>2</b> can be used to convey a life saving device to the victim without endangering the rescuers.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">Due to its flotation property, icewalker <b>2</b> itself may serve as a life saving device. For use with rescue, icewalker <b>2</b> is constructed to a predetermined scale large enough to hold a victim afloat or to carry life saving equipment.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">In yet another use, research equipment, for example, a camera for taking photographs of marine life under the ice, is attached to icewalker <b>2</b>. Other equipment, such as a drag line may be attached for collecting bottom or water samples for ecological or other studies.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">Thus, the present invention allows the effective attainment of may pursuits and activities that were either impossible or very much limited using known methods.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">Although the present invention has been described in connection with specific examples and embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention is capable of other variations and modifications within its scope. These examples and embodiments are intended as typical of, rather than in any way limiting on, the scope of the present invention as presented in the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1246" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref> thereof, a new fishing biting tool embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref>, the fish biting indication device <b>10</b> generally comprises a ring member <b>12</b> having a generally circular shape. The ring member <b>12</b> has a substantially smooth outer surface so that it may freely slide along a fishing rod <b>6</b>. The ring member <b>12</b> has an inner diameter generally between &#xbd; inch and 2 inches. The ring member <b>12</b> comprises a resilient plastic material. The plastic material is preferably buoyant in water. Optionally, the plastic material is phosphorescent. This may be either an ambient light induced phosphorescent or may be brought about by a chemical reaction within the ring member. Both methods are conventional and well known in the art of glowing articles.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">A loop <b>14</b> is optionally attached to the ring member <b>12</b>. The loop <b>14</b> is positioned on an outer circumference of the ring member <b>12</b> and has an inner diameter smaller than the inner diameter of the ring member <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a plurality of ring members <b>12</b>, one of which including a loop <b>14</b>. An elongated tether <b>16</b> has a first end <b>18</b> and a second end <b>20</b>. The first end <b>18</b> is attached to the loop <b>14</b>. The second end <b>20</b> may be attached to an object <b>7</b> to ensure that the ring member <b>12</b> is not lost during its use.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">In use, the ring member <b>12</b> is positioned over an end of a fishing rod <b>6</b>. The ring member <b>12</b> holds fishing line <b>8</b>, which is strung through the fishing rod <b>6</b>, adjacent to the fishing rod <b>6</b> after it extends away from the fishing rod <b>6</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, the ring member <b>12</b> is moved upwardly on the fishing rod <b>6</b> when the fishing line <b>8</b> is pulled outwardly away from the fishing rod <b>6</b>. This happens when a fish <b>9</b> begins take up the slack in the fishing line <b>8</b>. The ring member <b>12</b> falls away from the fishing rod <b>6</b> once it reaches the end of the fishing rod <b>6</b>. The ring member <b>12</b>, by its movement, indicates to the user of the fishing rod <b>6</b> that a fish <b>9</b> has taken the fishing line <b>8</b> before the fishing rod <b>12</b> bends.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1635" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention relates to fishing rods and, in particular, to a rod blank suspended within a rod handle and having a ferrule switch mounted to the rod handle and a vibrator mounted to the rod blank to induce vibrating movement to a suspend fishing line and lure.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">A common fishing technique is to jig a rod up and down from several inches to several feet in a preferred sequence to cause a suspended lure to correspondingly rise and fall with a fluttering action that initiates an injured prey species. Such movements attract fish and can induce active or feeding fish to strike. A variety of devices have therefore been developed to support and jig or manipulate a fishing rod up and down, for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,401,380; 4,251,939; 4,100,695; 4,020,582.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">A variety of other devices have been developed to jig or manipulate a fishing line up and down, for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,821,948; 4,528,767; 4,420,900; 4,349,978; 4,120,112; 3,981,095; 3,789,534; 3,600,837; 2,908,103; 2,783,576; and 2,746,198.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">U.S. Pat. No. 4,700,501 discloses a battery-powered device that simultaneously vibrates the rod blank and a suspended fishing line.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Although active jigging actions can be productive with active, feeding fish, a continuing problem is enticing a neutral or generally inactive fish into striking a presented bait. A neutral fish may merely swim in place and inspect the lure or bait. On such occasions, a fisherman can sometimes manually manipulate the lure with subtle vibrations, and/or with subtle changes to the lure's elevation, to induce a strike.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">The present invention was developed to provide a modular assembly that can be adapted to any fishing rod, although finds particular application with relatively short ice fishing rods. Preferably the rod is constructed with a floating rod blank; that is, the rod blank is substantially free to move and vibrate within a support handle. A ferrule switch mounts to a suspended portion of the handle and within which a battery power source is manipulated as a switch contact. A motor and a driven eccentric weight are supported to the rod blank forward of the handle to induce vibration in the rod blank, line and suspended lure.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1670" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">It is a primary object of the invention to provide a modularly configured, vibrating fishing rod.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">It is further object of the invention to provide a fishing rod wherein the rod blank mounts in substantial floating suspension to the handle.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">It is further object of the invention to provide a ferrule switch assembly that attaches to a rod handle and manipulates a battery power source as a switch contact.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">It is a further object of the invention to provide a vibrator having a motor and eccentric weight in a housing having a clip fastener that attaches to the rod blank.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">It is a further object of the invention to provide a switch having timing control over the vibrator whereby a fisherman can select desired periods of operation.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">The foregoing objects, advantages and distinctions of the invention are obtained in a presently preferred ice fishing rod. The rod blank is mounted in substantial, concentric, floating suspension to a bore of the handle and is minimally secured to the handle at a proximal end. A two-piece, ferrule switch housing is fitted to a fore-end of the rod handle and a battery power source is spring biased as a switch contact. A motor and driven eccentric weight are supported in a housing having a clip fastener that attaches to the rod blank distal of the handle. The separation between the motor and anchor point of the rod blank to the handle are selected to enhance rod blank vibrations. Selective manual manipulation of the fishing rod and operation of the switch enhance lure presentation for active and neutral fish.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">Still other objects, advantages, distinctions and constructions and combinations of individual features of the invention will become more apparent from the following description with respect to the appended drawings. Similar components and assemblies are referred to in the various drawings with similar alphanumeric reference characters. The description therefore should not be literally construed in limitation of the invention. Rather, the invention should be interpreted within the broad scope of the further, appended claims.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1798" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a perspective drawing is shown to a typical ice fishing rod <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an open water fishing rod. The principal difference between ice rods and open water rods is rod length. Ice fishing rods typically extend 24-inches to 48-inches, whereas open freshwater water rods are much longer and can extend 5-feet to 10-feet. Shore fishing rods (e.g. telescoping poles might extend 15-feet to 20-feet. Saltwater rod length varies depending upon the species and fishing technique (e.g. shore or boat).</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">The rod <b>2</b>, regardless of length, consists of a tapered rod blank <b>4</b> that is mounted to a handle <b>6</b>. The rod blank <b>4</b> can be constructed of a variety of conventional fiberglass, graphite and composite materials. A number of line guides <b>8</b> are secured to the blank <b>4</b> with windings of wrapped thread that are sealed with an epoxy. A pair of annular rings secure a fishing reel <b>11</b> containing a length of fishing line <b>9</b> to the handle <b>6</b>. The reel <b>11</b> can vary in construction (e.g. open or closed face spin casting, bait casting etc.) depending upon the type of handle <b>6</b> and eyes <b>8</b> provided at the rod <b>4</b>. The reel <b>11</b> can also be secured directly to the handle <b>6</b> with tape (e.g. as with the fishing rod of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) or at a pre-formed reel seat having at least one sliding collar piece to restrain the reel <b>11</b> to the handle <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">A ferrule switch assembly <b>12</b> is secured to the fore-end of the handle <b>6</b> and a motorized vibrator <b>14</b> is mounted to the rod blank <b>4</b> approximately 6 to 12-inches from the switch <b>12</b>. One or more wrapped conductors <b>16</b> extend between the switch <b>12</b> and vibrator <b>14</b> and/or the conductor <b>16</b> can provide a sheath that includes multiple conductors. The length of the conductors <b>16</b> can be varied as desired to obtain a desired separation (i.e. lever arm) between the vibrator <b>14</b> and an anchoring point of the rod blank <b>4</b> to the handle <b>6</b>; the greater the separation between the vibrator <b>14</b> and anchor point, the larger the period of oscillating movement at the lure. The conductors <b>16</b> can be wrapped about the blank <b>4</b> or might mount within the blank <b>4</b>. Conductive stripes might also be adhered or plated onto the blank or conductors even be cast into the rod blank <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">A pushbutton <b>18</b> is conveniently located in relation to the handle <b>4</b> and is normally mounted forward of the open-face spinning reel <b>11</b> to permit the selective actuation of the vibrator <b>14</b> in relation to normal fishing actions. For example, the line <b>9</b> and a suspended lure of preferred size and color can be vibrated between intermittent jigging actions to cause the lure to vibrate as it falls and flutters. Alternatively, the line <b>9</b> and lure might only be vibrated when the lure is held suspended at a constant depth. The jigging action and vibration can thus be selectively tailored by the fisherman to the existing fishing conditions and each fish.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">With attention to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref>, details are apparent to the construction and operation of the ferrule switch <b>12</b> and vibrator <b>14</b>. The switch <b>12</b> includes upper and lower cover pieces <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> that snap together over the fore end of the handle <b>6</b>. The pushbutton <b>18</b> is constructed of an exposed rubber piece <b>24</b> that is fitted to a cap <b>26</b>. The negative terminal of a DC watch-type battery <b>28</b> is supported by the rubber piece <b>24</b> in contact with a resilient, arcuately bent portion <b>30</b> of a positive contact terminal <b>32</b>. The bent terminal portion <b>30</b> elevates the battery <b>28</b> above a negative contact terminal <b>34</b> and resiliently biases movement of the battery <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">The conductors <b>16</b> connect the contact terminals <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> to the vibrator <b>14</b>. Depression of the rubber piece <b>24</b> depresses the battery <b>28</b> until the sidewall of the positive &#x201c;+&#x201d; battery terminal contacts the terminal <b>34</b> which causes current to flow to the vibrator <b>14</b> so long as contact is maintained. A switch action is thus obtained with minimal parts that might be affected by a cold and/or moist marine environment. It is to be appreciated that relays and/or timing circuits (e.g. multi-position switches or a potentiometer) can be included at the switch <b>12</b> to provide several discrete continuous or intermittent or variable vibrating motions and/or initiate other electronic functions.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a potentiometer based timer controller <b>35</b> that might be included at the switch <b>12</b>. The type of control coupled to the switch <b>12</b> can be varied to accommodate the associated timer and/or frequency control circuitry mounted between the covers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> to establish a preferred period and frequency of operation of the motor <b>56</b>. That is, the circuitry can control the period of operation of the motor and/or the speed of motor rotation. A conventional pushbutton might also be substituted for the present pushbutton <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Pronged tangs <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> at the lower cover <b>20</b> project and mate with flanged cavities <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> in the upper cover <b>22</b>. Gussets <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> project from the lower and upper covers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> to maintain the proper alignment of the cover pieces <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. Recessed channels <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are defined to assure that the covers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> do not contact the rod blank <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">With attention to FIG. <b>2</b> and also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the rod blank <b>4</b> is concentrically displaced at the handle <b>6</b> from a core piece <b>46</b>. That is, a space <b>48</b> is provided that extends substantially the entire length of the handle <b>6</b>. Similarly, the rod blank <b>4</b> is displaced from the ferrule switch <b>12</b>. A suitable material is mounted over the core piece <b>46</b>, such as cork or foam sleeve <b>50</b> that is gripped by the fisherman. The rod blank <b>4</b> is secured with a suitable filler piece <b>52</b> that is concentrically mounted in the space <b>48</b> and bound with an epoxy to the core piece <b>46</b> over approximately the last 25% of the handle <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">The blank <b>4</b> is thus free to oscillate in the gap or core space <b>48</b> that is provided in the handle <b>6</b>. An enhanced lever arm is thus obtained between the motorized vibrator <b>14</b> and the anchoring filler piece <b>52</b> that is not available with conventional fishing rods, and wherein the handles are anchored over there entire length, particularly at the fore and aft ends, to the rod blank <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">The vibrator <b>14</b> is shown in exploded assembly at FIG. <b>3</b>. The vibrator <b>14</b> consists of housing sections <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> that surround a motor <b>56</b> and an eccentric weight <b>58</b> secured to the drive shaft of the motor <b>56</b>. An open sided channel piece or &#x201c;C&#x201d;-shaped clip <b>60</b> secures the vibrator <b>14</b> to the rod blank <b>4</b>. Rotation of the eccentric weight <b>58</b> induces oscillations in the rod blank <b>4</b>, which oscillations are exaggerated by the relatively long lever arm due to the unsupported mounting of the rod blank <b>4</b> inside the handle <b>6</b>. That is, the additional length of unsupported rod blank <b>4</b> between the vibrator <b>14</b> and filler piece <b>52</b> produces movements of a supported bait or lure of &#x215b; to &#xbd;-inch depending upon the length of the rod blank <b>4</b>. Without the increased lever arm length in the handle <b>6</b>, such as merely mounting the motor <b>56</b> to a conventional rod blank <b>4</b> that is rigidly secured over the full length of a handle <b>6</b>, the oscillations would be relatively tight and not cause a supported bait to discernibly move to and fro.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> depict alternative mountings of a motorized vibrator <b>14</b> to the tip or fore-end of a typical open water fishing rod <b>3</b>. The vibrator <b>14</b> is shown secured to the rod blank <b>4</b> aft and slightly forward of the forward most line guide <b>8</b>. In lieu of providing a conductor <b>16</b> that extends along the relatively long exterior surface of the blank <b>4</b>, the conductor <b>16</b> extends beneath the handle <b>6</b> and through the bore of the hollow rod blank <b>4</b>. In particular, the conductor <b>16</b> extends along the space <b>48</b> and through a channel <b>64</b> formed at the filler piece <b>52</b>. The conductor <b>16</b> is then routed into the bore of the blank <b>4</b> and out the tip of the blank <b>4</b>. The integrity of the blank <b>4</b> is thereby not compromised such as by boreholes to accommodate conductor routing, which can be especially problematic if let into the tip section as alternatively shown at the rod tip in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5. A</figref> butt cap <b>66</b> is typically fitted to cover the end of the handle <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">While the invention has been described with respect to presently preferred combinational assemblies and considered improvements or alternatives thereto, still other assemblies and arrangements may be suggested to those skilled in the art. It is also to be appreciated that the foregoing vibrator and ferrule switch can be used singularly or can be arranged in different combinations with any type of fresh water and salt water spin casting, bait casting rods and even fly casting rods to provide a variety of improved rods. The vibrator <b>14</b> may also be mounted within the bore of relatively large diameter saltwater rod blanks. The battery may also be secured to the rod without acting as a switch contact. The foregoing description should therefore be construed to include all those embodiments within the spirit and scope of the following claims.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="heading-d0e655" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention relates to fishing hooks and, in particular, to hooks selectively outfitted with a dressing retainer for securing attractors to the hook (e.g. artificial plastic tails, tubes etc. or live bait), and/or a retainer that accepts a rattle, cyalume stick or secondary weight and/or a weight that can be adjustably positioned along the hook shank.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">A longstanding problem of fishermen who use plastic lure dressings or attractors (e.g. plastic tails, tubes with filamentary tentacles and other molded artificial baits that mimic the appearance of live bait) is obtaining a secure attachment of the artificial bait to a fishhook. Many attractors attach directly to the hook by threading the hook through the body of the attractor. This attachment subjects the attractors to wear and tear that causes the attractor to rotate, slip and dislodge from the hook. The attractor must therefore be continually attended and repositioned or replaced.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">A variety of retainers have been developed to facilitate dressing retention. Some retainers depend from the shank of the hook and some depend from the eye of the hook. Among the former retainers, several retainers provide members that are molded to the hook and have protruding prongs and ridges over which the attractor is threaded and that prevent retraction of the attractor. The shank of the hook can also be formed with burrs, slivers or other barbed protrusions to prevent slippage.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Several of the eye supported retainers provide formed pieces having outer surfaces shaped to discourage retraction. The retainers are either rigidly secured to the hook or are mounted to pivot freely. The attractor is typically threaded onto the hook and the retainer is separately threaded into the attractor to support the attractor at a preferred orientation to the hook. A weedless, antifouling mounting of the attractor is oftentimes obtainable with these retainers. That is, the several attractor attachment points permit a limited obstruction of the gap between the hook eye and tip of the hook barb, which allows the assembly to slide more readily through weeds and other obstructions.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">A variety of audible attractors, rattles, lights and cyalume sticks have also been developed that can be mounted to the attractor or attached directly to the hook. Some rattles are constructed to insert into the attractor; others are constructed to attach to the hook or other lure parts with rubber bands, tubing or looped elastomer members. Alone or collectively, the visual attractor dressings and audible attractors can stimulate a prey species of fish to strike the lure.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">A variety of hooks also exist that are constructed with permanently located weights. Weights of various sizes (e.g. {fraction (1/16)}-&#xbe; ounce) and shapes are rigidly cast onto the hook shank at locations that promote a desired hook orientation during retrieval. The variety of weight sizes requires the fisherperson to stock a selection of the various sizes. Some &#x201c;bottom bouncers&#x201d; provide weights that are pegged or stopped along a wire form with a rubber band.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The present invention was developed to provide a modular hook assembly. The hook is constructed to support a weight that can be re-positioned along the hook shank to define a desired hook orientation. A formed wire dressing retainer is also provided that depends from the hook eye to support desired plastic attractors. A formed spring wire retainer is also provided that is shaped to support a rattle, weight, and/or cyalume stick. Depending upon a desired arrangement of enhancements, a hook can be accoutered and adapted to complement a broad range of fishing conditions without having to stock a host of special fishing lures.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e695" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">It is a primary object of the invention to provide a modularly configured hook assembly capable of supporting artificial visual, audible attractors and/or other accessories from a hook outfitted with an adjustable weight.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">It is further object of the invention to provide a hook having a weight member cast to the hook that can be reciprocally adjusted and re-positioned along the shank of the hook.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">It is further object of the invention to provide a hook having a notched weight member cast over a sleeve that compressively grips the hook shank and wherein a notch extends the range of weight motion along the hook shank and prevents weight rotation about the hook shank.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">It is a further object of the invention to provide a hook having a formed wire retainer secured to pivot at the hook eye or other lure aperture and which retainer mounts in an artificial dressing or attractor body or live bait.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">It is further object of the invention to provide a formed spring wire retainer that attaches to a hook and includes a spiral bore wherein a rattle, light, weight or other accessory mounts.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">The foregoing objects, advantages and distinctions of the invention are obtained in a modularly constructed, weighted hook assembly that can be configured with singular or combinational arrangements of available attractor and accessory retainers. A shaped weight member is mounted to the shank of the hook and the mounting position of which can be adjusted to vary the orientation of the hook when falling or retrieved. The weight member is cast over a sleeve that compressively grips the hook shank. The weight includes a notch or groove that extends the range of weight motion along the hook shank and prevents weight rotation. A weight having a full-length notch in the weight and the sleeve permit changing the hook weight.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">A wire formed artificial attractor retainer mounts to the hook eye to secure a variety of molded plastic attractors or live bait to the hook. A looped section attaches to the eye and a serpentine section penetrates and retains an attractor piece to the hook. Independent penetration with multiple serpentine bends prevents attractor rotation.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">A second wire formed accessory retainer is adapted to selectively attach and detach from the hook and retain an audible attractor, cyalume stick or battery/LED light, secondary weight or other compatible accessory to the hook. The retainer includes an open-looped section that clips onto the hook. A trailing spiral wound section includes a bore that accepts the head of a rattle chamber or other appliance (e.g. a weight, cyalume stick or light) that is screwed into the bore.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">In still other constructions, the weights and attractor and accessory retainers can be selectively used alone or in desired combinations. The retainers can be secured to a weighted or un-weighted hook and/or a rattle, cyalume stick, secondary weight or other accessory can be secured to a hook without an attractor.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">Still other objects, advantages, distinctions and constructions of the invention will become more apparent from the following description with respect to the appended drawings. Similar components and assemblies are referred to in the various drawings with similar alphanumeric reference characters. The description therefore should not be literally construed in limitation of the invention. Rather, the invention should be interpreted within the broad scope of the further appended claims.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e799" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a perspective drawing is shown in partial cutaway to a modular hook assembly <b>2</b> of the invention outfitted with a tube-type attractor <b>4</b>, a detachable rattle assembly <b>6</b> and an adjustable weight <b>8</b> positioned at a forward position along the shank <b>10</b> of a hook <b>12</b>. The attractor <b>4</b> can take a variety of forms, for example, tubes with filamentary tentacles (as shown), plastic worms or other artificial baits that mimic the appearance of live bait and are molded from soft plastics, rubber and the like. The assembly <b>2</b> defines an artificial lure that is fished submerged through weeds or wood and/or along selected submerged structure where fish concentrate.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The attractor <b>4</b> is secured to the hook <b>12</b> with an attractor retainer <b>14</b> that is mounted to a hook eye <b>16</b>. The attractor <b>4</b> is separately secured to the hook barb <b>18</b>. The barb <b>18</b> can either be exposed (as shown) or mount inside a hollow bore <b>20</b> of the tube attractor <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">The retainer <b>14</b> is substantially embedded into the soft material of the attractor <b>4</b> and is formed to prevent the attractor <b>4</b> from rotating or withdrawing. With the barb <b>18</b> concealed in the attractor <b>4</b>, the retainer <b>14</b> and attractor <b>4</b> create a weed less presentation that prevents weeds and other water borne materials from collecting in the gap between the barb <b>18</b> and shank <b>10</b>. The attractor material is sufficiently soft such that the barb <b>18</b> can pierce the attractor <b>4</b> and penetrate a fish's mouth, when the lure <b>2</b> is struck by a fish.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">The retainer <b>14</b> is constructed of a metal wire that is shaped to provide a closed or open-looped section <b>22</b> that attaches to the eye <b>16</b>. A serpentine section <b>24</b> depends from the section <b>22</b> and includes convoluted bends <b>23</b> and <b>23</b>&#x2032; that resist withdrawal or rotation of the attractor <b>4</b>. A distal tip <b>26</b> is bent to facilitate penetration of the attractor <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">The section <b>24</b> exhibits a &#x201c;Z&#x201d; shape, although can be bent to a variety of other planar or 3-dimensional shapes, including a spiral. The looped section <b>22</b> can be bent to provide any shape that accommodates a detachable mounting of the retainer <b>14</b> to the hook eye <b>16</b> or sundry other apertures or eyelets at a lure (e.g. a split ring or spinner blade or lure body) with which the retainer <b>14</b> might be used. The retainer <b>14</b> can also be used to secure live bait to the hook <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">With additional attention to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which depicts a curly tail attractor <b>27</b> in dashed line, the rattle assembly <b>6</b> is separately attached to the hook <b>12</b> and trails from the interior of the bore <b>20</b>. The assembly <b>6</b> comprises a retainer piece <b>28</b> and a purchased rattle <b>30</b>. The rattle <b>30</b> includes a rattle housing <b>32</b> that contains a pair of balls <b>34</b> that are secured within the housing <b>32</b> by an end ball <b>36</b>. A stem piece <b>38</b> projects from the housing <b>32</b> to a head <b>40</b>. The head <b>40</b> screws into the bore <b>42</b> of a spiral wound section <b>44</b> of the retainer <b>28</b> and is held in place by the compressive force exerted by the windings <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">An open-loop section <b>46</b> of the retainer <b>28</b> snap mounts over the barb <b>18</b> and is sized to freely move along the barb <b>18</b> such that the rattles <b>34</b> can move within the housing <b>32</b> with movement of the lure <b>2</b>. The looped section <b>46</b> can also mount to the eye <b>16</b> or any other available aperture at a lure with which the retainer <b>28</b> might be used. The looped section <b>46</b>, like the looped section <b>22</b>, can be constructed to any desired shape that provides a secure mounting.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">A secondary weight <b>48</b> or a CYALUME&#xae; cyalume stick <b>49</b>, battery/LED light, among other lure accessories, can also be mounted to the section <b>28</b>. Any such accessory should have a headpiece <b>40</b> or body shape that is compatible for insertion into and retention by the wound section <b>44</b>. One or more retainers <b>28</b> and rattles <b>30</b>, CYALUME&#xae; sticks <b>49</b>, weights <b>48</b> or other accessories can be mounted to a lure.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">With additional attention to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, positioned along the shank <b>10</b> of the hook is the sliding weight <b>8</b>. The size (e.g. {fraction (1/16)} to &#xbe; ounce) and shape (e.g. ovaloid, ellipsoid, or spheroid, among other shapes, and may include wings or flat surfaces) of the weight <b>8</b> can be varied to accommodate the hook <b>12</b> and application. The weight <b>8</b> is permanently cast to the hook <b>12</b> over a silicone sleeve <b>50</b>, which is shown in cross section at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. A bore <b>52</b> of the sleeve <b>50</b> is sized to mate with and compressively grip the hook shank <b>10</b>. The sleeve <b>50</b> typically includes a longitudinal slit <b>58</b> to facilitate mounting the sleeve <b>50</b> to the hook <b>12</b>, prior to casting the weight <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">The sleeve <b>50</b> permits the weight <b>8</b> to be moved to and fro along the shank <b>10</b> to adjust the hydrodynamics of the lure <b>2</b>. Several different mounting positions of the weight <b>8</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The adjustment of the weight <b>8</b> controls the rate of fall and/or causes the weight <b>8</b> to act like a keel to vary the angle of the lure <b>2</b> when retrieved. The weight <b>8</b> can be adjusted to provide a &#x201c;wobble&#x201d; effect during active retrieval with a reel or a gliding effect such as when jigged. The sleeve <b>50</b> can be constructed of a variety of materials (e.g. silicone or rubber) to a variety of shapes, provided a compressive and movable attachment is obtained with the shank <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">The weight <b>8</b> might also be cast directly to the shank <b>10</b> between a pair of adjustable rubber sleeves or O'rings or may provide an opening to receive a peg to fix the location of the weight at the shank <b>10</b>. A rubber insert that lies parallel to the shank might also be cast into the weight <b>8</b> to facilitate a restricted movement of the weight <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">A longitudinal notch, kerf or groove <b>54</b> is let into the weight <b>8</b>. The notch <b>54</b> can be rotated down when the weight <b>8</b> is located at the forward and middle sections of the shank <b>10</b>. When the notch <b>54</b> is rotated up, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the weight <b>8</b> can be extended to an aft most position to slow the rate of fall. The length of the notch <b>54</b> can be varied as desired. The notch <b>54</b> might also extend the full length of the weight (as shown in dashed line at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and align with the full-length longitudinal slit <b>58</b> in the sleeve <b>50</b>. A weight <b>8</b> having a full-length notch <b>54</b> and slit <b>58</b> allows the weight <b>8</b> to be changed. Alternatively, the retainer <b>28</b> can be used to secure an additional weight <b>48</b> to a lure.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a central mounting of the weight <b>8</b>. It also depicts an alternative attractor retainer <b>56</b> secured to the eye <b>16</b> and which retainer is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,405,477. The retainer <b>56</b> can be used in lieu of the retainer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">While the invention has been described with respect to a preferred combinational assembly and considered improvements or alternatives thereto, still other assemblies and rigging arrangements may be suggested to those skilled in the art. It is also to be appreciated that the foregoing retainers <b>14</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>56</b>, attractors <b>4</b>, weights <b>8</b> and <b>48</b> and cyalume stick <b>49</b> can be used singularly or can be arranged in different combinations to provide a variety of improved lures. The foregoing description should therefore be construed to include all those embodiments within the spirit and scope of the following claims.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">A floating fishing lure having the capability to adjust the buoyancy of the fish lure with a high degree of precision, such that the fish lure has fore and aft chamber sections connected and held together by an attaching means. Disposed on each fore and aft chamber sections are a plurality of buoyancy windows, one set of which will coincidentally overlie the other set of buoyancy windows as the fore chamber section is rotationally moved in regard to the aft chamber section. By changing the rotational placement of the two sections, valve aperture openings are produced that regulate the air to water ratio within the fish lure, thereby controlling its buoyancy. Additional fish attractors, hooks and illuminators can be added to the fishing lure.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e2425" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention relates to an adjustable buoyancy floating fish lure having remote and manual buoyancy adjustments to vary the buoyancy of the fish lure, thereby controlling the water depth the fish lure will attain. The fish lure of the present invention comprises a fore and aft chamber held together by an attaching means and the buoyancy of the fish lure is adjusted by the relative rotation between the fore and aft chambers. The present invention is not limited to a fishing lure, but can also be used to control and maintain the depth of live bait and other lures.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e2435" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">Fishing floatation devices have been used for centuries, utilizing cork objects and wood attached to fishing line to serve as bobbers. Such types of bobbers reside on the water surface and are desirable for preventing the hook from becoming caught or snared on the bottom of the body of water. Although conventional bobbers prevent the hooks from catching on rocks or trees located under the surface of the water, their cumbersome size and color is often undesirable to fish. Additionally, since bait typically extends directly beneath the bobber, the hook setting capability is extremely undesirable, in that when a fisherman sets the hook by lifting his/her rod, the bobber moves first before the hook is set. This premature movement of the bobber prior to setting the hook can scare fish away from the hook.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Additionally, fishing sinkers have also been used for many years and are advantageous for casting long distances and preventing the current of moving water from displacing fishing bait from a desired location. Although fishing sinkers have some desirable features, sinkers typically pull the fishing bait or lure to the bottom of the body of water, often causing either or both the sinker and hook to snare or catch against rocks, submerged vegetation, or other various obstacles, which is undesirable.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Other conventional fishing devices have a predetermined buoyancy, but are typically undesirable to fisherman, since the fisherman must keep a large number of these devices in the tackle box due to uncertainty of the needed buoyancy. Also conventional fishing devices for controlling the depth and floatation of live bait or lures have been developed to have buoyancy adjustments to control the depth of the bait or lure in the water, but are often cumbersome, require a large number of complex and cumbersome components, are expensive to manufacture, and their respective appearances repel fish.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Thus, there is a need to provide a fishing device which prevents the hook of the bait or lure from catching on rocks or submerged vegetation on the bottom of bodies of water, is of a discrete size, has a desirable natural appearance for fish, is multi-functional in that it can float on top of the water, sink to the bottom and achieve any depth between the bottom and surface of the body of water, with an easily adjustable buoyancy which can be adjusted remotely, is inexpensive to manufacture, and attracts fish.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e2460" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">The present invention is directed to a fish lure having buoyancy adjustments and comprising fore and aft chambers connected to one another by an attaching means within the body of the fish lure. The fore and aft chambers are rotatable about a central axis and the attaching means is disposed on that central axis through the body of the fish lure. The relative rotation of the fore and aft chambers will vary the buoyancy of the fish lure. The fore chamber includes a first set of a plurality of buoyancy windows and the aft chamber includes a second set of a plurality of buoyancy windows, such that the first and second set of buoyancy windows are relatively adjustable with respect to one another to create a set of a plurality of valve apertures controlling the air to water ratio within the body of the fish lure.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">Additionally, the fish lure of the present invention has buoyancy adjustments comprising fore and aft chambers connected to one another by an attaching means, wherein the fore and aft chambers as well as the attaching means are coaxial with each other about a central axis and a first set of a plurality of buoyancy windows are disposed on and around the circumference of a first end of the aft chamber and a second set of a plurality of buoyancy windows are disposed on and around the circumference of a second end of the fore chamber, wherein the first and second set of buoyancy windows are relatively adjustable to one another to create a set of a plurality of valve apertures controlling the air to water ratio within the fish lure. Additionally, the fore chamber comprises a first annular serrated locking means having a first set of a plurality of angled teeth and the aft chamber comprises a second annular serrated locking means having a second set of a plurality of angled teeth, wherein the first and second sets of annular teeth engage each other to lock the fore and aft chambers in a preferred respective position.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the attaching means connecting and holding together the fore and aft chambers is a hollow elastic tube having first and second ends, wherein the fore and aft chambers are held together by rotating the elastic tube about the central axis. Since the hollow elastic tube is disposed on and extends along the central axis, a fishing line continuously extends through the hollow elastic tube on and along the central axis through the body of the fish lure. Both the fore and aft chambers of the fish lure are made of a transparent and colorless plastic.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">In a second embodiment of the present invention the attaching means includes a threaded end cap and a hollow rod having first and second ends, the first end has a threaded protrusion and the second end includes an annular flange unit and threaded end cap which rotatably engages the threaded protrusion to connect the fore and aft chambers together. To attract nearby fish, an illumination means can be inserted into the hollow rod. Similar to the fish lure of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fore and aft chambers are made of transparent and colorless plastic as well as the threaded end cap and hollow rod to produce a covert natural appearance to fish.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e2603" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The following detailed descriptions are for the best presently contemplated modes of carrying out the present invention. These descriptions are not intended in any limiting sense, but rather are made solely for the purposes of illustrating the general principles of the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">Referring now to the drawings in detail, wherein like numerals indicate like elements, there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an adjustable buoyancy floating fish lure <b>10</b> having fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> embodying the principles of the present invention. Each chamber section <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> is coaxially disposed around a central axis <b>15</b> extending entirely through the central portion or chamber <b>17</b> of the adjustable buoyancy floating fish lure <b>10</b>. An elastic tubing <b>13</b>, such as a rubber surgical tube having a hollow interior bore connects the distal ends of the fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> such that the elastic tubing <b>13</b> extends through the central chamber of body <b>17</b> of the fish lure.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">The fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> are preferably made of a transparent and colorless plastic. The light weight of the plastic, and the absence of color, permits the fish lure of the present invention to display a covert natural appearance within the water. A first end <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the elastic tubing <b>13</b> is affixed to the fore chamber section <b>20</b> by a first rivet <b>12</b><i>a </i>which is inserted into an opening within the fore chamber section wall <b>22</b>. The first end <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the elastic tubing <b>13</b> is disposed around and between the rivet <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the fore chamber section wall <b>22</b> of the opening in the fore chamber section <b>20</b>. As such, when the rivet is fully inserted into the opening in the fore chamber section wall <b>22</b>, the rivet <b>12</b><i>a </i>presses the elastic tubing <b>13</b> against the fore chamber section wall <b>22</b> of the opening in the fore chamber section <b>20</b>, thereby securely holding the elastic tubing <b>13</b> in the desired position. Likewise, a second end <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the elastic tubing <b>13</b> is affixed to the aft chamber section <b>30</b> by a second rivet <b>12</b><i>b </i>which is inserted into an opening within the fore chamber section wall <b>32</b>. The second end <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the elastic tubing <b>13</b> is disposed around and between the rivet <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the aft chamber section wall <b>32</b> of the opening in the aft chamber section <b>30</b>. As such, when the rivet <b>12</b><i>b </i>is fully inserted into the opening in the aft chamber section wall <b>32</b>, the rivet <b>12</b><i>b </i>presses the elastic tubing <b>13</b> against the aft chamber section wall <b>32</b> of the opening in the aft chamber section <b>30</b>, thereby securely holding the elastic tubing <b>13</b> in the desired position.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">Upon connecting the fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> by way of the elastic tubing <b>13</b>, a fishing line <b>11</b> is threaded entirely through the hollow interior of the elastic tubing <b>13</b> and first and second rivets <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b</i>, respectively. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, first fishing line section <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the fishing line extends towards the fisherman or the fishing rod and reel assembly (not shown) and a second fishing line section <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the fishing line extends towards a hook or additional fishing lure.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">Positioned around the circumference of the fore chamber section <b>20</b> of the present invention are buoyancy windows <b>21</b><i>a-d </i>preferably being circular in shape and extending entirely through the fore chamber section wall <b>22</b>. Each buoyancy window is positioned along the fore chamber section wall <b>22</b> at equally spaced distances so that each buoyancy window <b>21</b><i>a-d </i>is separated 90 degrees along the circumference from the next buoyancy window. Thus, buoyancy windows <b>21</b><i>a-d </i>are equidistantly spaced about the fore chamber section wall <b>22</b> at angles of 90, 180, 270 and 360 degrees when measured about the central axis <b>15</b>. Similarly, buoyancy windows <b>31</b><i>a-d </i>of the aft chamber section <b>30</b> are equidistantly spaced about the aft chamber section wall <b>32</b> at angles of 90, 180, 270 and 360 degrees when measured about the central axis <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">A critical feature of the present invention is the corresponding relationship between the buoyancy windows <b>21</b><i>a-d </i>of the fore chamber section <b>20</b> and the buoyancy windows <b>31</b><i>a-d </i>of the aft chamber section <b>30</b> so as to adjust the buoyancy of, or air to water ratio within, the floating fishing lure <b>10</b>. The variable buoyancy of the present invention is achieved when a buoyancy window, such as <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the fore chamber section <b>20</b> overlies the buoyancy window <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the aft chamber section <b>30</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, buoyancy window <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>a </i>completely coincide and overlie each other and, as such, both buoyancy windows are fully aligned to create aperture valves <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>having a maximum opening area. By setting the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>to have maximum opening areas, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the floating fish lure <b>10</b> of the present invention will take on water through the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>filling the interior chamber <b>17</b> with water and causing the fish lure <b>10</b> to sink beneath the surface of the water. Since buoyancy windows <b>21</b><i>a-d </i>and <b>31</b><i>a-d </i>are equidistantly spaced about the central axis <b>15</b>, the size of the valve aperture, or opening area, created by one of buoyancy windows of the fore chamber section <b>20</b> coinciding with the opening of a buoyancy window of the aft chamber section <b>30</b> will be of equal size for the other three remaining valve apertures.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">Alternatively, to increase the buoyancy of the fishing lure <b>10</b> of the present invention, the size or area of the aperture valves <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>must be reduced as clearly depicted in FIG. <b>4</b>. By reducing the size of the aperture valves, less water is accepted into the interior chamber <b>17</b> therefore allowing more air to remain within the interior chamber <b>17</b> so as to maintain a greater buoyancy. For instance, buoyancy window <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the fore chamber section <b>20</b> only partially overlies the buoyancy window <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the aft chamber section <b>30</b>, thereby creating a relatively small aperture valve <b>16</b><i>a </i>compared to the aperture valve as depicted in FIG. <b>3</b>. Although not shown in the drawings, to cause the fish lure <b>10</b> of the present invention to act as a bobber and always float on top of the surface of the water, the fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> may be positioned relative to each other so that none of the buoyancy windows <b>21</b><i>a-d </i>and <b>31</b><i>a-d </i>overlie one another, resulting in the valve apertures being closed. With the valve apertures closed, water is incapable of entering the interior chamber <b>17</b> and the air within the interior chamber is incapable of escaping, thereby the fish lure <b>10</b> of the present invention will float on top of the surface of the water.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">As described above, the fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> of the present invention are held in overlapping contact by elastic tubing <b>13</b>. The tubing <b>13</b> of the present invention has multiple advantages in that due to the hollow interior of the elastic tubing <b>13</b> the fishing line <b>11</b> can be completely inserted from the first end <b>13</b><i>a </i>to the second end <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the elastic tubing <b>13</b> and, by turning the fore chamber section <b>20</b> with respect to the aft chamber section <b>30</b>, thereby twisting the elastic tubing <b>13</b>, the fishing line <b>11</b> is captured and held in place within the elastic tubing <b>13</b> fixedly positioning the fish lure <b>10</b> at a predetermined distance along the fishing line <b>11</b>. A more critical feature of the elastic tube <b>13</b> is the ability to produce a contracting force to pull the fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> together by the twisting of the elastic tubing <b>13</b> about the central axis <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">Positioned on proximal end of the fore chamber section <b>20</b>, opposite the distal end where rivet <b>12</b><i>a </i>is located, is a first annular serrated locking means <b>25</b> disposed along the edge of and integrally formed as part of the fore chamber section wall <b>22</b>. The serrated locking means <b>25</b> extends outwardly away from the fore chamber section <b>20</b>. Similarly positioned on the proximal end of the aft chamber section wall <b>32</b>, opposite the distal end where rivet <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the buoyancy windows <b>31</b><i>a-d </i>are located, is a second annular serrated locking means <b>35</b> which also extends outwardly away from the aft chamber section <b>30</b>. Both first and second annular serrated locking means <b>25</b>, <b>35</b> have the same diameter relative to the central axis <b>15</b> and each have a set of a plurality of teeth <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>a </i>which extend outwardly away from the fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> at interlocking angles.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">Together with elastic tubing <b>13</b>, the first and second annular serrated locking means <b>25</b>, <b>35</b> enable a user to adjust the buoyancy of the fish lure <b>10</b> with a relatively high degree of precision. By increasing the number of teeth <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>a </i>extending around the first and second annular serrated locking means <b>25</b>, <b>35</b>; the precision of buoyancy can also be increased. Likewise, reducing the number of teeth of the annular serrated locking means reduces the adjustable precision of buoyancy adjustment. Although not shown in the drawings, indicia positioned around the circumference of the either the fore or aft chamber section <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> can conceivably be incorporated thereon to indicate degrees of buoyancy, thereby enabling the user to easily adjust to a desired buoyancy.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">The initial set up of the present invention begins with the insertion of the fishing line <b>11</b> into and through the elastic tubing <b>13</b>. Upon insertion of the fishing line <b>11</b> through the fish lure <b>10</b>, a user separates the fore chamber section <b>20</b> from the aft chamber section <b>30</b> by pulling each chamber in opposing directions along the central axis <b>15</b>. Once the fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> are separated, the elastic tubing <b>13</b> is twisted about the central axis <b>15</b> by rotating one of the fore or aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> relative to the other. Although the elastic tubing <b>13</b> can be twisted in an arbitrary direction, the tube is preferably twisted in such a direction so that the teeth <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the first annular serrated locking means <b>25</b> rotatably engage recesses between the teeth <b>35</b><i>a </i>of the second annular serrated locking means <b>35</b>. Thus, the elastic tubing <b>13</b> securely holds the fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> together by not only producing a contracting force caused by the twisting of elastic tubing <b>13</b>, which forces the fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> together, but also produces a rotational force about the central axis <b>15</b> for engaging teeth <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>a </i>of the serrated locking means <b>25</b>, <b>35</b> located respectively on the fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">An additional advantageous feature of the present invention is the method of manually, and remotely adjusting the buoyancy of the floating fish lure <b>10</b> of the present invention. Although the present invention is referred to as a floating fish lure <b>10</b>, it is not limited to such, since the present invention is a multi-functioning device, in that it facilitates the placement of other fishing lures and baits through its variable buoyancy. The floating fish lure <b>10</b> is able to function as a sinker, bobber or a buoyant facilitator to enable fishing lures and baits to attain any level of buoyancy equilibrium between the fish lure <b>10</b> and the ambient water, thereby producing a natural appearance and an adjustable level of depth in the water.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">As described above, the method of manually adjusting the degree of buoyancy is controlled by adjusting the coincident overlying relationship between the buoyancy windows <b>21</b><i>a-d </i>and <b>31</b><i>a-d </i>to produce the desired opening size of the aperture valves <b>16</b><i>a-d</i>, such that the larger the opening size of the aperture valves <b>16</b><i>a-d</i>, the less buoyant the fish lure <b>10</b>. Conversely, the smaller the opening size of the aperture valves <b>16</b><i>a-d</i>, the higher degree of buoyancy the fish lure <b>10</b> will attain. For instance, consider the case where the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>of the present invention are set to have a maximum opening. In this condition, upon casting the fish lure <b>10</b> into a body of water, the interior chamber <b>17</b> will fill with water causing the fish lure <b>10</b> to sink towards the bottom of the body of water due to the maximum sized valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>permitting the intake of a greater amount of water over a shorter time. Alternatively, consider the case where the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>of the present invention are closed thereby prohibiting any amount of water passing through the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>and into the interior chamber <b>17</b>. In this condition, the fish lure <b>10</b> will act as a bobber floating on the surface of the water. Located between these extreme conditions of the size of valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>either being fully open or completely closed, are a large number of degrees of buoyancy settings limited only by the number of teeth <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>a </i>of the first and second annular serrated locking means <b>25</b>, <b>35</b>. The buoyancy of the fish lure <b>10</b> is determined by the air to water ratio within the interior chamber <b>17</b>, such that the larger the amount of air, the more buoyant the fish lure becomes and conversely, the larger the amount of water versus air within the interior chamber <b>17</b>, the less buoyant the fish lure becomes. With the large number of degrees of buoyancy, a fisherman can choose just about any desired level of buoyancy.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">In the situation where the fisherman is aware that the fish are feeding near the bottom of the body of water, the fisherman would set the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>somewhere between maximum size and half-size. Continuing along the same manners of adjustments, through trial and error, the fisherman can attain the precise degree of desired buoyancy.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">An additional advantageous feature of the present invention is the method of remotely adjusting the buoyancy of the fish lure <b>10</b> while the figure lure <b>10</b> is within the water. In the situation where the fisherman is aware of the presence of fish feeding in the area, but is unaware of the particular depth the fish are located, a fisherman is capable of gradually reducing the buoyancy of the fish lure by remotely jerking or jigging the lure, which forces water through the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>and into the interior chamber <b>17</b>. This causes the air retained in the chamber <b>17</b> to bubble out and water to come into the chamber, thereby causing the fish lure <b>10</b> to sink to a slightly lower depth. For instance, with the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>partially closed, the fish lure <b>10</b> is cast out into a body of water. Upon landing on the surface of the water, the fish lure <b>10</b> floats on top of the surface of water acting as a bobber. If the fisherman is unsuccessful in receiving any strikes from fish, the fisherman simply lightly jerks or jigs the fish lure <b>10</b>, thereby forcing a small amount of water through the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>displacing and forcing air out of the chamber <b>17</b>. The newly added amount of water entering through the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>and into the interior chamber <b>17</b>, increases the weight of the fish lure <b>10</b>, thereby reducing the buoyancy to a small degree and causing the fish lure <b>10</b> to sink to a slightly lower depth beneath the surface of the water. Additional slight jerks or jigs cause a tipping of the fish lure <b>10</b> permitting more water into the interior chamber <b>17</b>, causing the fish lure to sink to an even slightly deeper depth. This procedure is carried out until the fisherman approximates the appropriate depth at which the fish are feeding. By refraining from severe motions on the fish lure <b>10</b>, the lure will tend to retain its current buoyant state.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">Alternatively, once the specific feeding depth is determined, the fisherman can retrieve the fish lure <b>10</b>, manually fill the interior chamber <b>17</b> with the appropriate amount of water to achieve the newly discovered degree of buoyancy for the fish lure. With the interior chamber <b>17</b> manually filled with water, the fisherman simply closes the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d</i>, thereby prohibiting the water from escaping out of the interior chamber <b>17</b> and again casts out into the body of water with the fish lure <b>10</b> set to the recently discovered degree of buoyancy.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">To aid the fisherman in determining the amount of water to add to the interior chamber <b>17</b> of the fish lure <b>10</b>, a first set of indicia markings (not shown) representing degrees of buoyancy are disposed on the aft chamber section <b>30</b> and serve as fill lines for the fisherman. To achieve a particular degree of buoyancy, the fisherman simply adds water to the interior chamber <b>17</b> of the aft chamber section <b>30</b> until the desired degree of buoyancy is attained. Similarly, a second set of indicia markings (not shown) may be also placed on either the fore or aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> to indicate degrees of buoyancy when adjusting the size of the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d</i>. Both first and second sets of indicia markings may be used together to determine the appropriate buoyancy required for the fish lure <b>10</b> to reach the desired feeding depth.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, the adjustable buoyancy floating fish lure <b>10</b> of the present invention can incorporate additional features to increase the desirability of the lure to fish. One such feature as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are noisemaking members <b>18</b><i>a </i>disposed within the interior chamber <b>17</b> of the fish lure <b>10</b>. These noisemaking member <b>18</b><i>a </i>are preferably made of plastic, but can conceivably be made of other various materials to aid in contributing to the production of potentially desirable noises, provided the noisemaking members <b>18</b><i>a </i>do not adversely affect the overall buoyancy of the fish lure <b>10</b>. To insert the noisemaking members <b>18</b><i>a </i>into the interior chamber <b>17</b> of the fish lure, fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> are separated and the noisemaking members <b>18</b><i>a </i>are inserted through the proximal opening <b>36</b> of the aft chamber section <b>30</b>. Upon movement of the fish lure <b>10</b> of the present invention, the noisemaking members contact both the fore and aft chamber section walls <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> to produce rattling noises which will attract the attention of nearby fish.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">Also used to attract the attention of fish are scent dispersing means <b>18</b><i>b </i>as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>. The scent dispersing means <b>18</b><i>b </i>may also be inserted into the interior chamber <b>17</b> of the fish lure <b>10</b>. A number of different types and materials of scent dispersing means <b>18</b><i>b </i>can be used within the fish lure <b>10</b> provided the scent dispersing means <b>18</b><i>b </i>do not adversely affect the intended functions of the fish lure <b>10</b>, such as its adjustable buoyancy. To insert the scent dispersing means <b>18</b><i>b </i>into the interior chamber <b>17</b> of the fish lure, fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> are separated and the scent dispersing means <b>18</b><i>b </i>may be inserted through the proximal opening <b>36</b> of the aft chamber section <b>30</b>. The scent from the scent dispersing means <b>18</b><i>b </i>emanating from within the interior chamber <b>17</b> of the fish lure <b>10</b> seeps out and through the aperture valves <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>and acts as a fish attractant for nearby fish.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, disposed within the interior chamber <b>17</b> of the fish lure <b>10</b> is a reflective attraction means <b>18</b><i>c </i>that acts to reflect light either in general, or predetermined patterns. A variety of different types of reflective attraction means <b>18</b><i>c </i>are conceivable, such as but not limited to, thin metallic film such as aluminum foil, stickers or paper mediums having reflective designs replicating fish scales disposed on a surface of the medium. To insert the reflective attraction means <b>18</b><i>c </i>into the interior chamber <b>17</b> of the fish lure, fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> are separated and the reflective attraction means <b>18</b><i>c </i>is inserted through the proximal aperture <b>36</b> of the aft chamber section <b>30</b>. Flashes of light caused by the slight movement of the fish lure <b>10</b> within the water attract the attention of nearby fish.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">Additional features can further be incorporated onto the fish lure <b>10</b> of the present invention to attract nearby fish, such as a skirt <b>19</b> that produces additional motion proximate to the fish lure <b>10</b>. The skirt <b>19</b> is disposed around rivet <b>12</b><i>b </i>on the distal end of aft chamber section <b>30</b> and extending outwardly and away from the fish lure <b>10</b>. In order to take advantage of the situation where a fish may strike the fish lure <b>10</b> of the present invention, a hook assembly <b>14</b> is attached along the outer surface of the aft chamber section <b>30</b>. Eyelet <b>14</b><i>a </i>can be affixed to aft chamber section <b>30</b> through conventional plastic welding means, or more preferably is made integrally as a unit with the aft chamber section <b>30</b> to assure a secure attachment. A conventional hook <b>14</b><i>c </i>is connected to the eyelet <b>14</b><i>a </i>through a link unit <b>14</b><i>b </i>that is of sufficient strength to prohibit breakage under normal fishing conditions. Although the above additional fish attraction features are described separately, such features can be used separately or together, or in any conceivable combination, to attract fish, provided that such combination of features enables the fish lure <b>10</b> to carry out its intended function of adjustable buoyancy.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref> illustrate the adjustable buoyancy floating fish lure <b>100</b> of the second embodiment of the present invention, wherein a hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> is centrally disposed through fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> that is held in position by threaded end cap <b>150</b>. The fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, as well as the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> and threaded end cap <b>150</b>, are all preferably made of a transparent and colorless plastic which, due to the light weight of plastic and the absence of color, permits the fish lure of the present invention to display a covert natural appearance beneath the surface of the water.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> of the second embodiment of the present invention has first and second ends <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Strategically positioned at the first end <b>140</b><i>a </i>of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> is a line attachment means <b>145</b>. Unlike the first embodiment of the present invention, fish lure <b>100</b> connects to the fishing line (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>) by way of a serrated gripping unit <b>145</b><i>b </i>of the line attachment means <b>145</b>. The fishing line is pressed against a resilient locking unit <b>145</b><i>a </i>that flexes inwardly toward the center of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b>. Upon flexing, the displacement of the resilient locking unit <b>145</b><i>a </i>creates a small gap between itself and rigid lip <b>145</b><i>c</i>, thereby enabling the fishing line to pass through the gap. After the fishing line passes through the gap, the resilient locking unit <b>145</b><i>a </i>returns to its initial position such that the resilient lock unit <b>145</b><i>a </i>abuts against the rigid lip <b>145</b><i>c </i>preventing the fishing line from escaping from the line attachment means <b>145</b>. The fishing line is then forced into the serrated gripping unit <b>145</b><i>b </i>of the attaching rod <b>140</b> so that the fishing lure <b>100</b> is securely held in position on the fishing line.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">The hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> of the present invention has an interior bore <b>146</b> disposed within the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> which is sized to house an illumination means <b>143</b>. The illumination means <b>143</b> can conceivably be any illumination source, provided the illumination source is capable of fitting within the interior bore <b>146</b> of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b>, remains illuminated for a sufficient period of time, for example one to two hours, and also does not adversely affect the adjustable buoyancy of the fish lure <b>100</b>. Preferably, the illumination source may be single use, or reusable light sticks. Placing them in low temperature environments, i.e. freezers, for future use, can reactivate the reusable light sticks <b>143</b>. Located at the second end <b>140</b><i>b </i>of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> is an annular flange <b>144</b> that is preferably made integrally with the hollow attaching member <b>140</b>. Although not clearly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, the annular flange <b>144</b> has a bore equal in diameter and coaxially aligned with the interior bore <b>146</b> of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b>. Illumination means <b>143</b>, being slightly smaller in diameter than the interior bore <b>146</b> of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b>, is pushed into the interior bore <b>146</b> to the desired depth, and snugly held within the interior bore <b>146</b> of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> by a frictional fit until removed.</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">The fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> of the second embodiment of the present invention are different than the fore and aft chamber sections <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> of first embodiment of present invention. The fore chamber section <b>120</b> and the aft chamber section <b>130</b> have coaxially first and second apertures <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b</i>, and <b>136</b><i>a</i>, <b>136</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Apertures <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b</i>, <b>136</b><i>a </i>and <b>136</b><i>b </i>enable the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> to initially pass through second then first apertures <b>136</b><i>b </i>and <b>136</b><i>a </i>on the aft chamber section <b>130</b> and extend towards and pass through the second then first apertures <b>126</b><i>b </i>and <b>126</b><i>a </i>of the fore chamber section <b>120</b>. Strategically positioned on the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b>, is a threaded portion <b>141</b> which protrudes through aperture <b>126</b><i>a </i>on the fore chamber section. When the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> is fully inserted through apertures <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b</i>, <b>136</b><i>a </i>and <b>136</b><i>b </i>of the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, about a central axis <b>115</b> of the fish lure <b>100</b>, the threaded portion <b>141</b> extends beyond the fore chamber section <b>120</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b>. Threaded end cap <b>150</b> having a bore sized to accommodate the first end <b>140</b><i>a </i>of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> is placed over the line attachment means <b>145</b> and slid down the attaching rod <b>140</b> to engage the threaded portion <b>141</b>. By rotating the threaded end cap <b>150</b> downward, the threaded portion <b>141</b> of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> directly engages the threads within the bore of the threaded end cap <b>150</b>. This action exerts a force not only upon an annular rim <b>124</b> positioned on the first end <b>120</b><i>a </i>of the fore chamber section <b>120</b>, but also on the second end <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the aft chamber section <b>130</b>, by way of annular flange unit <b>144</b> of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b>. As such, the rotation of the threaded end cap <b>150</b> forces both the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> into direct engagement within one another.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">Similar to the first embodiment of the present invention, positioned around the fore chamber section <b>120</b> of the second embodiment of the present invention are buoyancy windows <b>121</b><i>a-d </i>preferably being circular in shape and extending entirely through the fore chamber section wall <b>122</b>. Each buoyancy window <b>121</b><i>a-d </i>is positioned along the fore chamber section wall <b>122</b> at equally spaced distances around the periphery such that each buoyancy window <b>121</b> is positioned 90 degrees apart from the next buoyancy window <b>121</b>. Thus, buoyancy windows <b>121</b><i>a-d </i>are equidistantly spaced about the fore chamber section wall <b>122</b> at angles of 90, 180, 270 and 360 degrees when measured about the central axis <b>115</b>. Similarly, buoyancy windows <b>131</b><i>a-d </i>of the aft chamber section <b>130</b> are equidistantly spaced about the aft chamber section wall <b>132</b> at angles of 90, 180, 270 and 360 degrees when measured about the central axis <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">A critical feature of the present invention is the coincident overlying relationship between the buoyancy windows <b>121</b><i>a-d </i>of the fore chamber section <b>120</b> and the buoyancy windows <b>131</b><i>a-d </i>of the aft chamber section <b>130</b> to adjust the buoyancy or weight of the floating fishing lure <b>100</b>. The variably buoyancy of the present invention is achieved when a buoyancy window, such as <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the fore chamber section <b>120</b> overlies the buoyancy chamber <b>131</b><i>a </i>of the aft chamber section <b>130</b>. Buoyancy windows <b>121</b><i>a </i>and <b>131</b><i>a </i>completely overlie and are coincident with each other and as such both buoyancy windows are aligned to create aperture valves <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>having a maximum opening area. By setting the valve apertures <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>to have maximum area openings as depicted <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 9</figref><i>a</i>, the floating fish lure <b>100</b> of the present invention takes on water through the valve apertures <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>filling the interior chamber <b>117</b> with water and causing the fish lure <b>100</b> to sink beneath the surface of the water. Since buoyancy windows <b>121</b><i>a-d </i>and <b>131</b><i>a-d </i>are equidistantly spaced about the periphery of the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, the size of the valve aperture opening created by one buoyancy window of the fore chamber section <b>120</b> partially or completely overlying a buoyancy window of the aft chamber section <b>130</b> will cause the opening to be of equal size for the other three remaining valve apertures.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">Alternatively, to increase the buoyancy of the fishing lure <b>100</b> of the present invention, the size or area of the valve aperture openings <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>must be reduced as described above with respect to the first embodiment of the present invention as depicted in FIG. <b>4</b>. By reducing the size of the aperture valve openings, less water is accepted into the interior chamber <b>117</b>, therefore allowing more air to remain within the interior chamber <b>117</b>. For instance, in the situation where the buoyancy window <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the fore chamber section <b>120</b> only partially overlies the buoyancy window <b>131</b><i>a </i>of the aft chamber section <b>130</b>, a relatively small valve aperture opening <b>116</b><i>a </i>is created when compared to the aperture valve opening <b>116</b><i>a </i>as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 9</figref><i>a</i>. Although not shown in the drawings, to cause the fish lure of the present invention to act as a bobber and always float on top of the surface of the water, the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> are positioned relative to each other so that neither buoyancy windows <b>121</b><i>a-d </i>and <b>131</b><i>a-d </i>overlie one another, thereby failing to create an valve aperture opening. Without a valve aperture opening in the present invention, water is incapable of entering the interior chamber <b>117</b> and the air within the interior chamber <b>117</b> is incapable of escaping, thereby causing the fish lure <b>10</b> of the present invention to float on top of the surface of the water.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">As described above, the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> of the second embodiment of the present invention are held in proximal contact by the combined elements of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> and threaded end cap <b>150</b>. The second embodiment of the present invention has multiple advantages, in that the buoyancy of the fish lure <b>100</b> is easily adjusted by releasing the threaded end cap <b>150</b> and modifying the relative coincident overlie of the buoyancy windows <b>121</b>, <b>131</b> of the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>. Additionally, the threaded end cap <b>150</b> and threaded portion <b>141</b> of the hollow threaded rod <b>140</b> are capable of producing a strong contraction force to pull the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> together by tightening the threaded end cap <b>150</b> against the annular rim <b>124</b> of the fore chamber section <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">Positioned on the proximal end <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the fore chamber section <b>120</b> is a first annular serrated locking means <b>125</b> integrally formed as part of internal edge of the fore chamber section wall <b>122</b> and extending outwardly away from the fore chamber <b>120</b>. Similarly positioned on the exterior surface of the aft chamber section wall <b>132</b> between the proximal and distal ends <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>is a second annular serrated locking means <b>135</b> integrally formed as part of internal edge of the fore chamber section wall <b>132</b> and extending outwardly away from the aft chamber section <b>130</b>. Both first and second annular serrated locking means <b>125</b>, <b>135</b> are equal in diameter and have a plurality of teeth <b>125</b><i>a</i>, <b>135</b><i>a </i>which outwardly extend away from the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> at interlocking angles.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">Together with the threaded end cap <b>150</b> and hollow attaching rod <b>140</b>, the first and second annular serrated locking means <b>125</b>, <b>135</b> enable a user to adjust the buoyancy of the fish lure <b>100</b> with a relatively high degree of precision. By increasing the number of teeth <b>125</b><i>a</i>, <b>135</b><i>a </i>for the first and second annular serrated locking means <b>125</b>, <b>135</b>, the precision of buoyancy can also be increased. Likewise, reducing the number of teeth of the annular serrated locking means reduces the precision of buoyancy adjustment. Although not shown in the drawings, indicia positioned around the circumference of the either the fore or aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> can conceivably be incorporated to indicate degrees of buoyancy, thereby enabling the user to easily adjust the fishing lure <b>100</b> to a desired buoyancy.</p>
<p id="P-00055" num="00055">The initial set up of the fishing lure <b>100</b> of the second embodiment of the present invention begins with the insertion of the illumination means <b>143</b> into the interior bore <b>146</b> of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> the desired distance so that the light means <b>143</b> is held snugly in place by a friction fit. Prior to inserting the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> through the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> a buoyancy setting may be determined. By setting the coincident overlie of the buoyancy windows <b>121</b><i>a-d </i>and <b>131</b><i>a-d </i>to produce valve aperture openings <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>of the desired size, the preferred degree of buoyancy for the fishing lure <b>100</b> is attained. The fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> are temporarily held together by abutting the first and second annular serrated locking means <b>125</b>, <b>135</b> so that the buoyancy windows <b>121</b><i>a-d </i>and <b>131</b><i>a-d </i>can be set to overlie each respective other by the desired amount.</p>
<p id="P-00056" num="00056">Once the desired buoyancy setting is attained and the illumination means <b>143</b> is fully secured to the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b>, the first end <b>140</b><i>a </i>of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> is inserted entirely through the distal and proximal apertures <b>136</b><i>b </i>and <b>136</b><i>a </i>of the aft chamber section <b>130</b> and also inserted entirely through the distal and proximal apertures <b>126</b><i>b </i>and <b>126</b><i>a </i>of the fore chamber section <b>120</b>. After inserting the first end <b>140</b><i>a </i>of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> through both fore and aft chambers <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, threaded end cap <b>150</b> is placed over the first end <b>140</b><i>a </i>of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> so as to directly engage the threaded portion <b>141</b> of the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b>. Upon rotation of the threaded end cap <b>150</b> about the central axis <b>115</b>, the threaded end cap <b>150</b> is tightened against the annular rim <b>124</b> on the fore chamber section <b>120</b>. Further tightening of the threaded end cap <b>150</b> upon the threaded portion <b>141</b> causes the annular flange <b>144</b> to be drawn towards and abut against the distal end <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the aft chamber section <b>130</b>. Additional tightening of the threaded end cap <b>150</b> causes the annular flange <b>144</b> and the threaded end cap <b>150</b> to force together the first and second annular serrated locking means <b>125</b>, <b>135</b> and tightly seal distal aperture <b>136</b><i>b </i>of the aft chamber section <b>130</b> and the proximal aperture <b>126</b><i>a </i>of the fore chamber section <b>120</b> to securely hold the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> together.</p>
<p id="P-00057" num="00057">The tightening of the threaded end cap <b>150</b> draws both the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> together, thereby causing the plurality of teeth <b>125</b><i>a </i>of the first annular serrated locking means <b>125</b> to directly engage recesses between the plurality of teeth <b>135</b><i>a </i>of the second annular serrated locking means <b>135</b>. The combination of the threaded end cap <b>150</b> and the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b> securely hold the fore and aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> together not only by a contraction force caused by relative rotation about the central axis between the threaded end cap <b>150</b> and the hollow attaching rod <b>140</b>, but also by the interlocking relationship of the plurality of teeth <b>125</b><i>a </i>of the fore chamber section <b>120</b> directly engaging the recesses between the plurality of teeth <b>135</b><i>a </i>of the aft chamber section <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00058" num="00058">Perhaps the most critical feature of the second embodiment of the present invention is the method of adjusting the buoyancy of the fishing lure <b>100</b> of the present invention, either manually or remotely. Although the present invention is referred to as a fish lure, it is not limited to such, since the present invention is a multi-functioning device, in that it facilitates the placement of other fishing lures and baits through its variable buoyancy. The fish lure <b>100</b> is able to function as a sinker, bobber or a buoyant facilitator to enable fishing lures and baits to attain any level of buoyancy equilibrium between the fishing lure <b>100</b> and the water, thereby producing a natural appearance.</p>
<p id="P-00059" num="00059">As described above, the method of manually adjusting the degree of buoyancy is controlled by adjusting the coincident overlying relationship between the buoyancy windows <b>121</b><i>a-d </i>and <b>131</b><i>a-d </i>to produce a specific size of aperture valve openings <b>116</b><i>a-d</i>, such that the larger the size of the aperture valve openings <b>116</b><i>a-d</i>, the less buoyant the fishing lure <b>100</b> will be. Conversely, the smaller the size of the aperture valve openings <b>116</b><i>a-d</i>, the higher degree of buoyancy the fish lure <b>100</b> will attain. For instance, consider the case where the aperture valve openings <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>of the present invention are set to have a maximum opening. In such a situation, upon casting the fish lure <b>100</b> into a body of water, the interior chamber <b>117</b> will shortly fill with water, causing the fish lure <b>100</b> to sink towards the bottom of the body of water due to the maximum sized aperture valve openings <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>permitting the intake of a relatively large amount of water. Alternatively, consider the case where the aperture valve openings <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>of the present invention are closed thereby prohibiting any amount of water passing through the valve apertures <b>16</b><i>a-d </i>and into the interior chamber <b>117</b>. In such a situation, the fish lure would act as a bobber floating on the surface of the water. Located between the extremes of the valve aperture openings <b>116</b><i>a-d</i>, either being fully open or completely closed, are a large number of degrees of buoyancy settings only limited by the number of teeth <b>125</b><i>a</i>, <b>135</b><i>a </i>of the first and second annular serrated locking means <b>125</b>, <b>135</b>. Within such a large number of degrees of buoyancy, a fisherman can choose almost any desired level of buoyancy. In the situation where the fisherman is aware that the fish are feeding near the bottom of the body of water, the fisherman can set the aperture valve openings <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>somewhere between maximum size and half-size. Continuing along the same manners of adjustments, the fisherman can attain the precise degree of desired buoyancy.</p>
<p id="P-00060" num="00060">An additional advantageous feature of the present invention is the method of remotely adjusting the buoyancy of the fishing lure <b>100</b> while in the water. In the situation where the fisherman is aware of the presence of fish feeding in the area, but is unaware of the particular depth the fish are located, the fishing lure <b>100</b> is capable of gradually reducing the buoyancy of the lure by jerking or jigging the lure, thereby forcing water through the aperture valve openings <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>and into the interior chamber <b>117</b>, causing the fish lure <b>100</b> to sink to a lower depth. For instance, with the aperture valve openings <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>partially closed, the fish lure <b>100</b> is cast out into a body of water. Upon landing on the surface of the water, the fish lure <b>100</b> floats on top of the surface of water acting as a bobber. If the fisherman is unsuccessful in receiving any strikes from fish, the fisherman simply lightly jerks or jigs the fish lure <b>100</b>, thereby forcing a small amount of water through the valve aperture openings <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>and into the chamber <b>117</b>. The newly added amount of water entering through the valve apertures <b>116</b><i>a-d </i>and into the interior chamber <b>117</b>, increases the weight of the fish lure <b>100</b>, thereby reducing the buoyancy to a small degree and causing the fish lure <b>100</b> to sink to a slightly lower depth beneath the surface of the water. Additional slight jerks or jigs force more water into the interior chamber, causing the fish lure to sink to an even slightly deeper depth. This procedure is carried out until the fisherman determines the appropriate depth the fish are feeding at. Once the specific feeding depth is determined, the fisherman can retrieve the fish lure <b>100</b> and manually fill the interior chamber <b>117</b> with the appropriate amount of water to achieve the newly discovered degree of buoyancy for the fish lure. Once the interior chamber is manually filled, the fisherman simply closes the valve apertures <b>116</b><i>a-d</i>, thereby prohibiting the interexchange of water and air from escaping from the interior chamber <b>117</b> and again casts out into the body of water with the fishing lure <b>100</b> set to the desired degree of buoyancy.</p>
<p id="P-00061" num="00061">To aid the fisherman in determining the amount of water to add to the interior chamber <b>117</b> of the fishing lure <b>100</b>, a first set of indicia markings (not shown) representing degrees of buoyancy may be disposed on the aft chamber section <b>130</b> and serve as fill lines for the fisherman. To achieve a particular degree of buoyancy, the fisherman simply adds water to the interior chamber <b>117</b> of the aft chamber section <b>130</b> until the water level reaches the desired fill line thereby achieving the desired degree of buoyancy. Similarly, a second set of indicia markings (not shown) may be placed on either the fore or aft chamber sections <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> indicating degrees of buoyancy when adjusting the size of the valve apertures <b>116</b><i>a-d</i>. Both first and second sets of indicia markings can be used together to determine the appropriate buoyancy required to reach the desired feeding depth.</p>
<p id="P-00062" num="00062">As described above with respect to the first embodiment of the present invention, fishing lure <b>100</b> of the second embodiment of the present invention can also incorporate such additional features to possibly increase the desirability of the lure to fish as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, provided the incorporation of the above mentioned additional features do not adversely affect either the functionality of the fish lure <b>100</b> or the adjustability of the buoyancy.</p>
<p id="P-00063" num="00063">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, in the case where the fisherman wishes to take advantage of the situation where a fish may strike the fishing lure <b>100</b> of the present invention, a hook assembly <b>114</b> is attached on a surface of the aft chamber section <b>130</b>. Eyelet <b>114</b><i>a </i>can be affixed to aft chamber section <b>130</b> through conventional plastic welding or more preferably made integrally as a unit with the aft chamber section <b>130</b> to assure a secure attachment.

<p id="P-00005" num="00005">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">This invention relates to a bait bucket and, more particularly, to a pneumatic bait bucket including an air pump for selectively controlling the water level inside the bucket so that live bait can be easily removed.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">2. Prior Art</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">Bait buckets for carrying live bait are well known in the art. Pails have been used for years to hold a quantity of water containing minnows, leeches and the like, which must be kept in water in order to preserve their greatest usefulness as bait. When live bait is free in the water, however, it can be quite difficult to catch the bait because it can elude one's reach. In addition, it is generally necessary to put at least a hand, and probably a forearm, into the water in order to capture the live bait. This means that one may need to take time to roll up a sleeve so that it does not get wet. Furthermore, because one's hand and forearm generally do get wet when the bait is retrieved from the bucket, one may feel a need to dry off after retrieving bait from the bucket, especially in cold and windy weather.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">In order to provide a bait bucket which does not require the user to capture live bait while the bait is swimming in water, a number of bait buckets have been proposed. Such prior art bait buckets may include an outer housing and an inner housing having water passage means for allowing water to pass into and out of the interior of the inner housing. Thus, the inner housing can be removed from the outer housing leaving the water behind but retaining the live bait so that the bait may be easily selected without putting one's hand and forearm into the water.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Unfortunately, it generally takes two hands to manipulate bait buckets of this kind in order to retrieve one's bait. The inner housing must be lifted or otherwise manipulated with one hand, while the bait is retrieved with the other hand. If the angler has a fishing rod to hold with one hand, it generally needs to be put down in order to select the bait.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">Accordingly, a need exists for a bait bucket which can be easily manipulated with a single hand in order to select and remove live bait without putting one's forearm into the water in an attempt to capture the bait. The present invention provides a solution to this and other problems and offers other advantages over the prior art, and solves other problems associated therewith.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e610" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">In view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a pneumatic bait bucket including a water level adjusting means that is easily operable by a user. These and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention are provided by an apparatus for storing bait. The apparatus includes a first container defining an outer wall and a second container defining an inner wall and being removably positionable within the first container. The second container has a plurality of apertures formed in the inner wall thereof for allowing the first and second containers to be in fluid communication with each other.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">A lid is attached to the top portion of the apparatus and is selectively movable between open and closed positions. The apparatus is generally airtight after the lid is moved to a closed position. The lid preferably includes a latch for assisting to maintain the lid at a closed position. The apparatus further includes a mechanism for selectively exhausting and compressing air into the apparatus for causing water to pass through the first and second containers. Advantageously, when air is introduced into the first container water is introduced into the second container and when air is removed from the first container water is removed out of the second container to thereby make it easier for a user to remove live bait therefrom. In addition, the water inside of the second container becomes aerated when air is introduced into the first container and when the lid is at an open position.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">The apparatus further includes a control panel attached to the outer wall of the first container for selectively operating the mechanism for exhausting and compressing air. The control panel may include a power supply source such as a battery, for example. The apparatus may further include a power supply cord removably attachable to the power supply source for recharging same when the apparatus is not in an operating mode and for supplying power to the apparatus when same is in an operating mode.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">The mechanism for selectively exhausting and compressing air preferably includes an air pump disposed generally within the control panel and operatively connected to the first container. An elongate hose passes through the plurality of apertures and has opposed end portions disposed within the first and second containers respectively for selectively transferring water therebetween. A plurality of seals are preferably fitted within the plurality of apertures and around the hose for assisting to maintain the second container substantially air-tight from the first container.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">The apparatus may further include a seine having a substantially annular shape and a plurality of apertures formed adjacent to a perimeter thereof. The seine is preferably disposed adjacent to the bottom of the second container and for causing an air pocket to form at a center portion thereof. Advantageously, air bubbles can be evenly disbursed through the plurality of apertures when the apparatus is placed on an uneven surface.</p>

A</figref> notch <b>19</b> is formed along a perimeter of the housing <b>11</b> and at a top portion thereof for receiving a releasable latch <b>13</b> extending downwardly from a bottom surface of lid <b>12</b>. Such a latch <b>13</b> has a lip protruding outwardly therefrom and for engaging a sidewall of notch <b>19</b> when the lid <b>12</b> is moved to a close position, as perhaps best shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. In particular, when lid <b>12</b> is at a closed position, the lower portion of latch <b>13</b> becomes disposed below notch <b>19</b> with its lip engaged therewith. Thus, lid <b>12</b> may be maintained at a closed position while latch <b>13</b> is locked with notch <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">A handle <b>17</b> having opposed end portions secured to the exterior surface of housing <b>11</b>. Such a handle <b>17</b> is pivotable between down and up positions for assisting a user to carry the apparatus <b>10</b>. A control panel <b>15</b> is connected to an exterior surface of housing <b>11</b> and includes a plurality of control buttons <b>16</b> positioned at the exterior surface thereof for easy user access.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in more detail, control panel <b>15</b> houses a conventional air pump <b>20</b> and a conventional power supply source <b>21</b>. Such an air pump <b>20</b> is powered by power supply source <b>21</b>, which may include a set of conventional batteries readily available in the industry. Accordingly, when control buttons <b>16</b> are depressed, the air pump <b>20</b> becomes activated and either introduces/compresses air into a first container <b>24</b> or removes/exhausts air therefrom. In particular, an opening <b>29</b> is formed in the outer wall <b>22</b> of housing <b>11</b> for allowing the air pump <b>20</b> to transfer air therethrough.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">The outer wall <b>22</b> forms the general shape of the cylindrical housing <b>11</b> and an inner wall <b>23</b> forms the general shape of the second container <b>25</b> disposed within housing <b>11</b>. The first container <b>24</b> has a top portion <b>30</b>, which is defined by the perimeter of housing <b>12</b>. Notably, air can only be introduced into or removed from first container <b>24</b> via opening <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">The second container <b>25</b> has a top portion defining a lip and engaging a corresponding lip of the first container <b>24</b>. Its inner wall <b>23</b> converges downwardly towards a lower portion of housing <b>11</b>. The bottom surface of the second container <b>25</b> has a generally convex shape and is spaced from the bottom surface <b>26</b> of housing <b>11</b> thereby allowing water to travel therebetween. A plurality of apertures <b>27</b> are formed in the inner wall <b>23</b> of the second container <b>25</b> and at upper and lower portions thereof. Such apertures <b>27</b> allow an elongate flexible hose <b>14</b> to pass therethrough with the opposed end portions of the hose <b>14</b> being disposed within second container <b>25</b> and first container <b>24</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">Of course, such opposed end portions should be disposed below the respective water levels of the second container <b>25</b> and first container <b>24</b> so that the water levels can be adjusted as air in introduced and removed from the first container <b>24</b>. A plurality of seals <b>28</b> are fitted within apertures <b>27</b> and around the outer surface of hose <b>14</b> so that a substantially airtight connection is formed between hose <b>14</b> and aperture <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">A seine <b>35</b>, having a substantially annular shape and a plurality of apertures formed adjacent to a perimeter thereof, is removably positionable within the second container <b>25</b>. The seine is preferably disposed adjacent to a bottom of the second container for causing an air pocket to form at a center portion thereof so that air bubbles can be evenly disbursed through the plurality of apertures when the apparatus is being aerated while placed on an uneven surface.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> perhaps best illustrates the respective water levels within the first container <b>24</b> and the second container <b>25</b> after air pump <b>20</b> has removed a predetermined amount of air from first container <b>24</b>. Thus, the water level of the first container <b>24</b> has been raised and the water level of the second container <b>25</b> has been lowered. Such respective water levels are desired when a user or angler is ready to remove live bait positioned within second container <b>25</b>. By lowering the water level of the second container <b>25</b>, live bait such as minnows and leeches are positioned in a more concentrated area and therefore become more easily removable from the second container <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second container <b>25</b> is shown as having a higher water level with the first container <b>24</b> having a lower water level. In such a state, lid <b>12</b> has been moved to an open position thereby allowing air to freely flow into and out of the second container <b>25</b>. More importantly, with lid <b>12</b> was at a closed position, the air pump <b>20</b> located within the control panel <b>15</b> introduced air into the first container <b>24</b> to thereby cause water to be transferred, via hose <b>14</b>, into second container <b>25</b>. With lid <b>12</b> moved to an open position, the live bait in the second container <b>25</b> may be aerated by introducing air into the first container <b>24</b>. To aerate the water, the air pump <b>20</b> may be selectively operatively via a timer device <b>34</b> connected to the control panel <b>15</b>. Therefore, a user may activate the air pump <b>20</b> over a predetermined time-span so that the water inside the second container <b>25</b> can be aerated.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an alternate embodiment <b>10</b>&#x2032; is shown as including a power cord <b>31</b> having opposed end portions connectable to a power outlet and control panel <b>15</b>, respectively. A transformer <b>32</b> is also connected to power cord <b>31</b>. In addition, the power supply source <b>20</b> may be recharged with power cord <b>31</b> when the apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; is not being operated. Otherwise, the apparatus <b>10</b>&#x2032; may be operated by a power cord <b>31</b> and not the power supply source <b>21</b> located within control panel <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an exploded view of bait bucket <b>10</b> is shown wherein lid <b>12</b> is connectable to outer container <b>24</b>. Inner container <b>25</b> is removably positionable within the outer container <b>24</b> and rests on a perimeter thereof. Inner container <b>25</b> has an inner wall <b>23</b> that converges downwardly to form a generally conical shape. Hose <b>14</b> is shown as being bendable in different directions with one end being positionable into a lower portion of the inner container <b>25</b>. Such a lower portion preferably has a concave shape for assisting the water to be drained out of the bottom thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">A saucer-shaped member <b>35</b> or seine is disposed above such an end portion of the hose <b>14</b> for preventing live bait from being sucked into hose <b>14</b>. Air pump <b>20</b> is connectable to the outer container <b>24</b> via hose <b>38</b> and is preferably powered by batteries <b>36</b>. Such an air pump <b>20</b> and batteries <b>36</b> are preferably housed within the control panel <b>15</b> and selectively operable thereby.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">As perhaps best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, seine <b>35</b> has a generally annular shape and includes a plurality of apertures <b>40</b> for allowing air bubbles to pass therethrough a aerate the water inside the inner container <b>25</b>. The seine <b>35</b> will build an air pocket in the center thereof and will help the even disbursement of the air bubbles when the bait bucket is sitting on uneven ground. The seine <b>35</b> is used to allow the even flow of air bubbles to aerate the water towards the outer perimeter of the inner container <b>25</b>. This can also assist to prevent the water in the bait bucket <b>10</b> from freezing during inclement weather conditions, such as when ice fishing.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">Furthermore, the seine <b>35</b> helps to prevent the live bait from being sucked into the hose <b>14</b> and deposited into the holding container. Thus, the plurality of apertures <b>40</b> are preferably smaller than the live bait but sufficiently large for allowing water to flow therethrough and towards hose <b>14</b>. The seine <b>35</b> therefore acts as an aeration device and also assists to effectively maintaining the live bait within the inner container <b>25</b> while draining the water therefrom.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">While the invention has been described with respect to certain specific embodiments, it will be appreciated that many modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is intended, therefore, by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">An electronic animal trap with a CPU-controlled, rearming, high voltage output circuit for trapping and exterminating pests. The high-voltage output circuit is connected to a pair of killing plates which are activated with a high-voltage pulse train for a period of time constituting a killing cycle when a known impedance is sensed across the plates. If, upon conclusion of the killing cycle, the impedance remains across the plates, the circuit activates a visual indicator to alert a user that the trap contains a dead mouse. However, if the impedance increases to that of an open circuit, likely meaning the animal has escaped, the circuit automatically rearms itself and no visual indicator is initiated.</p>

<p id="P-00002" num="00002">This application is entitled to and hereby claims the priority of co-pending U.S. Provisional application, Ser. No. 60/467,595 filed May 5, 2003.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="heading-d0e1882" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">The invention relates to electric or electronic animal traps, and relates more particularly to an animal trap adapted to catch and electrocute a targeted animal, and also to rearm in the event the continuing presence of the animal is not detected upon completion of a killing cycle.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">2. The Prior Art</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Incline plane animal traps have been available for over one hundred years. The commercial embodiments of such traps currently available commonly comprise a housing defining an enlarged enclosure with one, or perhaps two, inclined plane trap assemblies communicating the interior of the enclosure with the exterior of the housing via an elongated passageway. An inclined plane tilting floor member is positioned in the passageway of each trap assembly and is adapted to lift a door to block the entrance opening when the animal passes beyond a pivot point, thereby limiting escape from the enclosure. When the animal exits the passageway into the enclosure, the door falls by gravity on the entrance end of the tilting floor to reset the trap and the raised end of the tilting floor limits the ability of the captured animal to return to the passageway. Such a trap is representatively described in co-pending application Ser. No. 09/729,832, filed Dec. 6, 2000 (the '832 application) now U.S. Pat. No. 6,622,422, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Captured animals will attempt to escape in any way possible. When rodents are caught in the enclosure, they often try to grasp the inner end of the tilting floor to regain access to the passageway. In some instances, rodents on the tilting floor have been able to grasp the side of top edges of the door with their claws or teeth to pull the door down against their own weight, and thereby escape from the trap.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">In order to prevent escape when live capture of the animal is not desired or needed, as in the case of vermin, animal traps have been developed which include electric or electronic components to kill the trapped animal. Many of these traps, however, have very complicated structures which are costly to manufacture. Additionally, these traps are not conveniently employed without disruption of the animal's environment nor are they able to control the voltage to the trap. Some are designed to provide continuous power which is not cost effective, and others cannot keep the animal in the trap, because the animal can grasp the top of a side edge of the trap door and scratch or chew its way out.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">In U.S. Pat. No. 5,269,091 to Johnson et al, a flexible plate is charged with a base plate. Upon entry into the trap, the pest presses the flexible plate into contact with the base plate, completing the circuit and applying a high voltage to the pest. The problem with this type of device is that voltage is applied only when the pest makes contact with the flexible plate. In many cases, when the pest is initially shocked it will move and not receive enough of a shock to exterminate it. As there is no trap door, the pest can readily escape, thus defeating the purpose of the trap.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">In an attempt to solve the previously noted electrical problem, U.S. Pat. No. 5,949,636 to Johnson et al discloses a portable pest electrocution device with a resistive switch trigger. The device has a resistive switch to sense the presence of a pest between two electrodes. One of the electrodes is set at a high voltage and the other is set to ground. The ground electrode is a separate stake-shaped electrode which is placed physically in the ground. When the pest enters the trap, contact is made, and a timer begins for a set period of time. After timing out, the timer deactivates the power to the electrodes. A problem with this device is that a separate ground stake is necessary which, if forgotten or misplaced, renders the device inoperative.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">The trap of copending application, Ser. No. 10/043,161, filed Jan. 14, 2002 (the '161 applications) now U.S. Pat. No. 6,609,328, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, has been designed to overcome the defects in the prior art and provides a virtually escape-proof animal trap with many advantages. Not only is the animal electrocuted effectively, but the device set forth in the '161 application also provides a visual indicator signaling when the trap has initiated a kill cycle and thereafter requires servicing to remove an electrocuted animal.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">Other trap designs that have effectively overcome the pest-escape defects in the prior art are set forth in copending application, Ser. No. 10/320,688, filed Dec. 17, 2002 (the '688 application) now U.S. Pat. No. 6,622,422, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Eliminating the need for a tilting platform, the diverter traps disclosed in the '688 application advantageously substitute at least two fixed barriers or diverter members that are positioned between the opening of the trap and a pair of spaced charge plates electrically connected to a voltage source. The two charge plates are configured such that contact with both charge plates simultaneously by a target animal will actuate the electric charge to effectively kill the animal.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">However, a problem still exists in that, while the trap may have been triggered by an animal so as to initiate the kill cycle and subsequent entry into a standby mode requiring service to reset the trap, the animal subjected to the voltage may not have been killed and may have escaped. As a result, wasted effort is expended by exterminator personnel or other users in servicing and resetting a trap which, in fact, is already empty.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">Therefore, a need exists for a trap that combines an electronic circuit for effective pest electrocution with a detection mechanism to rearm the trap without human intervention in the event of pest escape.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1947" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">In view of the foregoing, one object of the present invention is to overcome the difficulties due to false-positive indications from an electronically controlled animal trap.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Another object of the present invention is to provide an electronically controlled animal trap that is able to detect the absence of an animal and thereafter to rearm itself multiple times without requiring human intervention.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">A further object of the present invention is to provide an electronically controlled animal trap with reduced servicing requirements through automatic rearming in the event of animal escape.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">In accordance with this and other objects, the present invention is directed to a rearming, high-voltage, electronic animal trap for killing and retaining target animals, typically rodents such as mice. The trap includes a micro-controller chip with a high voltage circuit for generating and delivering a high-voltage pulse train to a pair of killing plates. With the circuit in an armed state, a killing cycle is triggered when a known impedance is sensed across the killing plates. If, upon conclusion of the killing cycle, the impedance remains across the plates, the circuit activates a visual indicator to alert a user that the trap contains a dead mouse. If, on the other hand, the impedance increases to that of an open circuit, likely meaning the animal has escaped, the circuit automatically rearms itself and no visual indicator is initiated.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p>

<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Although only a few preferred embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that other embodiments are possible and likely. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention is to be limited in its scope to the details of construction and arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, in describing the preferred embodiments, specific terminology will be resorted to for the sake of clarity. It is to be understood that each specific term includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">Although the concepts of the instant invention are equally applicable to traps for animals of any size, devices of this type are primarily utilized in connection with the trapping of rodents such as mice and rats and, therefore, further discussion herein will be primarily directed to this application. The present invention is also of particular utility in the extermination of large insects.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of the rearming circuit components, generally designated by the reference numeral <b>200</b>, according to the present invention. The circuit components <b>200</b> includes a high-voltage output circuit <b>186</b> controlled by a central processing unit (CPU) <b>187</b> and electrically connected to a power supply <b>184</b>. The CPU <b>187</b> may be embodied as a standard 8-bit micro controller chip, and the high output circuit <b>186</b> can be a standard fly-back circuit.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">A first electrical connection member <b>188</b>, which may be embodied as a wire, receives current from the high-voltage output circuit <b>186</b> and also connects to a first plate <b>102</b> so that electricity can be provided thereto. A second electrical connection member <b>190</b>, which may also be a wire, connects the high-voltage output circuit <b>186</b> to a second plate <b>104</b>. The circuit is activated by a switch <b>152</b> accessible from the exterior of the trap and adjacent an LED <b>154</b> which provides the user with visual indicators of trap operating status.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">Before describing the structure and operation of the rearming circuit components <b>200</b> of the present invention in detail, representative trap embodiments within which the circuitry may be incorporated will be briefly explained in order to provide the necessary backdrop for a full understanding of the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> depict perspective and exploded views, respectively, of an electronic animal trap, generally designated by the reference numeral <b>120</b>, which is suitable for use with the high-voltage, rearming circuitry of the present invention. Such a trap is fully described in the copending '161 application, previously incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">As shown, the housing <b>122</b> has a bottom wall <b>124</b>, upstanding peripheral walls <b>126</b>, and a roof <b>127</b> with a cover <b>128</b> carrying the switch <b>152</b> or button that toggles from an &#x201c;on&#x201d; or standby position to an &#x201c;off&#x201d; or reset position. The trap <b>120</b> is activated by way of the switch <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">The LED <b>154</b> is mounted on the cover <b>128</b> to provide visual indications of the activity and status of the trap. The LED <b>154</b> turns &#x201c;on&#x201d; or flashes to provide a visual indication to the user during activation of the trap and thereafter when the trap contains a dead mouse as will be more fully described hereinafter. A second LED <b>153</b>, as well as others, may also be included should separate indicators of differing colors be desired.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The cover <b>128</b> extends over an electronics area, generally designated by the reference numeral <b>180</b>, with a battery lid <b>129</b> covering an area <b>182</b> which contains the power supply <b>184</b>. Of course, the assembly may be simplified by using a single roof such as is disclosed in the '688 application, previously incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">The high-voltage output circuitry of the present invention may be incorporated within any of the embodiments shown in the '688 application, as well as in the '161 application, and the present application is intended to cover all such embodiments. However, the representative trap embodiment of the '161 application as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> is more explicitly set forth herein for the purposes of increased clarity in describing the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the bottom wall or base <b>124</b>, peripheral walls <b>126</b> including back wall <b>134</b> and front wall <b>137</b>, and roof <b>127</b> together define an enclosure for holding the targeted animal. The peripheral walls <b>126</b> include a first side <b>126</b><i>a </i>and a parallel second side <b>126</b><i>b </i>defining the elongated passageway <b>130</b>. An entrance opening <b>132</b> at one end of the passageway <b>130</b> communicates with the exterior of the housing through an aperture in the front wall <b>137</b>. Portions of the housing are movable between a closed position in which the captured animal is retained within the enclosure, and an opened position in which access is provided to the enclosure to remove the electrocuted animal therefrom. For example, the roof <b>127</b> may pivotally rotate about hinges <b>135</b>, <b>136</b> to open the trap for disposal of the carcass.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">The trap assembly further includes a floor member <b>140</b> extending along the passageway <b>130</b> intermediate the sides <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b</i>. The floor member <b>140</b> has a first end portion <b>142</b> juxtaposed to the front wall <b>137</b> with entrance opening <b>132</b>, and an opposite second end portion <b>144</b> juxtaposed to the back wall <b>134</b>. A pivot element <b>145</b> underlies and supports the floor member <b>140</b> intermediate its end portions for tilting movement of the floor member <b>140</b> between a first position in which the first end portion <b>142</b> is lowered and the second end portion <b>144</b> is raised, and a second position in which the first end portion <b>142</b> is raised and the second end portion <b>144</b> is lowered. A floor galvanized pin or carbon steel wire <b>147</b> extends through pivot <b>145</b> for permitting the floor member <b>140</b> to rotate or, more specifically, to perform a teeter-totter motion.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">A door member <b>160</b> has a bottom edge portion <b>165</b> and a top edge <b>164</b> with a hinge element <b>162</b> secured to the bottom edge portion <b>165</b> adjacent to the entrance opening <b>132</b> for pivotal movement of the door member <b>160</b> between a lowered position in which the door member <b>160</b> rests on the first end portion <b>142</b> when the floor member <b>140</b> is in its first position to provide access to the passageway <b>130</b> by a targeted animal through the entrance opening <b>132</b>, and a raised position where the door member <b>160</b> blocks the entrance opening. A door galvanized pin or carbon steel wire <b>167</b> extends through hinge element <b>162</b> for permitting door member <b>160</b> to rotate.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">The door member <b>160</b> is biased toward its lowered position because the top edge <b>164</b> engages the roof <b>127</b> before it reaches its vertical position. The weight <b>146</b> mounted on the floor member <b>140</b> on the first end portion <b>142</b> thereof when the door member is in its lowered position maintains the floor member <b>140</b> in its first position, and the weight of an animal on the floor member <b>140</b> tilts the floor member <b>140</b> to its second position when the animal <b>150</b> passes from the entrance opening <b>132</b> beyond the pivot element <b>145</b> to thereby lift the door member <b>160</b> to its raised position.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">The power supply <b>184</b> which provides power to the trap can include one or more batteries, such as two AA batteries. Alternatively, the trap may be electrically connected to a wall outlet. When embodied as a battery, the power supply <b>184</b> may be conveniently located in the power supply area <b>182</b>. The battery cover <b>129</b> is preferably snap fitted for easy entry to the area <b>182</b> to replace expired batteries.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">A bottom plate <b>170</b> is positioned near the back wall <b>134</b> and extends parallel to the bottom wall <b>124</b>. An insulator <b>110</b> on the bottom plate <b>170</b> underlies the second end portion <b>144</b> of the floor member <b>140</b> when the floor member <b>140</b> is moved from its first position to its second position so that the target animal is only shocked when its rear paws are on the floor member <b>140</b> and its front paws are on the bottom plate <b>170</b>, as will be more specifically described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">The high-voltage output circuit <b>186</b> is electrically connected to the power supply <b>184</b> to convert the power to electricity. The first electrical connection member <b>188</b> receives the electricity from the high-voltage output circuit <b>186</b> and also connects to the floor member <b>140</b> so that electricity can be provided thereto. The second electrical connection member <b>190</b> connects to the bottom plate <b>170</b> near the back wall <b>134</b> to provide electricity to the bottom plate <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">The weight of the animal <b>150</b> on the floor member <b>140</b> tilts the floor member to its second position. When the animal <b>150</b> passes from the entrance opening <b>132</b>, beyond the pivot element <b>145</b>, its weight lifts the door member <b>160</b> to the raised position and blocks the animal <b>150</b> from leaving the trap.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">At this point, the bottom plate <b>170</b> and the floor member <b>140</b> are immediately adjacent one another, but kept in spaced relationship by the insulator <b>110</b>. The advancing mouse, however, by placing its front paws on the bottom plate <b>170</b> while its rear paws are still on the floor member <b>140</b>, completes the electrical circuit, allowing an electric current to flow between the bottom plate <b>170</b> and the floor member <b>140</b> to electrocute the mouse.</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cover may include a downwardly depending plate <b>80</b> interposed between the second end portion <b>144</b> of the floor member <b>140</b> and the bottom plate <b>170</b>, forcing the target animal to squeeze under the lower edge <b>81</b> in its attempt to get to the bait. In doing so, it must then step on the bottom plate <b>170</b> and, for all intents and purposes, is precluded by its own body from pulling back before the circuitry is closed, resulting in electrocution.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">A further representative embodiment of an electronic trap suitable for use with the circuitry of the present invention is the diverter trap illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> and fully disclosed in the '688 application. As shown, in place of the tilting platform of the '161 application, this embodiment of the '688 application substitutes at least two fixed barriers or diverter members <b>70</b>, <b>75</b> positioned between the opening <b>60</b> and the &#x201c;killing chamber&#x201d; <b>55</b>. Two spaced charge plates or electrodes <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are located in the killing chamber <b>55</b> and electrically connected to the electronic circuitry in the electronics area <b>180</b>&#x2032;. As with the floor and bottom members of the tilting platform of the '161 application previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the two charge plates <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are configured such that contact with both charge plates simultaneously by a target animal will actuate the electric charge to effectively kill the animal.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">The operation of the high-voltage, rearming circuitry of the present invention in conjunction with traps of the foregoing types will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which illustrates a flow chart of the electrical circuit according to the present invention; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> which illustrates the same circuit in schematic form.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">To commence operation of the trap, power is applied to the high-voltage output circuit <b>186</b>, either from a battery <b>184</b> or an electrical outlet, and the lid is closed. The unit is turned on, step <b>300</b>, by a user using the switch <b>152</b>, thereby placing the trap into an enabled condition. Upon entry into the enabled condition, the LED <b>154</b> flashes green once, step <b>302</b>, and then turns off. The high-voltage output circuit <b>186</b> detects the battery status and, if the battery power is low, step <b>304</b>, the LED flashes red one or more times, step <b>306</b>, as a visual indicator to the user that the batteries should be replaced. Upon conclusion of the red LED flashing procedure, and also if the battery power is found to be sufficient in step <b>304</b>, the unit remains in the enabled condition in a standby mode, step <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">As an alternative indicator in the event of low battery power, the LED may flash red on a continuing and regular basis. If the trap includes only one LED, then green flashing thereof concurrent with the red flashing will change the output color of the LED to indicate to the user that both conditions are being reported. The red and green colors are provided by diodes <b>15</b> of appropriate colors within the circuit <b>186</b> as shown in FIG. <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">The circuit <b>200</b> is automatically triggered or activated, step <b>310</b>, when a known impedance is sensed across the killing plates <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. According to a preferred embodiment, the impedance resulting in activation of the circuit is 10 k ohm to 1 M ohm as a resistance level representative of a mouse or large insect. Depending upon the resistors used to construct the circuit <b>186</b>, other resistance levels could, of course, be implemented to suit the intended target animal or insect. With a trigger resistance of less than 10 k ohm, the circuit may still be activated but the output voltage is reduced.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">Once activated, the circuit <b>186</b> delivers a high voltage pulse train to the killing plates <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. These high voltage pulses are preferably delivered as spikes of approximately 4000V occurring every 4.25 ms over a 20-second killing cycle, step <b>312</b>. The peak to peak current passing through a 1 M ohm trigger resistor when the circuit is activated is about 4 mA, and the load current is about 160 mA.</p>
<p id="P-00055" num="00055">Upon completion of the killing cycle, current to the plates is terminated, and the battery level is checked, step <b>314</b>. As before, if the battery power is low, step <b>314</b>, the LED flashes red one or more times, step <b>316</b>, as a visual indicator to the user that the batteries should be replaced. Upon conclusion of the red LED flashing procedure, and also if the battery power is found to be sufficient in step <b>314</b>, the unit checks a stored trigger count, step <b>318</b>, to determine if the circuit has been activated three times since entering the standby mode at step <b>308</b>. In the standby mode, the static voltage (open circuit) level across the plates is approximately 6 V DC.</p>
<p id="P-00056" num="00056">If the trigger count is equal to three, flashing of the green LED at a regular interval is initiated, step <b>320</b>, and the unit does not reenter the enabled condition. Particularly, the LED flashes green once, checks to see whether 24 hours have elapsed, step <b>322</b> and, if 24 hours have not elapsed, repeats the flash and check cycle, steps <b>320</b> and <b>322</b>. According to a preferred embodiment, the LED flashes green once every 5 seconds. When 24 hours have elapsed following the initiation of step <b>320</b>, the unit is turned off, step <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00057" num="00057">If the trigger count is less than three, the unit checks for the continued existence of the target impedance across the plates, step <b>326</b>, which indicates the continued presence of the mouse. If such resistance is still detected after about 15 seconds, the unit initiates the regular flashing and checking cycle, steps <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, to visually notify the user that the trap contains an electrocuted animal. The green flashing of the LED continues until the user services the trap or for a 24 period, step <b>322</b>, whichever occurs first, after which the unit is turned off.</p>
<p id="P-00058" num="00058">If there is no trigger resistance, step <b>326</b>, i.e., an open circuit (static voltage) is sensed between the killing plates upon completion of the killing cycle, the unit rearms to the enabled condition in standby mode, step <b>308</b>, and thereafter awaits another mouse trigger. In this case, the LED does not illuminate, precluding the user from responding to a false-positive condition.</p>
<p id="P-00059" num="00059">According to the preferred embodiment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in the event that the presence of the mouse is not detected following the killing cycle, the circuit will rearm itself twice in the manner just described, preferably within five seconds of completing the killing cycle. Once the unit has been triggered three times, step <b>318</b>, the flashing and rechecking cycle is entered, steps <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, regardless of load impedance on the killing plates, followed by unit shut-down after 24 hours. As would be apparent to persons of skill in the art, the circuit may be designed to rearm a greater or fewer number of times before turning off, depending upon system and user requirements.</p>
<p id="P-00060" num="00060">The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described and, accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e2779" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">This invention relates to improved methods and apparatus concerning preventing pests from entering a building.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e2789" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Typically in the prior art a garage door or warehouse door protecting a building has a flat bottom surface. When the door is lowered the flat bottom surface comes in contact with a ground surface. If the ground surface is even, then the door prevents pests, such as rodents from coming into the building. However, particularly in a warehouse setting, the ground surface frequently becomes uneven due to, for example, the operation of heavy equipment such as forklifts. When the ground surface is uneven, the flat bottom surface of the garage or warehouse door does not contact all of the ground surface. This creates gaps through which a rodent can gain entry into the building. This is a particular problem in warehouses where food is stored and where it is particularly important to keep pests out.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e2799" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">The present invention provides a technique for keeping rodents and other pests out of warehouses and other buildings. In one embodiment a pest control device or guard is provided which is attached or fixed near the bottom surface of an overhead door. The pest control device can adjust to uneven ground surfaces so that a fence or guard is provided to prevent pests, such as rats from entering buildings.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">In one embodiment the pest control device may be comprised of first, second, and third brackets. The brackets may be L-shaped. A plurality of pins is connected to the first, second, and third brackets so that each of the plurality of pins can move with respect to the first, second, and third brackets. The first bracket may prevent each of the plurality of pins from moving in a first direction beyond a first location and the second bracket may prevent each of the plurality of pins from moving in a second direction, which is opposite the first direction beyond a second location.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Each of the plurality of pins may be inserted through corresponding holes in the second and third brackets. The first bracket may be mounted near the bottom surface of a garage door. One or more of the brackets may be eliminated, so that for example one bracket may be provided or two brackets instead of three. Also one or more brackets may be replaced by plates or bars only, instead of L-shaped brackets.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The one or more brackets may be fixed to the door so that each of the plurality of pins is substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface of the door. The one or more brackets are typically fixed to each other by attachment devices, which may comprised bolts, nuts, and spacers.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">A method is also disclosed comprising the step of attaching a pest control device to a door. The pest control device may be of a form as previously described.</p>

Plate <b>74</b> and plate <b>76</b> of brackets <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively, are perforated and are each comprised of a plurality of holes. For each of pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> there is a corresponding hole in plate <b>74</b> through which each pin passes and through which each pin can slide up in the direction U until each pin reaches a position shown in FIG. <b>1</b>A and down in the direction D until each pin reaches a position shown in FIG. <b>2</b>A. One of these holes is hole <b>33</b><i>a </i>in plate <b>74</b>, whose location is shown by dashed lines in FIG. <b>8</b>A through which pin <b>30</b><i>a </i>can slide up and down. Similarly for each of pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> there is a corresponding hole in plate <b>76</b> through which each pin passes and through which each pin can slide up in the direction U until each pin reaches a position shown in FIG. <b>1</b>A and down in the direction D until each pin reaches a position shown in FIG. <b>2</b>A. One of these holes is hole <b>35</b><i>a </i>in plate <b>76</b>, whose location is shown by dashed lines in FIG. <b>8</b>A through which pin <b>30</b><i>a </i>can slide up and down.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">The attachment device <b>20</b> is comprised of bolt <b>20</b><i>a</i>, spacer <b>20</b><i>b</i>, spacer <b>20</b><i>c</i>, hex nut <b>20</b><i>e</i>, and washer <b>20</b><i>f</i>.

The attachment devices <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> fix the brackets <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>16</b> to each other.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">The pins <b>30</b> include all the pins located in the row at the rear of the pest control device <b>10</b> as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 6A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>2</b>A, and <b>3</b>A, pins <b>30</b> would be located furthest away from the door <b>101</b>. The pins <b>40</b> include all the pins in a middle row of the pest control device <b>10</b> as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>A. The pins <b>50</b> include all the pins located in a row near the front of the pest control device <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 6A</figref>. Each of the pins is shown is inserted through holes in brackets <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. For example, pin <b>30</b><i>a </i>is inserted through hole <b>31</b><i>a </i>in bracket <b>14</b> and hole <b>35</b><i>a </i>in bracket <b>16</b>. The locations of holes <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>a </i>are shown by dashed lines in FIG. <b>8</b>A. Each of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> have a head, which prevents them from falling through the brackets <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. For example pin <b>30</b><i>a </i>has a head <b>31</b><i>a </i>and pin <b>50</b><i>a </i>has a head <b>51</b><i>a </i>shown in FIG. <b>8</b>A.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> can be placed in a first state, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, so that all of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> have their heads contacting the surface <b>72</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>72</b> of the bracket <b>12</b>. The pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> cannot be moved any further upward in the direction U from this first state of FIG. <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">The pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> can be placed in a second state, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, so that all of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> have their heads contacting the surface <b>74</b><i>a </i>of the plate <b>74</b> of the bracket <b>14</b>. The pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> cannot be moved any further downwards in the direction D from this second state of FIG. <b>2</b>A.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">The pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> can be placed in a variety of other states in between the first state and second state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 2A</figref>. Each pin may be placed in a different state. For example, pin <b>30</b><i>a </i>may be moved upwards until in a position as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, while pin <b>30</b><i>b </i>may be moved downwards until in a position as in FIG. <b>2</b>A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a third state of the pest control device <b>10</b> where the pins have been placed in different positions. In the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, an uneven ground surface <b>300</b> has caused the pins to be located in various positions.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">In operation the pest control device <b>10</b> is bolted, screwed or fixed in some other manner to the door <b>101</b> as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>2</b>A, and <b>3</b>A, through holes in brackets, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>16</b> such as holes <b>13</b><i>b </i>and <b>13</b><i>a </i>shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. Screws <b>23</b><i>b </i>and <b>23</b><i>a </i>may be inserted through holes <b>13</b><i>b </i>and <b>13</b><i>a</i>, respectively, and screwed into door <b>101</b>. The screws <b>23</b><i>b </i>and <b>23</b><i>a </i>may be termed an attachment device for attaching the pest control device <b>10</b> to the door <b>101</b>. Each of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> can move from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to the position shown in FIG. <b>2</b>A and anywhere in between. The door <b>101</b> is typically connected to a door lowering apparatus, not shown, known in the art for raising and lowering a warehouse roller door, or a garage door. The door <b>101</b> is lowered so that the pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> come in contact with a ground or horizontal surface, such as surface <b>300</b>. The surface <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is uneven and has raised portions such as raised portion <b>300</b><i>a </i>and depressed portions such as depressed portion <b>300</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">Just before the pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> come in contact with the surface <b>300</b> the pins are in the state shown in FIG. <b>2</b>A. I.e. all of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> have their heads contacting surface <b>74</b><i>a </i>of plate <b>74</b> of bracket <b>14</b>. The pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> have fallen downwards in the direction D as far downwards as they can go. As the door <b>101</b> is lowered some of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> begin to come in contact with portions of the surface <b>300</b>. For example, pins <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c </i>come into contact with raised portion <b>300</b><i>a </i>of the surface <b>300</b>. This causes pins <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c </i>to be pushed upwards in the direction U. The pins <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c </i>are pushed upwards in the direction U either until they hit the plate <b>72</b> of the bracket <b>12</b> or until the door <b>101</b> has been lowered an acceptable distance.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">Eventually the door <b>101</b> is lowered until other pins, such as pins <b>40</b><i>b </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>come in contact with the depressed portion <b>300</b><i>b </i>of the surface <b>300</b>. The pins <b>40</b><i>b </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>will be pushed upwards in the direction U, but not as far upwards as the pins <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c</i>, because of the uneven surface <b>300</b>. The door <b>101</b> should be lowered until all the pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> contact a portion of the surface <b>300</b>. As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, because all of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> contact a portion of the surface <b>300</b>, a fence is created which prevents pests, such as rodents, from getting into a building. The spacing W<b>1</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, between the adjacent pins in any of the rows of pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> should be as small as possible and may be one quarter of an inch. The spacing between one pin of pins <b>30</b> and the closest pin of pins <b>40</b>, such as between pins <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, should be much less due to the interleaving of rows of pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b>. The spacing between pins <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b> may be one eighth of any inch. The pins can be made of metal such as steel, iron, or aluminum or any other suitable material. The pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> typically will be perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the door <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">A single bar or plate can be used instead of L shaped brackets <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. For example, plates <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> can be eliminated and perforated plates <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> can be used by themselves. The heads of each pin, such as the head <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the pin <b>30</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, are larger than the diameter of its corresponding holes such as holes <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>a</i>. The diameter of the body portion of each pin, such as body portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of pin <b>30</b><i>a </i>is less than its corresponding holes such as holes <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>a</i>, which allows the pin <b>30</b><i>a </i>to slide within the holes <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>a</i>. The diameter of the body portion of each pin, such as body portion <b>37</b><i>a </i>of pin <b>30</b><i>a</i>, may be one-eighth of an inch and the diameter of the holes, such as holes <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>a </i>may be slightly greater than one-eighth of an inch.</p>

The attachment devices <b>420</b> and <b>422</b> fix the member <b>416</b> to the top plate <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">The pins <b>430</b> include all the pins located in the row at the rear of the pest control device <b>410</b> as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 6B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b>B, pins <b>430</b> would be located furthest away from the door <b>101</b>. The pins <b>440</b> include all the pins in a middle row of the pest control device <b>410</b> as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>B. The pins <b>450</b> include all the pins located in a row near the front of the pest control device <b>410</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48 and 6B</figref>. Each of the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> is inserted through holes in member <b>416</b>. For example, pin <b>430</b><i>a </i>is inserted through hole <b>431</b><i>a </i>in member <b>416</b>. The location of hole <b>431</b><i>a </i>is shown by dashed lines in FIG. <b>8</b>B. Each of the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> have a head, which prevents them from falling through the member <b>416</b>. For example pin <b>30</b><i>a </i>has a head <b>31</b><i>a </i>and pin <b>450</b><i>a </i>has a head <b>451</b><i>a </i>shown in FIG. <b>8</b>B.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">The pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> can be placed in a first state, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, so that all of the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> have their heads contacting the surface <b>412</b><i>b </i>of the top plate <b>412</b>. The pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> cannot be moved any further upward in the direction U from this first state of FIG. <b>1</b>B.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">The pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> can be placed in a second state, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, so that all of the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> have their heads contacting the top surface <b>416</b><i>a </i>of the member <b>416</b>. The pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> cannot be moved any further downwards in the direction D from this second state of FIG. <b>2</b>B.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">The pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> can be placed in a variety of other states in between the first state and second state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2B</figref>. Each pin may be placed in a different state. For example, pin <b>430</b><i>a </i>may be moved upwards until in a position as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, while pin <b>430</b><i>b </i>may be moved downwards until in a position as in FIG. <b>2</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows a third state of the pest control device <b>410</b> where the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b>, have been placed in different positions. In the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, an uneven ground surface <b>500</b> has caused the pins to be located in various positions. The ground surface <b>500</b> is comprised of higher elevation <b>500</b><i>a </i>and lower elevation <b>500</b><i>b</i>. Pin <b>430</b><i>c </i>is pushed in further than pin <b>430</b><i>b </i>as a result of the uneven ground surface.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">In operation, the pest control device <b>410</b> is bolted, screwed or fixed in some other manner to the door <b>101</b> as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b>B, through holes in the plate <b>417</b> which is attached to member <b>416</b>, such as holes <b>417</b><i>a-d </i>shown in FIG. <b>2</b>B. Screws <b>427</b><i>a </i>and <b>427</b><i>d</i>. shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, may be inserted through holes <b>417</b><i>a </i>and <b>417</b><i>d</i>, respectively, and screwed into door <b>101</b>. The screws <b>427</b><i>a </i>and <b>427</b><i>d </i>may be termed an attachment device for attaching the pest control device <b>410</b> to the door <b>101</b>. Each of the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> can move from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> to the position shown in FIG. <b>2</b>B and anywhere in between. The door <b>101</b> is typically connected to a door lowering apparatus, not shown, known in the art for raising and lowering a warehouse roller door, or a garage door. The door <b>101</b> is lowered so that the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> come in contact with a ground or horizontal surface, such as surface <b>500</b>. The surface <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is uneven and has raised portions such as raised portion <b>500</b><i>a </i>and depressed portions such as depressed portion <b>500</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="P-00055" num="00055">Just before the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> come in contact with the surface <b>500</b> the pins are in the state shown in FIG. <b>2</b>B. I.e. all of the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> have their heads contacting surface <b>416</b><i>a </i>of the member <b>416</b>. The pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> have fallen downwards in the direction D as far downwards as they can go. As the door <b>101</b> is lowered some of the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> begin to come in contact with portions of the surface <b>500</b>. For example, pins <b>430</b><i>c </i>and <b>440</b><i>c </i>come into contact with raised portion <b>500</b><i>a </i>of the surface <b>500</b>. This causes pins <b>430</b><i>c </i>and <b>440</b><i>c </i>to be pushed upwards in the direction U. The pins <b>430</b><i>c </i>and <b>440</b><i>c </i>are pushed upwards in the direction U either until they hit the surface <b>412</b><i>b </i>of the top plate <b>412</b> or until the door <b>101</b> has been lowered an acceptable distance.</p>
<p id="P-00056" num="00056">Eventually the door <b>101</b> is lowered until other pins, such as pins <b>440</b><i>b </i>and <b>430</b><i>b </i>come in contact with the depressed portion <b>500</b><i>b </i>of the surface <b>500</b>. The pins <b>440</b><i>b </i>and <b>430</b><i>b </i>will be pushed upwards in the direction U, but not as far upwards as the pins <b>430</b><i>c </i>and <b>440</b><i>c</i>, because of the uneven surface <b>500</b>. The door <b>101</b> should be lowered until all the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> contact a portion of the surface <b>500</b>. As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, because all of the pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> contact a portion of the surface <b>500</b>, a fence is created which prevents pests, such as rodents, from getting into a building. The spacing W<b>1</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, between the adjacent pins in any of the rows of pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> should be as small as possible and may be one quarter of an inch. The spacing between one pin of pins <b>430</b> and the closest pin of pins <b>440</b>, such as between pins <b>430</b><i>a </i>and <b>440</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, should be much less due to the interleaving of rows of pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b>. The spacing between pins <b>430</b><i>a </i>and <b>440</b> may be one eighth of any inch. The pins can be made of metal such as steel, iron, or aluminum or any other suitable material. The pins <b>430</b>, <b>440</b>, and <b>450</b> typically will be perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the door <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00057" num="00057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows an apparatus <b>200</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention wherein a device <b>220</b> for raising and lowering the pest control device <b>10</b> (or the pest control device <b>410</b>) is provided, with the pest control device <b>10</b> shown in a raised position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows the second embodiment of the present invention with the pest control device <b>10</b> in a lowered position.

The elongated portion <b>222</b> of the L-shaped pipe <b>221</b> has a diameter smaller than the opening <b>244</b><i>a </i>in portion <b>244</b> to allow the elongated portion <b>222</b> to be inserted into the opening <b>244</b><i>a </i>of the portion <b>244</b> of the bracket <b>240</b> to allow the elongated portion <b>222</b> to slide up and down, in the directions U and D, within the opening <b>244</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="P-00059" num="00059">Similarly, the bracket <b>250</b> may be identical to the bracket <b>240</b> and may have a portion <b>252</b> and a portion <b>254</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 9B</figref>, which may be perpendicular to each other. The portion <b>252</b> may have openings <b>252</b><i>a </i>and <b>252</b><i>b </i>and the portion <b>254</b> may have an opening <b>254</b><i>a </i>as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-B</figref>. Screws <b>256</b> and <b>258</b> may be inserted through openings <b>252</b><i>a </i>and <b>252</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and screwed into the door <b>201</b> to mount the bracket <b>250</b> to the door <b>201</b>. The elongated portion <b>222</b> of the L-shaped pipe <b>221</b> has a diameter smaller than the opening <b>254</b><i>a </i>in portion <b>254</b> to allow the elongated portion <b>222</b> to be inserted into the opening <b>254</b><i>a </i>of the portion <b>254</b> of the bracket <b>250</b> and to allow the elongated portion <b>222</b> to slide up and down, in the directions U and D, within the opening <b>254</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="P-00060" num="00060">In operation the device <b>220</b> and the pest control device <b>10</b> can be placed in a raised position with respect to the door <b>201</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>9</b>A. In the raised position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the pest control device <b>210</b> remains above the bottom door surface <b>201</b><i>a</i>, and the pins <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, and <b>50</b> of the pest control device <b>10</b> will not touch a ground surface <b>350</b>. In the raised position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the notch <b>226</b><i>a </i>is on top of the body portion <b>230</b><i>b </i>of the screw <b>230</b>. The body portion <b>230</b><i>b </i>of the screw <b>230</b> prevents the L-shaped pipe <b>221</b> and the pest control device <b>10</b> from moving downwards in the direction D. The L-shaped pipe <b>221</b> is fixed at end <b>221</b><i>a</i>, which may be threaded, to the pest control device <b>10</b> by a nut <b>229</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00061" num="00061">The device <b>220</b> and the pest control device <b>10</b> can be placed in a lowered state by first slightly raising the L-shaped pipe <b>221</b> to take the extension <b>226</b> off of the screw <b>230</b>.

<heading id="heading-d0e1342" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">This invention relates to the field of termite control technology and more specifically to a novel method of controlling termite activity by the use of radio waves. More particularly, this invention provides a method of attracting termites to a desired location by the use of radio waves within a certain frequency range.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">2. Background of the Technology</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Untreated termite infestation in homes leads to irreversible structural damage in buildings throughout the world. As a result, a myriad of treatments to control or destroy termite populations have been developed. Because of the potential negative environmental impact of insecticides, environmentally friendly alternatives have been the primary focus of the latest research.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">A significant amount of prior art focuses on the use of electromagnetic fields to control (repel and/or negatively affect) termites. U.S. Pat. No. 5,473,836, issued to Liu discloses a method for removing insects from &#x201c;hidden places&#x201d; by inducing an electromagnetic field to create physical vibrations. U.S. Pat. No. 5,930,946 issued to Mah discloses a method for creating an to which pests react adversely. U.S. Pat. No. 5,442,876 issued to Pederson discloses a method for controlling termites by heating the area where termites are located to temperatures which are lethal to living organisms by means of electromagnetic energy. U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,779 issued to Bergerioux et al. discloses a method in which a low frequency, randomly varying magnetic field is generated by a device such that it interacts with the earth's geomagnetic field to eliminate (repel) rodents and similar pests located above and below ground level in the area surrounding the device.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">The use of electrical energy has also been employed in efforts to eliminate (repel and/or negatively affect) termites. U.S. Pat. No. 5,210,719 issued to Lawrence discloses an apparatus and method which uses a sweep-frequency, high voltage generator coupled to an applicator gun for feeding electric power into pest-infested dielectrics, for example termite-infested wood. U.S. Pat. No. 4,366,644 issued to Lawrence discloses a method that involves the application of broad band radio frequency or multifrequency high-voltage electrical energy to termite shelter tubes, galleries and nests and to the bodies of termites in those areas. Lawrence '644 teaches that by that method termites are killed directly by electroshock or indirectly by creating interference with the digestive processes of termites. U.S. Pat. No. 4,782,623 issued to Lawrence discloses an apparatus and phase-locked high voltage, high frequency pulse generator capable of &#x201c;quasiunlimited&#x201d; power output and an applicator gun for feeding electric power into pest-infested dielectrics, for example termite infested wood. U.S. Pat. No. 4,223,468 issued to Lawrence discloses a method that involves killing termi application of broad band, high voltage electrical energy to habitats of termites.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">The application of microwave energy has also been employed in the attempt to control (repel and/or negatively affect) termites. U.S. Pat. No. 5,575,106 issued to Martin et al. discloses a method of using low voltage &#x201c;microwave horns&#x201d; to kill termite populations. U.S. Pat. No. 5,896,696 issued to Stokes et al. discloses an apparatus and method for generating and radiating energy at specific wavelengths for the purpose of adversely affecting the nervous systems of &#x201c;small insects.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">While recent efforts to discover environmentally friendly methods of controlling termites have sought to avoid the use of conventional pesticides; they have failed to adequately protect termite-susceptible structures from infestation. Both conventional chemical and more modem methods alike seek to deal with the problem of termite infestation by killing termites in the area that is infested rather than providing a method by which termite infestation and subsequent structural damage can be prevented. The inventors have discovered a novel method by which the application of radio waves to a selected area can attract termites to that area and thereby provide protection from termites for other adjacent areas.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1387" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">This invention relates to a method of controlling termite activity by emitting radio waves that attract termites to toxic baits, light traps, etc. or directing their movements away from susceptible structures.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a system for transmitting radio waves of specific frequencies to an area where termite activity is desired.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">It is also an object of this invention to use detection devices that monitor radio waves and/or energy levels of specific frequencies as a means to determine which structures are likely to attract termites.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1489" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">The present invention as described below and shown in the accompanying figures is a novel method of attracting termites that is employed to provide a method of controlling termite activity by emitting radio waves of a certain frequency.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-D</figref> the radio wave transmitting system of the present invention, generally shown at <b>10</b>, can be configured to position at least one transmitting device <b>12</b> in a transmission area <b>14</b> where termite activity is desired. A radio transmitter <b>16</b> is designed to provide a broadcast radio signal of a certain wave length within a transmission area <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1C</figref> the transmitter <b>16</b> can be operationally connected to more than one transmitting device <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-D</figref>, the radio wave transmitting system of the present invention can have varied configurations where the transmitting devices <b>12</b> can be positioned adjacent to or circumferentially disposed around a natural or man-made termite-degradable structure <b>18</b> for which protection from termite damage is desired. The structure <b>18</b> can have a degradable component and therefore be susceptible to termite damage. The different transmitting system configurations depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-D</figref> are non-limiting examples, the pattern of which can be widely varied without departing from the concept of the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">Within the effective range of the transmission area <b>14</b> natural or man-made termite-degradable materials can be positioned so as to provide an attractant <b>20</b> for termites that is localized within the transmission area <b>14</b>. Inclusion of the attractant <b>20</b>, in addition to increasing the effectiveness of the termite-attraction of the transmitting device <b>12</b>, also provides foci for termite infestation in the transmission area <b>14</b>. By focusing the relocation of the termites to the attractant <b>20</b>, subsequent containment, collection, or elimination of the termites by conventional means can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">The transmitter <b>16</b> of the present invention can be any conventional radio wave transmitter capable of transmitting radio waves having a frequency range of about 1 to 100 megahertz and preferably 1 to 30 megahertz. The intensity of the radio wave transmission can be about</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">After conducting tests over a 10-year period, the inventors discovered that termites are attracted to radio waves within a certain frequency range and broadcast intensity. The inventors discovered that termites such as <i>Coptotermes formosanus </i>are attracted to radio waves such as those employed in the present invention. Species such as <i>Coptotermes, Reticulitermes</i>and other termite genera can be susceptible to the attraction qualities of the present invention. Unlike conventional remedial termite control methods, the present invention provides a method to control subterranean, surface, and dispersal flight movement of termites before infestation of an area in need of protection. The inclusion of attraction augmentation in the transmitting system <b>10</b> of the present invention further permits the localization of the termites within the transmission area. The optional attractant <b>20</b> used in the transmitting system <b>10</b> can be any material to which termites can be attracted, to include, for example natural or man-made wooden items, bait stations, or any object with a termite-degradable component.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">The present invention can be used to attract termites to the transmission area <b>14</b> for containment, collection and study, or elimination. By properly positioning the transmitting system <b>10</b> relative to a natural or man-made structure <b>18</b> for which termite protection is desired, the termites can be attracted away from the material or structure <b>18</b> that is to be protected and drawn towards the transmitting system <b>10</b>. Non-limiting examples of transmitting system configurations which can be used to provide protection for a material or object, such as a house, fence, utility pole, or any material subject to termite infestation are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-D</figref>.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1722" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Field observations of the natural populations of the termite <i>Coptotermes formosanus </i>on the Lualualei Naval facility, Oahu, Hi. were conducted over a 10-year test period. These field observations indicated that movements of this subterranean termite are affected by radio waves of a frequency about 1-100 megahertz, preferably about 1-30 megahertz, and more preferably about 2-20 megahertz. The intensity of the radio transmission can be about 1-100 kilowatts; preferably about 1-10 kilowatts. Antenna arrays were formed of wires supported by large pressure-treated Douglas-fir wooden poles and were located over a large portion of the facility. The frequency of the radio waves ranged from about 1-100 megahertz at transmission intensities from about 1-100 kilowatts.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a diagrammatic representation of the disposition of antenna arrays within the test area. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref>, the diagram of the test area is divided into an eastern and a western portion by a dashed-line. The locations of numerous radio transmitters <b>16</b> connected by transmission lines <b>22</b> to circumferentially disposed antenna arrays or transmission devices <b>12</b> are shown throughout the test area. Antenna arrays <b>12</b> in the eastern portion of the test area were actively transmitting radio waves during the first six years of the 10-year test period (between 1992 and 1998). Those antenna arrays west of the dashed-line were inactive for several years prior to the test period. After the inspection for termite activity in 1998, the antenna arrays <b>12</b> in the western portion of the test area were actively transmitting for the last four years of the 10-year test period (between 1998 and 2002). Numerous areas of identified termite activity <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref> as shaded areas were identified by the inventors during inspections in 1998 and subsequently in 2002. As depicted in the diagrams, new termite activity was identified in those areas where antenna arrays <b>12</b> were actively transmitting while new termite activity was not found in areas with inactive antenna arrays.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a diagram of antenna arrays associated with a radio transmitter and the location of wooden poles, which served as termite attractants <b>20</b> in the area of the antenna arrays <b>12</b>. Identified termite activity at the attractant <b>20</b> is shown as a shaded area. As shown in the diagram, the inventors identified a high level of termite infestation of wooden poles <b>20</b> placed along the transmission line <b>22</b>, which operationally connects a remote radio transmitter <b>16</b> to the active antenna array <b>12</b> (antenna array number <b>442</b>).</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">As discussed earlier, antennas arrays in the eastern portion of the test area were actively transmitting whereas antennas in the western portion of the facility remained inactive during the first six years of the test. Those active antenna arrays having the best attraction for termites broadcast a frequency of about 2-30 megahertz at an intensity of about 1 to 10 kilowatts. For those antenna arrays having the best attraction of termites, the average frequency transmitted was about 9 megahertz at an average intensity of about 4 kilowatts. The antenna arrays broadcasting in the lower frequencies and lower intensities can have an effective attraction distance in excess of 100 feet from the antenna arrays. The effective distance of the termite attraction effect of the antenna arrays is believed to vary with increased radio wave frequency and intensity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-G</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-H</figref> provide an indication of the termite attraction effect of the inactive and active antenna arrays <b>12</b>. Circumferentially disposed around the individual antenna arrays were wooden poles that served as an attractant <b>20</b> within the transmission area <b>14</b>. These attractant poles <b>20</b> provided a foci for the termites attracted by the antenna arrays system of the present invention and permitted the inventors to measure the effect of the transmitted radio waves. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-G</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-H</figref>, it can been seen that the attractant poles <b>20</b> that were disposed near active antenna arrays <b>12</b> were observed to have different amounts of termite infestation while those inactive antenna arrays <b>12</b> had reduced or no termite infestation.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">The results of the years of testing the radio wave transmitting system <b>10</b> of the present invention demonstrated the ability of the system to attract termites by the use of radio wave transmission. The test also showed that by attracting termites to the transmitting system <b>10</b>, adjacent wooden structures could be protected from termite infestation.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">The present invention can be employed to attract termites to an active transmitting device <b>12</b> and by doing so protect an adjacent area from termite infestation. The invention can also be employed as a method to increase the efficiency of other devices used to attract insects such as the conventional light traps, termite traps, bait stations and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">It is also within the concept of the present invention to employ the inventor's discovery of the termite-attractant ability of a radio wave transmitting system <b>10</b> to provide an electronic sweeper that can identify structures or buildings that are more susceptible to termite infestation due to the emission of attractant radio waves.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">The discovery of the inventors can also be used to provide a device that scrambles or &#x201c;masks&#x201d; the emission of attractant radio waves from termite susceptible structures or buildings.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The inventors have also determined that the effect of radio waves on termites can be adapted to produce a high intensity electronic field at or about 60 hertz and 20 megawatts to create a repellant shield around susceptible structures.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">The invention claimed herein has been described generically, and by reference to specific embodiments. Examples and specific features are not intended to be limiting unless so indicated above. Modifications will occur to those of skill in the art without departing from the invention, except as excluded by the claims set forth below.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e767" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The invention consists of a modular type tray for hydroponic and aeroponic cultivation, in which the nutritive solution is carried to the roots of plants grown in the tray by a tube with built-in drips situated in a slot on the tray bottom.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The tray consists of at least one plastic casing made by extrusion, a pair of closing flanges to apply to the opposite ends of the tray and (if necessary) at least one middle flange, placed between two plastic casings to join them together with a watertight seal.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="heading-00004">Previous Technique</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Systems for hydroponic and aeroponic cultivation are known and widely used for some time which include a large number of fixed or moveable trays usually situated inside one or more greenhouses: the plants are held and carried by support means belonging to the trays so that their roots stick out from the support means inside the trays.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">To provide the plants with water and nutrients necessary for their growth, their roots are supplied with a nutritive solution (coming from one or more containers) which, in the known type systems, is regularly put in the tray area underlying the plant support means by tubes with nozzles (or other equivalent means) situated on the tray bottoms.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">The known systems for aeroponic cultivation have (or may have) high system and running costs due to the fact that (very often) the prototype stage has not been surpassed and/or that complicated and expensive engineering solutions have been adopted which are not justified by any benefits gained.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">In addition, the use of tubes with sprinkler nozzles to carry the nutritive solution to the plant roots needs the solution to be under pressure (typically at 2-3 atmospheres): this entails (or may entail) considerable costs for the realisation and operation of the nutritive solution delivery circuit, since it is necessary to use fairly powerful pumps (with high energy consumption) to pressurize the nutritive solution and make it circulate, as well as choose the appropriate connection parts between the various tube pieces and make the connections carefully so as to avoid breaks in the connection parts and/or leaks of the pressurized fluid, and so on.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">Extensive studies and research carried out by the applicant have shown that, without undermining the characteristics (productivity, etc.) of a hydroponic and aeroponic cultivation system, it is possible to replace the tubes having sprinkler nozzles used in known type trays with tubes having built-in drips, situated on the tray bottom, which have the advantage of supplying a nutritive solution at ambient pressure, allowing less powerful circulation pumps to be used (with lower energy consumption) to circulate the nutritive solution, and the use of less robust connection parts between the various tube pieces (and, accordingly, less expensive) and reduce the times (and, accordingly, the costs) necessary to carry out the same joints.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Subject of the present invention is a tray for hydroponic and aeroponic cultivation, capable of being produced on an industrial scale, that allows optimum plant cultivation by carrying the nutritive solution to their roots through tubes with built-in drips situated on the tray bottom, thus overcoming and/or eliminating the limitations and/or defects experienced previously by known type trays for hydroponic and aeroponic cultivation.</p>

<p id="P-00011" num="00011">The subject of the present invention is a modular type tray for hydroponic and aeroponic cultivation, in which the nutritive solution is brought to the roots of plants grown by a tube with built-in drips situated in a slot made on the tray bottom.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e915" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">The subject of the present invention is a tray <b>1</b> for hydroponic and aeroponic cultivation, in which the nutritive solution is carried to the roots of the plants grown by a tube with built-in drops <b>2</b> situated in a slot <b>3</b> made on the tray bottom <b>1</b>. Such plants are held by support means that close the upper opening of tray <b>1</b>; an embodiment of such support means will be described as a non-limiting example with reference to FIG. <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">The nutritive solution which remains unabsorbed by the plant roots collects on the tray bottom <b>1</b>, from where it flows out through a hole made in the tray bottom <b>1</b> and a tube applied to such hole and/or in another way in itself known; in the enclosed figures the means for the outflow of the nutritive solution have been omitted for simplicity of graphic representation.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a perspective view of a non-limiting embodiment of a modular type tray <b>1</b>, made according to the invention: in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the tray <b>1</b> includes a pair of casings <b>4</b> (<b>4</b>,&#x2032; <b>4</b>&#x2033;) joined together but, without leading away from the scope of the invention, tray <b>1</b> can include a single casing <b>4</b> or three or more casings <b>4</b> to adapt itself better to the specific needs of each user.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e416" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention relates to a window covering and, more particularly, to a wooden shutter for a window.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">A conventional wooden shutter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is generally comprised of an outer frame <b>1</b>, a set of louvers <b>2</b>, and a control rod <b>3</b>. The outer frame <b>1</b> is a rectangular open frame. The louvers <b>2</b> are transversely arranged in parallel within the outer frame <b>1</b>. The control rod <b>3</b> is coupled to one lateral side of each of the louvers <b>2</b> for operation by hand to tilt the louvers <b>2</b> and to adjust the gap between each two adjacent louvers <b>2</b>. Before installation of the shutter in a window, ornamental strips <b>4</b> are fixedly fastened to the wall around the four sides of the window, and then hinges <b>5</b>, for enabling the shutter to be turned in and out of the window, hinge one vertical side of the outer frame <b>1</b> to one vertical extended ornamental strip <b>4</b>. This structure of down shutter is still not satisfactory in function because of the following drawbacks.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">1. Because the hinges <b>5</b> are visible when fastened to the outer frame <b>1</b> and the ornamental strip <b>4</b> (see FIG. <b>1</b>), they destroy the sense of beauty of the wooden shutter. Further, only a specially trained technician can accurately install the hinges <b>5</b> in position. If the hinges <b>5</b> are not accurately installed in position, the wooden shutter cannot be smoothly opened and closed.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">2. Before installation of the ornamental strip <b>4</b>, the wall must be polished so that the ornamental strip <b>4</b> can closely attached to the wall. This polishing job requires techniques. The user may have to hide a professional technician to do the job.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">3. The wooden shutter is expensive because it is made subject to the size of the window in which the wooden shutter is to be installed. Because of custom made, much fabrication and installation time is needed.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">4. The ornamental strips provided around the four sides of the window are mitered. If the mitered joint between each two adjacent ornamental strips is not precisely engineered, the mitered joint tends to be damaged during delivery of the wooden shutter, resulting in a bad looking.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">5. The ornamental strips <b>4</b> are provided to make the wooden shutter look better. However, when a screw nail <b>6</b> driven through one ornamental strip <b>4</b> into the wall W as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the head <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the screw nail <b>6</b> is exposed to the outside, destroying the sense of beauty of the ornamental strip.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e642" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances in view. It is the main object of the present invention to provide a wooden shutter that has a nice looking when installed.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">It is another object of the present invention to provide a simple and inexpensive wooden shutter that can easily detachably installed in the window by the user.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">To achieve these objects of the present invention, the wooden shutter comprises an outer frame defining a receiving open space, a plurality of louvers arranged in parallel in the receiving open space, a first coupling unit and a second coupling unit.

The top block <b>11</b>, the first and second stiles <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, and the bottom block <b>14</b> define a rectangular receiving open space.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">The louvers <b>20</b> are long, thin, narrow pieces of wood transversely arranged in parallel within the rectangular receiving open space of the outer frame <b>10</b> at different elevations, each having two distal ends respectively fastened pivotally with the inner sides of the first and second stiles <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> of the outer frame <b>10</b>, for enabling the louvers <b>20</b> to be synchronously tilted. The control rod <b>30</b> is coupled to the outer lateral sides of the louvers <b>20</b> and equally spaced between the stiles <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> for operation by hand to tilt the louvers <b>20</b> and to further adjust the gap between each two adjacent louvers <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">The first and second coupling units <b>40</b> and <b>50</b> are connected between the outer frame <b>10</b> and the wall around a window to pivotally secure the wooden shutter <b>100</b> to the window, for enabling the wooden shutter <b>100</b> to be turned in and out of the window. The first coupling unit <b>40</b> comprises a mounting plate <b>41</b>, a fixed pivot member <b>42</b>, and a packing pad <b>43</b>. The mounting plate <b>41</b> is an angled tough plate having a mounting portion <b>411</b> and a bearing portion <b>412</b> arranged at right angles. The mounting portion <b>411</b> has a plurality of mounting holes <b>413</b>. The fixed pivot member <b>42</b> is a round pivot pin vertically formed integral with the bearing portion <b>412</b> at a predetermined location. The packing pad <b>43</b> is made of wear resistant material of low friction coefficient and fixedly fastened to the bottom end of the first stile <b>12</b> by screws, having a through hole <b>431</b> corresponding to the bottom mounting portion <b>16</b> of the first stile <b>12</b> so that the pivot member <b>42</b> can be inserted through the through hole <b>431</b> of the packing pad <b>43</b> into the bottom mounting portion <b>16</b>. The second coupling unit <b>50</b> comprises a mounting plate <b>51</b>, a movable pivot member <b>52</b>, and a packing pad <b>53</b>. The mounting plate <b>51</b> is an angled tough plate having a mounting portion <b>511</b> and a bearing portion <b>512</b> arranged at right angles. The mounting portion <b>511</b> has a plurality of mounting holes <b>513</b>. The bearing portion <b>512</b> has a through hole <b>514</b>. The movable pivot member <b>52</b> is an independent round pivot pin that can be inserted through the through hole <b>514</b>. The packing pad <b>53</b> is made of wear resistant material of low friction coefficient and fixedly fastened to the top end of the first stile <b>12</b> by screws, having a through hole <b>531</b> corresponding to the top mounting portion <b>12</b> of the first stile <b>12</b> so that the pivot member <b>52</b> can be inserted through the through hole <b>531</b> of the packing pad <b>53</b> into the top mounting portion <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">The installation of the wooden shutter <b>100</b> is outlined hereinafter with reference to FIGS. <b>3</b>&#x2dc;<b>5</b>. According to the present installation example, the wooden shutter <b>100</b> is installed in the outer side of the window. At first, the mounting plate <b>41</b> of the first coupling unit <b>40</b> and the mounting plate <b>51</b> of the second coupling unit <b>50</b> are respectively attached to the outer surface of the wall around the window near the bottom and top sides of the window, and then fastening elements <b>60</b> are respectively inserted into the mounting holes <b>413</b> and <b>513</b> of the mounting plates <b>41</b> and <b>51</b> and driven into the wall around the window to fixedly secure the mounting plates <b>41</b> and <b>51</b> to the wall, and then the top block <b>11</b>, the stiles <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, the bottom block <b>14</b>, the louvers <b>20</b>, and the control rod <b>30</b> are assembled, and then the assembled wooden shutter <b>100</b> is set between the bearing portions <b>412</b> and <b>512</b> of the mounting plates <b>41</b> and <b>51</b> to force the fixed pivot member <b>42</b> through the through hole <b>431</b> of the packing pad <b>43</b> at the bottom end of the first stile <b>12</b> into the bottom mounting portion <b>16</b>, and then the top mounting portion <b>15</b> of the first stile <b>12</b> is aimed at the through hole <b>514</b> of the bearing portion <b>512</b> of the mounting plate <b>51</b> of the second coupling unit <b>50</b>, and then the movable pivot member <b>52</b> is inserted through the through hole <b>514</b> of the bearing portion <b>512</b> and the through hole <b>531</b> of the packing pad <b>53</b> at the top end of the first stile <b>12</b> into the top mounting portion <b>15</b>. By means of the first coupling unit <b>40</b> and the second coupling unit <b>50</b>, the first stile <b>12</b> of the wooden shutter <b>100</b> is pivotally fastened to the wall at one side of the window, and the user can turn the wooden shutter <b>100</b> about the axis passing through the first stile <b>12</b>. When wishing to detach the outer frame <b>10</b> from the window, remove the movable pivot member <b>52</b> from the through hole <b>514</b> of the mounting plate <b>51</b> of the second coupling unit <b>50</b> to disengage the connection between the top mounting portion <b>15</b> of the first stile <b>12</b> and the mounting plate <b>51</b> of the second coupling unit <b>50</b>, and then the outer frame <b>10</b> is pulled upwards to disengage the bottom mounting portion <b>16</b> of the first stile <b>12</b> from the fixed pivot member <b>42</b> at the mounting plate <b>41</b> of the first coupling unit <b>40</b>. By means of the aforesaid arrangement, the user can mount/dismount the wooden shutter <b>100</b> easily.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">As indicated above, the packing pads <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> are made of wear resistant material of low friction resistance. When the first stile <b>12</b> turned relative to the mounting plates <b>41</b> and <b>51</b>, the packing pads <b>43</b> and <b>53</b> buffer friction between the first stile <b>12</b> and the mounting plates <b>41</b> and <b>51</b>. Therefore, the wooden shutter <b>100</b> can smoothly be turned in and out of the window with less effort without noises.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the outer frame <b>10</b> is not directly attached to the wall around the window. The mounting portions <b>411</b> and <b>511</b> of the mounting plates <b>41</b> and <b>51</b> keep the outer frame <b>10</b> from the wall around the window at a distance. Therefore, the uneven wall surface of the wall around the window does not interfere with the installation of the wooden shutter <b>100</b>. Because the mounting portions <b>411</b> and <b>511</b> have a limited thickness, the limited gap between the outer frame <b>10</b> and the wall around the window is not obvious. In order to cause a sense of beauty, a flexible packing strip <b>61</b> is sealed in the gap between the outer frame <b>10</b> and the wall around the window. Preferably, the packing strip <b>61</b> is made of rubber or elastic material. Further, the positions of the pivot members <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> in the mounting plates <b>41</b> and <b>51</b> of the first and second coupling units <b>40</b> and <b>50</b> and the positions of the top and bottom mounting portions <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> in the top and bottom ends of the first stile <b>12</b> are so determined that no interference is produced between the outer frame <b>10</b> and the mounting plates <b>41</b> and <b>51</b> upon pivot motion of the outer frame <b>10</b>. The positions of the related members are defined hereinafter (because the relative position between the movable pivot member <b>52</b> and the top mounting portion <b>15</b> is similar to the relative position between the fixed pivot member <b>42</b> and the bottom mounting portion <b>15</b>, only the relative position between the fixed pivot member <b>42</b> and the bottom mounting portion <b>16</b> is described):</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the bearing portion <b>412</b> defines a boundary having a first side <b>416</b>, a second side <b>417</b>, a third side <b>418</b>, and a fourth side <b>419</b>. The first side <b>416</b> joins the mounting portion <b>411</b>. The second side <b>417</b> is opposite to the first side <b>416</b>. The third side <b>418</b> is connected between the first side <b>416</b> and the second side <b>417</b> at an inner side (the right side in FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>). The fourth side <b>419</b> is connected between the first side <b>416</b> and the second side <b>417</b> at an outer side (the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) opposite to the third side <b>418</b>. When the outer frame <b>10</b> set in the close position (in the window), the border of the bottom end of the stile <b>12</b> forming the bottom mounting portion <b>16</b> defines a fifth side <b>121</b>, a sixth side <b>122</b>, a seventh side <b>123</b>, and an eighth side <b>124</b> corresponding to the first side <b>416</b>, the second side <b>417</b>, the third side <b>418</b>, and the fourth side <b>419</b> respectively. When the position of the bottom mounting portion <b>16</b> of the first stile <b>12</b> matches the position of the fixed pivot member <b>42</b>, i.e., when the outer frame <b>10</b> set in the close position (in the window), the distance R<b>1</b> between the axis of the fixed pivot member <b>42</b> and the first side <b>416</b> is greater than the distance R<b>2</b> between the center of the bottom mounting portion <b>16</b> and the connection area between the fifth side <b>121</b> and the eighth side <b>124</b> (the distance R<b>2</b> is also equal to the maximum radius of gyration of the corner angle of the first stile <b>12</b>) so that a certain gap is left between the first mounting portion <b>411</b> of the mounting plate <b>41</b> and the connection area between the fifth side <b>121</b> and eight side <b>124</b> of the first stile <b>12</b> when the first stile <b>12</b> turned with the outer frame <b>10</b> to any position within about 180&#xb0; between the close position and the open position (see FIG. <b>8</b>), preventing interference between the first stile <b>12</b> and the mounting plate <b>41</b>. Further, because the distance R<b>1</b> is slightly greater than the distance R<b>2</b>, the gap G<b>1</b> between the first side <b>416</b> of the mounting plate <b>41</b> and the fifth side <b>121</b> of the first stile <b>12</b> is maintained minimized when the first stile <b>12</b> turned with the outer frame <b>10</b> to any position within about 180&#xb0; between the close position and the open position. Therefore, a nice looking is constantly maintained when the outer frame <b>10</b> turned to any angular position between the open status and the close status.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">Further, the position of the fixed pivot member <b>42</b> in the mounting plate <b>41</b> should be close to the second side <b>417</b> as well as the fourth side <b>419</b> (i.e., the position of the fixed pivot member <b>42</b> must be close to the connection area between the second side <b>417</b> and the fourth side <b>419</b>), keeping the distance R<b>3</b> between the axis of the fixed pivot member <b>42</b> and the fourth side <b>419</b> less than or equal to the distance R<b>4</b> between the center of the bottom mounting portion <b>16</b> and the eighth side <b>124</b>, so that the fourth side <b>419</b> of the mounting plate <b>41</b> does not protrude over the eighth side <b>124</b> of the first stile <b>12</b> when the outer frame <b>10</b> turned to the close position (in the window). The distance R<b>5</b> between the axis of the fixed pivot member <b>42</b> and the second side <b>417</b> should be smaller than the distance R<b>6</b> between the center of the bottom mounting portion <b>16</b> and the sixth side <b>122</b>, so that the second side <b>417</b> of the mounting plate <b>41</b> does not protrude over the sixth side <b>122</b> of the first stile <b>12</b> when the outer frame <b>10</b> turned to the close position (in the window). In other words, when the wooden shutter <b>100</b> set in the window, the second side <b>417</b> and fourth side <b>419</b> of the mounting plate <b>41</b> do not protrude over the sixth side <b>122</b> and eighth side <b>124</b> of the first stile <b>12</b>, keeping a nice looking.</p>

<p id="P-00004" num="00004">The present invention relates to a keeper for a casement window assembly. More specifically, the present invention relates to a keeper having a unique structure that improves the overall strength and rigidity of the keeper.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1505" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Casement window assemblies are well-known within the window industry. Generally, the casement window assembly includes a rectangular frame assembly and a window assembly. The frame assembly supports the window assembly when the window assembly is in either a closed position or an open position. The window assembly includes a glass pane supported by a plurality of frame members. The frame assembly includes a plurality of frame members and a lock assembly. The lock assembly includes a keeper and related hardware, including a pin, a handle, and a rotary device. The keeper is generally mounted to one of the frame members of the window assembly. Typically, the pin is affixed to an interior portion of one frame member and coupled to the handle. The pin engages the keeper when the window assembly is in the closed or nearly-closed position. The rotary device permits a user to move the window assembly between opened and closed positions.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">In conventional window assemblies, the keeper is cooperatively positioned with the pin such that the keeper receives the pin when the user actuates the handle. Prior to actuating the handle, the user rotates the rotary device to move the window assembly from the open position to the closed position. Similarly, the keeper disengages the pin when the user actuates the handle and rotates the handle to move the window assembly from the closed position to the open position. The engagement between the keeper and the pin is essential to secure the window assembly in the closed position.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">In the window industry, a number of tests are utilized to evaluate the strength of the casement window assembly, including the keeper. One such test evaluates the strength of the keeper by applying a progressive amount of force to the keeper until it fails. A keeper fails the test when it deforms such that it can no longer engage the pin and, as a result, no longer secure the window assembly. Conventional keepers can withstand approximately 250 pounds of force or loading.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">In another type of test, commonly referred to as an impact/cycle test, a projectile impacts the window assembly in two spots. The window assembly is then pressure-cycled to ensure that it does not open in a simulated hurricane. To meet this strength standard, manufacturers of casement window assemblies typically utilize a plurality of conventional keepers, often more than three sets of keepers and pins per casement window assembly. This significantly increases the cost of the window hardware and as a result, the cost of the casement window assembly.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">Consequently, there is a need for a keeper having increased strength such that less hardware is necessary for the casement window assembly to meet the industry standards for strength. The present invention is provided to solve these and other deficiencies.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1535" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">The present invention relates to a keeper for use in a casement window assembly, which includes a frame assembly and a window assembly. The window assembly includes a glass pane supported by a plurality of frame members. The keeper is mounted to one of the frame members of the window assembly. The frame assembly includes a plurality of frame members. The frame assembly includes a rotary device adapted to move the window assembly between an open position and a closed position. The casement window assembly further has a lock assembly. The lock assembly includes the keeper, a pin, and a retainer. The pin extends from a lock bar, which is slidably mounted by the retainer to an interior portion of one frame member. The pin is adapted to engage the keeper when the window assembly is in the closed or nearly-closed position.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">The keeper has a first portion, a second portion, an intermediate portion, and a slot or recess. The first portion of the keeper has a first aperture and a second aperture, wherein each aperture is adapted to receive a fastener to secure the keeper to the window frame member. The first portion has a rounded upper segment, an intermediate segment, and a rounded lower segment. Also, the first portion has a mounting surface that contacts a portion of the window frame member when the keeper is affixed to the frame member.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">The second portion of the keeper has an elongated finger extending from an upper segment of the second portion. The finger is adapted to slidingly engage a portion of the pin when the window assembly is moved from the closed position to the open position, or from the open position to the closed position. The second portion has an interior edge that abuts the intermediate portion. The keeper is preferably configured such that the second portion is oriented generally perpendicular to the first portion.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">The intermediate portion of the keeper is positioned between the interior edge of the first portion and the interior edge of the second portion. Unlike conventional devices, a rib extends from an upper segment of the intermediate portion. The rib is an elongated structure that increases the structural integrity or strength of the keeper. The rib is positioned adjacent to the interior edge of the first portion. In addition, the rib is generally aligned with the intermediate segment of the first portion. When viewed in cross-section, the contact between the rib and the first portion defines an &#x201c;L-shaped&#x201d; structure. The rib has a sloped or tapered configuration, meaning that its top and bottom segments do not share the same geometry. The keeper is preferably configured such that the intermediate portion is oriented generally perpendicular to the first portion.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">The slot is generally positioned between the finger of the second portion and the rib of the intermediate portion. The slot is adapted to slidingly engage a portion of the pin when the window assembly is moved from the closed position to the open position, or from the open position to the closed position. The slot has a pair of interior edges and an apex portion.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">Conventional keeper designs lack the rib of the present invention. Since the rib is positioned along or makes contact with an extent of the first portion, the rib dramatically increases the strength of the keeper. In addition, the rib alters the configuration of the keeper.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following specification taken in conjunction with the following drawings.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1683" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail preferred embodiments of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention to the embodiments illustrated.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a casement window assembly <b>10</b> which includes a frame assembly <b>14</b> and a window assembly <b>16</b>. A pair of keepers <b>18</b> are shown mounted to the window assembly <b>16</b>. The window assembly <b>16</b> includes a glass pane <b>22</b> that is supported by a top window frame member <b>23</b>, a bottom window frame member <b>24</b>, a left window frame member <b>25</b>, and a right window frame member <b>26</b>. Although two keepers <b>18</b> are shown, the number of keepers <b>18</b> varies with the design parameters of the casement assembly <b>10</b> including the size and configuration of the frame and window assemblies <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. It is understood that the window assembly <b>16</b> can be configured to open from either side of the frame assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">The frame assembly <b>14</b> includes atop horizontal frame member <b>27</b>, a bottom horizontal frame member or sill <b>28</b>, a left vertical frame member or left jamb <b>29</b>, and a right vertical frame member or right jamb <b>30</b>. The frame assembly <b>14</b> further includes a rotary device or actuator <b>32</b> with a handle <b>34</b> extending from a base <b>36</b>. The rotary device <b>32</b> also includes a pair of links <b>37</b> coupled to the handle <b>34</b>. The rotary device <b>32</b> is adapted to move the window assembly <b>16</b> in the frame assembly <b>14</b> between an open position and a closed position.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the casement window assembly <b>10</b> further includes a lock assembly <b>15</b>. Whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a window assembly that opens left, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a window assembly that opens right. The lock assembly <b>15</b> generally comprises the keeper <b>18</b>, an engaging member or pin <b>38</b>, a lock bar <b>40</b>, and a retainer <b>42</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the keeper <b>18</b> is affixed to an interior portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the left window frame member <b>25</b>. The pin <b>38</b> is adapted to engage the keeper <b>18</b> when the window assembly <b>16</b> is in a closed or nearly-closed position. The pin <b>38</b> extends substantially perpendicular from the lock bar <b>40</b>, which is slidably mounted to an interior portion <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the left vertical frame member <b>29</b>. The pin <b>38</b> can be fastened to the lock bar <b>40</b>, or it can be integrally formed with the lock bar <b>40</b>. The lock bar <b>40</b> is slidably mounted to the frame member <b>29</b> by at least one retainer <b>42</b>. A second retainer (not shown) can be positioned above the pin <b>38</b> to provide additional slidable support to the lock bar <b>40</b>. The number of retainers <b>42</b> varies with the design parameters of the window assembly <b>10</b>, including the size and configuration of the lock bar <b>40</b>, the pin <b>38</b>, and the keeper <b>18</b>. The retainer <b>42</b> has a plurality of apertures <b>44</b> adapted to receive a fastener that affixes the retainer <b>42</b> to the frame member <b>29</b>. The retainer <b>42</b> also has a channel (not shown) adapted to receive a portion of the lock bar <b>40</b>. The channel of the retainer <b>42</b> receives a lower portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>of the lock bar <b>40</b> and provides slidable support to the lock bar <b>40</b> in a substantially vertical direction. The lock assembly <b>15</b> further includes a bezel <b>46</b> and a handle <b>48</b> positioned on the left frame member <b>29</b>. The bezel <b>46</b> and the handle <b>48</b> are coupled to the lock bar <b>40</b> at its lower portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>by a link <b>50</b> and a tenon <b>52</b>. The bezel <b>46</b> is adapted to be flush mounted in the frame member <b>29</b> with the handle <b>48</b> extending therefrom.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the window assembly <b>16</b> is in the open position. To place the casement window assembly <b>10</b> in the closed position, the user rotates the rotary device <b>32</b> to position the window assembly <b>16</b> substantially proximate the frame assembly <b>14</b>. To place the casement window assembly <b>10</b> in a locked position, the user actuates the handle <b>48</b> an initial amount whereby the lock bar <b>40</b> and the pin <b>38</b> are vertically displaced towards the keeper <b>18</b>. The user continues to actuate the handle <b>48</b> in a generally downward direction until the pin <b>38</b> engages or is received by the keeper <b>18</b>. The engagement between the keeper and the pin is essential to secure the window assembly in the locked position. It follows that the keeper <b>18</b> is secured to the right window frame member <b>26</b> a distance above the bottom sill <b>28</b> such that the keeper <b>18</b> can receive the pin <b>38</b> when the handle <b>48</b> is actuated. To place the casement window assembly <b>10</b> in the open position, the user actuates the handle <b>48</b> in a generally upward direction such that the lock bar <b>40</b> and the pin <b>38</b> move downward and whereby the pin <b>38</b> disengages the keeper <b>18</b>. Once the keeper <b>18</b> and the pin <b>38</b> are no longer engaged, the user rotates handle <b>34</b> of the rotary device <b>32</b> to move the window assembly <b>16</b> to the open position.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the keeper <b>18</b> generally has a first portion <b>54</b>, a second portion <b>56</b>, an intermediate portion <b>58</b>, and a slot or recess <b>59</b>. The keeper <b>18</b> has a thickness <i>t</i>, which can vary with the design parameters of the casement assembly <b>18</b> including the pin <b>38</b>. The first portion <b>54</b> of the keeper <b>18</b> has a first aperture <b>60</b> and a second aperture <b>61</b>, each adapted to receive a fastener to secure the keeper <b>18</b> to the window frame member <b>25</b> (see FIG. <b>2</b>). The number and size of apertures can vary with the design parameters of the keeper <b>18</b>. The first portion <b>54</b> has a rounded upper segment <b>62</b>, an intermediate segment <b>63</b>, and a rounded lower segment <b>64</b>. In addition, the first portion <b>54</b> has an exterior edge <b>66</b>. The first portion <b>54</b> also has an interior edge <b>68</b> that abuts the intermediate portion <b>58</b>. The first portion <b>54</b> has a mounting surface <b>70</b> that contacts a portion of the window frame member <b>25</b> when the keeper <b>18</b> is affixed to the frame member <b>25</b>. Preferably, the first portion <b>54</b> of the keeper <b>18</b> has a generally rectangular configuration.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">The second portion <b>56</b> of the keeper <b>18</b> has an elongated finger <b>72</b> extending from an upper segment <b>74</b> of the second portion <b>56</b>. The finger <b>72</b> has a tip segment <b>76</b>, a nose segment <b>78</b>, and an exterior edge <b>80</b>. The finger <b>72</b> is adapted to slidingly engage a portion of the pin <b>38</b> when the window assembly <b>16</b> is moved from the closed position to the open position, or from the open position to the closed position. The second portion <b>56</b> has an interior edge <b>82</b> that abuts the intermediate portion <b>58</b>. Preferably, the length of the second portion <b>56</b> is greater than the length of the first portion <b>54</b> and the intermediate portion <b>58</b> (see FIG. <b>4</b>). The keeper <b>18</b> is preferably configured such that the second portion <b>56</b> is oriented generally perpendicular to the first portion <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">The intermediate portion <b>58</b> is positioned between the interior edge <b>68</b> of the first portion <b>54</b> and the interior edge <b>82</b> of the second portion <b>56</b>. The intermediate portion <b>58</b> has an upper segment <b>84</b>. Unlike conventional devices, a rib <b>86</b> extends from the upper segment <b>84</b>. The rib <b>86</b> is an elongated structure that increases the structural integrity or strength of the keeper <b>18</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the rib <b>86</b> is positioned adjacent to the interior edge <b>68</b> of the first portion <b>54</b>. Described in a different manner, the rib <b>86</b> abuts an extent of the interior edge <b>68</b>. As shown in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the contact between the rib <b>86</b> and the first portion <b>54</b> defines an &#x201c;L-shaped&#x201d; structure. The rib <b>86</b> has a top segment <b>88</b> and bottom segment <b>90</b>. Preferably, the rib <b>86</b> is generally aligned with the intermediate segment <b>63</b> of the first portion <b>54</b>. This means that the top segment <b>88</b> is positioned substantially between the first aperture <b>60</b> and the second aperture <b>61</b>. Alternatively, the top segment <b>88</b> of the rib <b>86</b> is aligned with either the first aperture <b>60</b> or the top segment <b>62</b> of the first portion <b>54</b>. The bottom segment <b>90</b> of the rib <b>86</b> is substantially aligned with the second aperture <b>61</b>. Alternatively, the bottom segment <b>90</b> extends past the second aperture <b>61</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the rib <b>86</b> has a sloped or tapered configuration, meaning that the top and bottom segments <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> do not share the same geometry. However, the top and bottom segments <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> can be designed to have the same geometry thereby causing the rib <b>86</b> to have a linear configuration. Preferably, the length of the intermediate portion <b>58</b> is less than the length of the first portion <b>54</b> and the second portion <b>56</b> (see FIG. <b>4</b>). The keeper <b>18</b> is preferably configured such that the intermediate portion <b>58</b> is oriented generally perpendicular to the first portion <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">The slot <b>59</b> is generally positioned between the finger <b>72</b> of the second portion <b>56</b> and the rib <b>86</b> of the intermediate portion <b>58</b>. In other words, the configuration of the slot <b>59</b> is generally defined by the finger <b>72</b> and the rib <b>86</b>. The slot <b>59</b> is adapted to slidingly engage a portion of the pin <b>38</b> when the window assembly <b>16</b> is moved from the closed position to the open position, or from the open position to the closed position. Described in different terms, the slot <b>59</b> is adapted to receive a portion of the pin <b>38</b> when the window assembly <b>16</b> is moved from the closed position to the open position, or from the open position to the closed position. The slot <b>59</b> has a first interior surface <b>92</b> corresponding to, or defined by the finger <b>72</b>. The slot <b>59</b> also has a second interior surface <b>96</b> corresponding to, or defined by the rib <b>86</b>. Due to the presence of the rib <b>86</b>, the first interior surface <b>92</b> is generally opposed to the second interior surface <b>96</b>. Described in a different manner, the first interior surface <b>92</b> is generally opposed to the second interior surface <b>96</b>. An apex or top portion <b>94</b> of the slot <b>59</b> is defined by the combination of the rib <b>86</b>, the intermediate portion <b>58</b>, and the finger <b>56</b>. The apex portion <b>94</b> has an apex surface <b>95</b> (see FIG. <b>4</b>). The apex surface <b>95</b> is sloped or swaged to increase the strength of the keeper <b>18</b> through a variety of methods, including but not limited to work hardening. Although the apex portion <b>94</b> is shown as having a generally curvilinear configuration, it can have a generally linear configuration. The slot <b>59</b> has a &#x201c;U-shaped&#x201d; configuration, however, the precise configuration can vary with the design of the keeper <b>18</b> and the pin <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">It is understood that the intermediate portion <b>58</b> can be considered to be integral with or a part of the second portion <b>56</b>. As a result, the second portion <b>56</b> extends generally perpendicular from the interior edge <b>68</b> of the first portion <b>54</b> and wherein the rib <b>86</b> is adjacent the first portion <b>54</b>. In this manner, the slot <b>59</b> is positioned within the second portion <b>56</b> and the slot <b>59</b> is generally defined by the rib <b>86</b> and the finger <b>72</b> of the second portion <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the keeper <b>18</b> has a complex configuration. As shown therein, the first portion <b>54</b> defines the generally planar mounting surface <b>70</b>. The interior edge <b>68</b> has a generally rounded configuration. The intermediate portion <b>58</b> has a first region <b>58</b><i>a </i>and a second region <b>58</b><i>b</i>, wherein the first region <b>58</b><i>a </i>extends from the interior edge <b>68</b>. The second region <b>58</b><i>b </i>extends from the first region <b>58</b><i>a </i>such that the intermediate portion <b>58</b> has an angled configuration when viewed from an end of the keeper <b>18</b>. The interior edge <b>82</b> is positioned between the intermediate portion <b>58</b> and the second portion <b>56</b>. The second portion <b>56</b> has a first region <b>56</b><i>a </i>and a second region <b>56</b><i>b</i>, wherein the first region <b>56</b><i>a </i>extends from the interior edge <b>82</b>. The second region <b>56</b><i>b </i>extends from the first region <b>56</b><i>b </i>such that the second portion <b>56</b> has an angled configuration when viewed from an end of the keeper <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">Conventional keeper designs lack the rib <b>86</b> of the present invention. Although most conventional designs include a slot to receive a pin, the interior edge of the slot is omitted such that the slot makes direct contact with the first portion. As a result, the first portion defines the configuration of the slot&#x2014;namely an interior edge of the slot. In contrast, the rib <b>86</b> makes contact with an extent of the first portion <b>54</b> and defines the interior edge <b>96</b> of the slot <b>59</b>. Thus, the rib <b>86</b> dramatically alters the configuration of the keeper <b>18</b>. In addition, a multitude of conventional keepers feature a relief, meaning a portion of material from the first portion is removed from the keeper. The relief is intended to increase the strength of the conventional keeper. The keeper <b>18</b> of the present invention does not require this feature, since the rib <b>86</b> increases the strength of the keeper <b>18</b>. In addition, forming the relief increases the manufacturing costs of the conventional keeper.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">As explained above, the rib <b>86</b> is adapted to increase the structural integrity or strength of the keeper <b>18</b>. Applying industry-wide testing, this means the keeper <b>18</b> can be subjected to a greater amount of force than conventional devices before deforming and/or reaching a failure point. During testing, this force is typically applied to a region of the second portion <b>56</b> in a direction substantially perpendicular to the first portion <b>54</b> tending to force the second portion <b>56</b> away from the first portion <b>54</b>. The rib <b>86</b> increases the rigidity of the keeper <b>18</b> thereby increasing the overall strength of the keeper <b>18</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the keeper <b>18</b> of the present invention can withstand over 500 pounds of force loading before failure, whereas conventional keepers fail at approximately 250 pounds of force loading. As a result and compared to conventional designs, a lesser number of keepers <b>18</b> for a casement window assembly <b>10</b> are required to meet the industry standards used to evaluate the overall strength of the casement window assembly <b>10</b>. This increases the utility and value of the keeper <b>18</b> and reduces the overall hardware costs of the casement window assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">The keeper <b>18</b> can be fabricated from a variety of materials, including metal. For example in a preferred embodiment, the keeper <b>18</b> can be fabricated from <b>304</b> stainless steel. The remaining components of the casement window assembly <b>10</b>, such as the pin <b>38</b>, the lock bar <b>40</b>, and the link <b>50</b> can be formed from a number of materials. The length of the keeper <b>18</b> can vary between 1.0-4.0 inches depending upon the design parameters of the keeper <b>18</b> and the casement window assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">While the specific embodiments have been illustrated and described, numerous modifications come to mind without significantly departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of protection is only limited by the scope of the accompanying Claims.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">A weatherstrip for an automobile includes an attaching portion having an inverse U-shape cross section. A rising portion is formed in a protruding manner on the attaching portion and lip pieces are formed for sealing between a door inner panel and a window glass. The rising portion includes a sloping guide that leads to a concave groove with which the trim end of a trim is fitted and latched. To attach the weatherstrip to the upper edge of an inner panel of a door beltline, the attaching portion is attached to the flange by insertion. Then the trim end of the trim is pressed against the guide and is, thrust so as to be fitted and latched with the concave groove. Since the trim end need not climb over the flange while keeping a weatherstrip attached thereto, even if the angle created by the door beltline and a pillar is an acute angle, the creation of a large gap between the weatherstrip end and the pillar is eliminated.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e680" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention relates to a weatherstrip to be attached to a car door panel for sealing between the same and a window glass and, in particular, to a weatherstrip to be attached to the upper edge of a door inner panel of a door beltline.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">As this type of weatherstrip, there is a weatherstrip <b>21</b> which is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, attached to the trim <b>23</b> end portion as a door interior material joined to an inner panel <b>22</b>. In an automobile door having the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, joining of the trim <b>23</b> to the inner panel <b>22</b> is carried out in such a manner that the trim <b>23</b> is slightly lifted and thrust into the inner panel <b>22</b>, is then dragged down to latch the trim end with a flange <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the inner panel <b>22</b>, and for joining the trim <b>23</b> to the inner panel <b>22</b>, the trim end needs to climb over the flange.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">However, as with an automobile shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in a case where the angles of corner portions A and B created by a beltline BL, a front pillar <b>24</b>, and a rear pillar <b>25</b> are acute angles, as the position approximates the pillars <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>, in an attempt to climb over the flange <b>22</b><i>a </i>by lifting the trim <b>23</b>, the trim end comes to make contact against and interfere with the inclined pillar <b>24</b> or <b>25</b>. Especially in a case where, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the weatherstrip <b>21</b> is attached to the trim end in advance and the trim <b>23</b> is joined to the inner panel <b>22</b>, contact against the pillar <b>24</b> or <b>25</b> easily occurs for the thickness of the weatherstrip <b>21</b> on the trim end. Therefore, it is inevitable to attach the weatherstrip end apart from the pillar <b>24</b> or <b>25</b> and, consequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a gap c where the weatherstrip cannot be attached is created in the corner portions A and B. To deal with this gap, priorly, a method for filling up a gap c by fitting a separate component or a method for attaching a weatherstrip by forcibly pushing the same even if the weatherstrip end makes contact against the pillar <b>24</b> or <b>25</b> has been employed. However, in the former method for filling up a gap with a component, the number of components increases and the number of processes increases, resulting in high cost. Also, in the latter method, attachment cannot be easily carried out, the external appearance after attachment is not favorable, and damage to the weatherstrip and pillar garnish easily occurs.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">As another countermeasure, a method is known, wherein as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a weatherstrip <b>27</b> is attached to a flange <b>26</b><i>a </i>of an inner panel <b>26</b> in advance, a trim <b>28</b> is attached so as to fit over the weatherstrip <b>27</b>, and a rib <b>28</b><i>a </i>of a trim <b>28</b> is latched with a clip <b>29</b> to be attached to the flange <b>26</b><i>a </i>(Japanese Registered Utility Model No. 2587880). According to this method, the trim end is laterally inserted to fit over the flange <b>26</b><i>a </i>and therefore need not climb over the flange, the gap c as shown in the foregoing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can be reduced, however, in this case as well, the number of components increases, resulting in high cost.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e998" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">It is an object of the present invention to provide a weatherstrip for an automobile whereby the aforementioned gap can be reduced without increasing components and processes in number.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">A weatherstrip according to one aspect of the invention comprises an attaching portion to be attached to a flange on the upper end of an automobile door inner panel by attaching means. This attaching portion comprises sealing portions which are elastically fitted to a window glass to seal between the door inner panel and window glass and a latching portion which is, when a trim as an interior material is thrust into and joined to the door inner panel, latched with the trim end and restricts movement of the trim end.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">According to the present invention, after the weatherstrip is attached to a flange of a door inner panel, the trim as an interior material is joined by latching the trim end with the latching portion of the weatherstrip. And, at the time of joining, the trim end need not climb over the flange while keeping the weatherstrip attached therewith, therefore, even if a pillar at the end of the beltline is inclined and the angle created between the same and door beltline is an acute angle, the weatherstrip can be joined with a reduced gap between the weatherstrip end and pillar. In addition, the trim is joined by latching the trim end with the latching portion of the weatherstrip, therefore, a clip for latching the trim end as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9 and a</figref> connecting work with the clip can be made unnecessary, whereby it becomes possible to reduce cost.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">As attaching means for attaching the attaching portion provided in a weatherstrip of the present invention to a flange on the upper edge of an inner panel, for example, protruding pieces or lips which are provided in a protruding manner from opposite surfaces of an inserting groove to be inserted over the flange and grasp the flange can be mentioned, and moreover, a glue for adhering the attaching portion with the flange, a fixedly attaching member, such as a screw or a bolt, for connecting the attaching portion to the flange can be mentioned.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">The sealing portions usually have a lip shape but may have a hollow shape.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">Also, as the latching portion, for example, a claw or a step which is latched with the trim end from one side and a groove or the like with which the trim end is fitted can be mentioned.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">In a weatherstrip according to another aspect of the invention, the aforementioned latching portion of the weatherstrip is a concave groove facing upward, and the trim end which is formed to face downward is fitted therewith.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">According to the present invention, the trim end is restricted in terms of its movement and is positioned at an appointed position, whereby it becomes possible to attach the trim at a moderate position so as not to approach the window glass too close.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">In a weatherstrip according to still another aspect of the invention, a sloping or curved guide means leading to the latching portion is formed, and at the time of joining of the trim, the trim end which is formed to face downward reaches the latching portion by being guided by the guiding means and is latched with said latching portion.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">According to the present invention, it becomes possible that, when the trim is thrust into the inner panel, the trim end is guided by the guide means and is latched with the latching portion smoothly and securely.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">It is desirable that the aforementioned weatherstrip has a rack portion and the guide means is formed continuously from the rack portion. This is because if the trim end is placed on the rack portion and is thrust, the trim end is latched with the latching portion via the guide means and owing to provision of the rack portion, it becomes possible to smoothly carry out a shift of the trim end to the guide means.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">In a weatherstrip according to still another aspect of the invention, the attaching portion has an inserting groove to be inserted over a flange and thus forms an inverse U-shape in terms of its section and a protrusion which makes contact with a flange side and thereby prevents the attaching portion from inclining when being attached by insertion is formed in a protruding manner in the inserting groove or a thick-walled portion is formed.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">The above protrusion or thick-walled portion may be formed on one of the opposed surfaces which form the inserting groove or may be formed on both thereof. Moreover, formation thereof may be at one place or may be at a plurality of places.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">In a weatherstrip according to still another aspect of the invention, lip pieces for guiding the weatherstrip so that, when the attaching portion is inserted over the flange, the protrusion or thick-walled portion is prevented from being caught on a top portion of the flange are formed below the protrusion or thick walled portion.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">According to the present invention, the weatherstrip is, when inserted over the flange, guided by the lip pieces, whereby it becomes possible to insert the attaching portion over the flange without the protrusion being caught on the top portion of the flange.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">In a weatherstrip according to a further aspect of the invention, the aforementioned attaching portion has an inserting groove to be inserted over a flange and also has a claw portion to be latched with a hook-up portion formed on the flange.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">According to the present invention, by latching the claw portion with the hook-up portion, it becomes possible to carry out positioning when the attaching portion is inserted over the flange, and to prevent the weatherstrip from coming off the flange and prevent inclination.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e991" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention relates to a covering that is used to protect a prefabricated home as it is being transported.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">The prefabricated home industry is an important part of the construction industry. Prefabricated homes are more affordable and are more attractively priced for first-time home buyers. They are unique in the construction industry since the majority of the home is built off of the actual lot where the home is set.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Transportation of a prefabricated home is done in sections and requires the transported home to be protected from the elements as it arrives to its final destination. This and similar protection is also reflected in the related art.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">U.S. Pat. No. 1,871,571 issued to Weber, outlines the use of a waterproof covering sheet or tarpaulin. This tarpaulin can be used to cover and protect various objects on both land and sea. These tarpaulins are usually relatively large and are comparatively expensive due to the amount of canvas required for their construction.</p>

<p id="P-00027" num="00027">The present invention is a prefabricated home covering <b>10</b>, designed to protect a prefabricated home as it is being transported. The prefabricated home covering <b>10</b> comprises one generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> used to cover the middle section of the prefabricated home being transported. There are a plurality of rubber straps and D-rings provided with S-hooks <b>30</b> to hold the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> from the bottom of a transporting trailer. There are also two generally trapezoidal sheets of tarpaulin material <b>40</b> used to cover the ends of the prefabricated home being transported, which are also attached from the bottom of the trailer frame transporting the prefabricated home. There is a second plurality of rubber straps and D-rings provided with S-hooks <b>50</b> to hold the generally trapezoidal sheets of tarpaulin material <b>40</b> from the bottom of the transporting trailer.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">There are a plurality of grommets <b>60</b> on the top edge of the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> to accommodate a plurality of nails or screws (not shown) that will be nailed through the plurality of grommets <b>60</b>, that will hold the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> from the roof line of the prefabricated home.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">The prefabricated home covering <b>10</b> also has a plurality of strap buckle assemblies <b>70</b> alternatingly attaching the sides of the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> with the sides of generally trapezoidal sheets of tarpaulin material <b>40</b>, enclosing and protecting the sides of the prefabricated home while exposing the exterior siding of the prefabricated home across from the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b>. In other words, a generally trapezoidal sheet of tarpaulin material <b>40</b> will cover one of each of the end-sections of the prefabricated home and be attached with a strap buckle assembly <b>70</b> to the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> that will cover the middle section. The free end of the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> would then be attached to another generally trapezoidal sheet of tarpaulin material <b>40</b> that would be extended to cover the other end of the prefabricated home. The remaining generally trapezoidal sheet of tarpaulin material <b>40</b> would then cover the remaining end section of the prefabricated home and be attached to the free end of each of the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> with a strap buckle assembly <b>70</b>, completing the entire prefabricated home covering <b>10</b>. The prefabricated home covering <b>10</b> also has a plurality of rings <b>80</b> that are provided across the approximate middle of the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> to help secure the prefabricated home covering <b>10</b> while transporting the prefabricated home in windy conditions.</p>

The generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> has a strap buckle assembly <b>70</b> on each side that provides a plurality of individual buckles <b>72</b> that will correspond to mate with a plurality of straps (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) from each generally trapezoidal sheet of tarpaulin material <b>40</b>. As discussed earlier, rubber straps and D-rings with S-hooks <b>30</b> are used to secure the bottom of the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> to a trailer frame and nails or wood screws (not shown) that will be nailed through the plurality of grommets <b>60</b>, that will hold the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> from the roof line of the prefabricated home. A plurality of rings <b>80</b> can be used with a rope (not shown) to tie down the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> in windy conditions.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an isolated depiction of the generally trapezoidal sheet of tarpaulin material <b>40</b>. The top of the generally trapezoidal sheet of tarpaulin material <b>40</b> is provided with grommets <b>60</b> to accommodate a plurality of nails or screws that will be nailed through the plurality of grommets <b>60</b> to secure the top of the generally trapezoidal sheet of tarpaulin material <b>40</b>. An additional plurality of grommets <b>90</b> are provided on a vertical edge <b>92</b> opposite the strap buckle assembly <b>70</b> of the generally trapezoidal sheets of tarpaulin material <b>40</b>. This is to accommodate an additional plurality of nails or screws that will be nailed through the plurality of grommets <b>90</b>, that will hold the generally trapezoidal sheets of tarpaulin material <b>40</b> at the vertical edge <b>92</b> opposite the strap buckle assembly <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">The strap end <b>74</b> of the strap buckle assembly <b>70</b> is attached to the generally trapezoidal sheet of tarpaulin material <b>40</b> and is mated with buckles <b>72</b> from the strap buckle assembly <b>70</b> of the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b>. The tension on the strap buckle assembly <b>70</b> is manually adjustable with a tine and coordinated set of holes (not shown) and is well-known to those schooled in the related art. Like the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b>, the generally trapezoidal sheets of tarpaulin material <b>40</b> are also secured with an additional plurality of rubber straps and D-rings with S-shaped hooks <b>50</b> that grasp the frame of the trailer transporting a prefabricated home.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">The prefabricated home covering <b>10</b> has a generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> and two generally trapezoidal sheets of tarpaulin material <b>40</b> that are made of vinyl, and are intended to be durable enough for reusable usage. Adjustments with the rubber straps and D-rings with S-hooks <b>30</b>, <b>50</b> and the strap buckle assemblies <b>70</b> are done manually and nails and wood screws can be hammered through any provided grommets <b>60</b>, <b>90</b> to secure the generally rectangular sheet of tarpaulin material <b>20</b> and the two generally trapezoidal sheets of tarpaulin material <b>40</b> to the trailer carrying the prefabricated home.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1078" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">The present invention relates to a roof structure, and more particularly, to a roof structure having an integral rain gutter.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">It is generally known to provide for a roof support located along a central peak of pitched roofs for small storage and utility buildings or sheds having shallow-pitched roof panels. Such roof supports typically span the length of the roof and provide structural support at the joint between sloped roof panels which abut along the roof peak. The roof support may typically include a separate cover portion to cover the joint and reduce exposure of the joint and shed interior to snow, rain and other weather elements. Roof supports of this type are typically made from lightweight materials and assembled from multiple components manufactured by a thermoplastic molding or extrusion process.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">However, such molded and/or extruded thermoplastic roof support assemblies have several disadvantages including roof sagging and concomitant water leakage. Such sagging and leakage is typically due to the relatively low rigidity and the temperature and time dependent creep of the thermoplastic roof support material. These disadvantages have required manufacturers to attempt to develop roof supports that are more rigid, thereby preventing roof sagging and subsequent water leakage. For example, roof supports are now designed to include separate steel rods that are inserted within the extruded roof support to provide more rigidity to the roof support and limit deflection and creep of the roof supports.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Despite such improvements, roofs continue to sag and extruded roof supports continue to deflect, allowing water leakage at the joint. To overcome the water leakage problem, manufacturers began providing a rain gutter in combination with the roof support to capture and divert any water that penetrates the cover and joint along the roof peak to reduce leakage inside the building. Traditionally, rain gutters snap-on to the roof panels under the joint of the roof peak, and any water that creeps along the surface of the roof panels or enters the joint will be directed to the rain gutter for subsequent disposal. Although the addition of rain gutters help to prevent water leakage inside the building, it provides another piece of equipment to manufacture and does not alleviate the problems and disadvantages associated with roof sagging and roof support deflection. As a result, manufacturers have provided columns or other vertical supports within the building to bolster the roof support, resulting in the additional expense associated with several manufacturing processes and assembly operations.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">Accordingly, there exists a need for a roof support that provides more rigidity and which can also accommodate water leakage. Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a roof support with integral gutter. Another objective of the roof support with integral gutter of the present invention is to provide a roof support having higher strength and rigidity, which will limit roof support deflection and roof sag. A related objective of the roof support with integral gutter is that it should not require additional components, such as steel rods, to provide rigidity to the roof support.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">Another objective of the roof support with integral gutter of the present invention is to provide a roof support with a panel joint cover and a gutter that are unitarily formed with the roof support by a single manufacturing process, thereby eliminating the necessity to separately manufacture each individual part, and reducing manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Additionally, an objective of the roof support with an integral gutter is that it should be manufactured by a process that is easy to implement, is versatile, and produces a higher strength product to prevent roof sag that results in subsequent water leakage. Finally, it is an objective of the roof support with integral rain gutter that it provide all of the aforesaid objectives and advantages without incurring any substantial relative disadvantage.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1123" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">The present invention relates to a roof support with an integral gutter including a roof support, a panel joint cover, and a gutter for a small storage or utility building or shed having a shallow-pitched roof. In particular, the roof support with integral gutter includes a support web, an exposure surface perpendicularly bisecting the support web, and a collector perpendicularly bisecting the support web opposite the exposure surface.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">The exposure surface acts as the panel joint cover and is designed to fit over abutting roof panels to protect a joint formed therebetween from environmental conditions. The exposure surface also acts as the first barrier to water leakage inside the building. The exposure surface may have a negative angle with respect to the support web to correspond to the angle of the abutting roof panels to provide a seal between the roof panels and roof support, and to maintain continuity between the roof panels and the roof support.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">The collector includes a distal edge angled from the plane of the lower portion of the collector to provide a channel between the distal edge and the support web, forming the integral gutter. The distal edge of the collector is angled away from the lower surface between about 90&#xb0; and 175&#xb0;, with a length great enough to provide the collector with a depth sufficient to direct a substantial volume of liquid along the collector. With the collector, any water or other moisture which penetrates the joint and the exposure surface will seep into the collector and be directed to a drain or away from the building.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">The roof support with integral gutter may be used in combination with at least one roof panel having an exterior surface and an interior surface opposite the exterior surface. When two roof panels are used, the roof structure divides and supports each roof panel. Each roof panel abuts the support web, with a portion of the roof panel fitting between the exposure surface and the collector of the roof support. This permits the exposure surface to extend over the exterior surfaces of the roof panels and cover the joint formed between the roof panels. The roof panels are supported by the distal edges of the collector, which are closely adjacent to the interior surfaces of the roof panels. Each roof panel may also include a drip edge that extends longitudinally along the interior surface parallel to the support web of the roof support and intermediate the distal edge and the support web over the collector. The drip edge acts to disrupt the cohesive bond between the moisture and the roof panel surface so that the moisture drips from the interior surface at this point. The collector extends beyond the drip edge to capture any moisture that falls from the roof panel when the roof panel is situated intermediate the exposure surface and the collector.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">In part, the present invention is a method of making a roof support. The method includes introducing fibers to a resin bath to form a fiber-resin combination, contouring the fiber-resin combination in the shape of a roof support and curing the resin-fiber combination. The roof support may be contoured to include a support web, an exposure surface and a collector. The roof support may then be cut to desired specifications.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">This invention overcomes the problems and disadvantages associated with the related art by providing a roof support with integral gutter. The roof support with integral gutter has increased strength and rigidity to limit roof support deflection and roof sag. Further, the roof support with integral gutter of the present invention does not require additional components, such as steel rods, to provide the strength and rigidity to the roof support.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">The roof support with integral gutter also provides a roof support with a panel joint cover and a gutter integrally formed with the roof support. This is accomplished by a single manufacturing process, and reduces parts inventory and manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">Also, the roof support with integral gutter of the present invention is manufactured by a process that is easy, versatile, and produces a high strength product. This results in a roof support that prevents roof sag and water seepage through and/or near the joint between roof panels. As is shown and described, the roof support with integral gutter of the present invention has one or more of these or other advantageous features, and achieves all of the aforesaid advantages and objectives without incurring any substantial relative disadvantage.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">The above brief description sets forth rather broadly the more important features of the present invention so that the detailed description that follows may be better understood, and so that the present contributions to the art may be better appreciated.

<heading id="heading-d0e1243" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a small storage or utility building <b>10</b> having a shallow-pitched roof <b>12</b> is shown according to the preferred embodiment. An example of a building and roof of this type are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/086,061 titled &#x201c;Modular Panel Construction System,&#x201d; filed on May 27, 1998, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The shallow pitched-roof <b>12</b> includes roof panels <b>14</b> that are supported along a central peak line <b>15</b> of shallow-pitched roof <b>12</b> by roof support <b>20</b> (not shown in this view).</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> displays the shallow-pitched roof <b>12</b> more clearly. The shallow-pitched roof <b>12</b> includes two roof panels <b>14</b> separated by a centrally positioned roof support <b>20</b> that divides the roof <b>12</b>. The roof support <b>20</b> spans the length of building <b>10</b> and is supported on either end by the end wall structure <b>18</b> of building <b>10</b> (shown in FIG. <b>1</b>). Although a roof having two roof panels is shown and described, it would be apparent to one skilled in the art to construct a roof using a single roof panel.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> more clearly displays the roof panel <b>14</b> and roof support <b>20</b> relationship. Roof panels <b>14</b> are positioned in a continuously abutting relationship along both lateral sides of a support web portion <b>22</b> of roof support <b>20</b>. Roof panels <b>14</b> have an exterior surface <b>17</b> and an interior surface <b>19</b>. Roof panels <b>14</b> are configured with a longitudinal drip edge <b>16</b> (e.g. slot, groove, indent, lip, etc.) that extends along the interior surface <b>19</b> of the roof panel <b>14</b> parallel to the longitudinal axis of the roof support <b>20</b>. Drip edge <b>16</b> provides a discontinuity in the interior panel surface that allows any leaking moisture adhering to roof panel <b>14</b> to drip off the panel into the roof support <b>20</b> and prevents moisture from migrating laterally beyond the roof support <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Roof support <b>20</b> includes an exposure surface <b>24</b> (e.g., panel joint cover, flaps, shields, protector, etc.) extending along the entire length of roof support <b>20</b>. Exposure surface <b>24</b> projects laterally outward from an upper end of support web <b>22</b> and is intended to overlap roof panels <b>14</b> on both lateral sides of support web <b>22</b> to shield the joint created between the abutting roof panels <b>14</b> and support web <b>22</b> from rain and other elements of the weather.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">Roof support <b>20</b> also includes a collector <b>50</b> (e.g., tray, channel, pan, trough, etc.) extending along the entire length of roof support <b>20</b>. Collector <b>50</b> projects laterally outward from a lower end of support web <b>22</b> and extends beneath a portion of each roof panel <b>14</b>, slightly beyond the drip edges <b>16</b>. Collector <b>50</b> is configured to capture water that penetrates the joint created between the abutting roof panels <b>14</b> and support web <b>22</b> and divert the water to a drain (not shown) or away from the interior of the building.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, roof support <b>20</b> is shown according to a preferred embodiment. Roof support <b>20</b> is desirably formed using a thermoset pultrusion process where reinforcing filaments are passed from a fiber delivery system (e.g., reels, spindles, etc.) and pulled through a resin impregnation bath. The resin-embedded fibers are then pulled through preform fixtures (e.g., one or more dies), which contour and align the fiber-resin combination into the roof support shape that will be subsequently described. The contoured fiber-resin combination then passes through a heated fixture or die (not shown) to cure (i.e., &#x201c;cross-link&#x201d;) the resin. Upon curing, roof support <b>20</b> is extracted from the heated die and cut into the lengths that correspond to use in buildings <b>10</b> or other structures. Although pultrusion is preferred, other types of methods may be used to form the roof support including extrusion, rollform, weldment, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">According to a particularly preferred embodiment, roof support <b>20</b> has a length of approximately 64 in, and all subsequently described dimensions correspond to a length of approximately 64 in; however the length can be modified to suit a wide variety of building sizes and the subsequently described dimensions may be adjusted accordingly to maintain acceptable deflection levels under a particular set of loading conditions. In a preferred embodiment, the fiber filaments and resin combination have a modulus of elasticity (E) of at least about 2,500,000 pounds per square in (PSI). In the particularly preferred embodiment, the fiber filaments are glass fibers and the resin is a thermoset polyester resin, the combination having a modulus of elasticity (E) of approximately 2,700,000 to 3,300,000 PSI. However, other fibers and resins known in the art may be used, including graphite, polyethylene, vinyl esters, epoxy resins and combinations thereof. The fiber-resin combination may also be cured by other methods known by those skilled in the art, including chemical curing. In further alternative embodiments, roof support <b>20</b> may be fabricated with an extrusion process from thermoplastic materials or composites thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, roof support <b>20</b> is formed with a uniform cross-section along its entire length that is symmetrical and generally &#x201c;I-beam&#x201d; shaped, and includes a centrally located vertical support web <b>22</b>. Integrally formed with the support web <b>22</b> is the exposure surface <b>24</b>, which generally perpendicularly bisects the support web <b>22</b>. Support web <b>22</b> is also integral with the collector <b>50</b>, which also generally perpendicularly bisects the support web <b>22</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the roof support <b>20</b> has a moment of inertia of between about 2.9 in<sup>4 </sup>and 3.3 in<sup>4</sup>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the roof support <b>20</b> has a moment of inertia of approximately 3.180 in<sup>4</sup>, and the support web <b>22</b> has a thickness of approximately 0.080 in and a height of approximately 4.222 in. However, the roof support may have a wide range of moment of inertia, and the support web a wide range of thickness and height to meet desired specifications. Further, the support web may be shaped differently when used in combination with a single roof panel to support the roof panel and prevent roof sag.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">The exposure surface <b>24</b> has flanges <b>30</b> (e.g., arms, flaps, etc.) projecting outward in opposing lateral directions from an upper end of support web <b>22</b>, the underside of flanges <b>30</b> having rounded fillets <b>40</b> at the juncture with support web <b>22</b>, although squared fillets would be suitable as well. The outwardly projecting flanges <b>30</b> have a shallow negative slope corresponding to the pitch of roof panels <b>14</b> to improve the sealing performance of the exposure surface <b>24</b> against roof panels <b>14</b>. The shallow negative slope may be any angle from and including horizontal, which is suitable for providing a tight fit with the pitch of roof panels <b>14</b>. Flanges <b>30</b> may be formed along their length with arcuate projections <b>36</b> (e.g., ridges, channels, tracks, etc.) extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of roof support <b>20</b> and configured to interface with any corresponding projections <b>42</b> on the upper surface of roof panels <b>14</b> for improved position retention and sealing performance of roof support <b>20</b> (shown most clearly in FIG. <b>3</b>). In a particularly preferred embodiment, exposure surface <b>24</b> has an overall width of approximately 3.750 in and a thickness of approximately 0.080 in, although this may vary depending on desired specifications. Further, exposure surface <b>24</b> of roof support <b>20</b> and the exterior surface <b>17</b> of roof panels <b>14</b> have a relative clearance of approximately 0.015 in. Again, the relative clearance between the exposure surface <b>24</b> and the exterior surface <b>17</b> may vary widely to account for desired specifications.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, collector <b>50</b> is shown according to the preferred embodiment. Collector <b>50</b> has flanges <b>52</b> (e.g., legs, channels, troughs, etc.) projecting horizontally outward in opposing lateral directions from a lower end of support web <b>22</b> with each flange <b>52</b> having a distal end. The top side of flanges <b>52</b> have rounded fillets <b>40</b> at the juncture with support web <b>22</b>, but the fillets <b>40</b> may also be squared. Flanges <b>52</b> are formed along the length of their distal ends with an angularly upward projecting lip <b>56</b> extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of roof support <b>20</b> and configured to interface with a interior surface <b>19</b> of roof panels <b>14</b>. The angular portion of lip <b>56</b> has an angle from the top surface of flange <b>52</b> of about 90&#xb0; to 175&#xb0;, and more preferably about 125&#xb0; to 145&#xb0;. The angular portion of lip <b>56</b> may include a smooth transition to a horizontal portion <b>58</b> and then to a partial return bend end portion <b>60</b>. Horizontal portion <b>58</b> is configured to project slightly beyond drip edge <b>16</b> of roof panels <b>14</b> to support roof panels <b>14</b> and ensure that all moisture that drips from drip edge <b>16</b> is captured in collector <b>50</b>. The depth of collector <b>50</b> is determined by the vertical distance between the top surfaces of flanges <b>52</b> and horizontal portions <b>58</b> of distal ends, and the depth is greater than the maximum expected deflection of roof support <b>20</b> under the intended loading conditions to ensure that collected moisture flows to the ends of roof support <b>20</b>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, collector <b>50</b> has an overall width of approximately 3.500 in and a thickness of approximately 0.080 in, and the transition to horizontal portion <b>58</b> occurs at a distance of approximately 1.360 in from the centerline of support web <b>22</b>, with horizontal portion <b>58</b> raised above the top side of flanges <b>52</b> to provide a collector depth of approximately 0.335 in. In alternative embodiments, the overall width of collector <b>50</b> may be increased or decreased any desired amount provided that horizontal portion <b>58</b> extends beyond drip edge <b>16</b>, and the thickness of collector <b>50</b> may be any dimension suitable for providing a support and collector function.</p>

The outwardly projecting flanges <b>130</b> have a shallow negative slope corresponding to the pitch of roof panels <b>14</b>. The shallow negative slope may have any angle from and including to horizontal provide a tight fit with the pitch of roof panels <b>14</b>. Flanges <b>130</b> may be formed along their length with arcuate projections <b>136</b> extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of roof support <b>120</b> and configured to interface with corresponding projections <b>42</b> on the exterior surface <b>17</b> of roof panels <b>14</b>. The exposure surface <b>124</b> has an overall width of approximately 3.750 in and a thickness of approximately 0.075 in, which may be either increased or decreased depending on requirements.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1053" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">The present invention is directed to the art of pest control, and more particularly to the art of barriers for impeding route of travel of crawling arthropods at point source, point of entry. It serves as a novel technology in integrated pest management (IPM). The invention is particularly applicable to barriers for interrupting a route of travel of crawling arthropods along passageways that lead to partially enclosed or partially exposed spaces, and may be advantageously employed in these and other environments.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Ants and other crawling arthropods pose a problem to electrical or lighting wall work boxes, pipe flanges, fluid dispensing and intake passageways, enclosed utility boxes, heating, ventilating and air conditioning ports, and other enclosed or partially enclosed vias accessible to the pests. They are also undesirable in living areas, and are known to crawl up support structures to reach beds, table tops, racks and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">In agricultural areas where irrigation is used, ants tend to make their way into the tiny microjets that extend from the water feed line. The ants bring sand, dirt, food and other substances with them as they enter the jets. They also leave fecal matter. The fine microjets become clogged, and the flow of water therefrom becomes interrupted such that irrigation is interrupted. The jets must then be cleaned out or replaced on a frequent basis.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">In another example, crawling insects that are inside walls or utility passageways often invade interior spaces, such as residential living areas or commercial rooms, by entering through utility wall plates. This is particularly the case in warmer climates or nesting areas in all climates. It is not uncommon for ants to enter into a room via the openings for receptacles and switching outlet components or electrical sockets. Also, if there is a gap between the wall and wall plate, the ants can foreseeably crawl through the gap into the room. They can also crawl into a room through openings defined by plates for cable wires, light switches, blank plates, and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">Pipe flanges and other articles that cover openings in walls provide another area where arthropods find access into a room or into a wall. The arthropods or ants crawl behind the flanges or plates, through pipe cracks or through pipe openings covered by flanges, or gaps between the wall and plumbing pipes.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">Arthropods pose a serious problem for the microjets and other passageways, vias or enclosed or partially enclosed spaces attractive to such crawling insects. They clog passageways and spread diseases. They are considered a health hazard. Certain insects, such as red fire ants and Argentine ants, tend to sting humans, some to such a great extent to cause grave injury or even death. It is desirable to find a solution or an answer to these critical needs and to develop a way to prevent the arthropods from entering and clogging microjets and other vias. It is further desirable to develop a procedure for eliminating or dramatically reducing the passageway of the crawling arthropods into residential as well as non-residential spaces. Finally, it is desirable to develop an implement and method to obstruct a route of travel of crawling arthropods along an exposed, enclosed, or partially enclosed passageway.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">The present invention provides for a novel barrier implement and method for obstructing a route of travel of crawling arthropods that is safe, economical, and durable and provides a solution to the critical needs in integrated pest management.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1093" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a barrier for separating ants and other crawling arthropods and vermin from a point or area where they are undesired. A method for impeding a route of travel of crawling arthropods is also provided.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">A barrier implement intended for obstructing a route of travel of crawling arthropods along a passageway comprises a sheet material adapted to circumscribe the passageway along which arthropods crawl. A dimension of the sheet is sized relative to the passageway. An arthropod deterring component is associated with the sheet material to deter crawling arthropods and impede their route of travel along the passageway.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">A method of impeding a route of travel of crawling arthropods from a location A to a location B along a passageway is also provided. A sheet is positioned between the two locations. An arthropod deterring component is associated with the sheet. The sheet circumscribes the passageway, and a dimension of the sheet is sized relative to said passageway. An arthropod impervious barrier is created between location A and location B to impede a route of travel of crawling arthropods from moving from location A to location B is impeded.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">A principal advantage of the present invention is that the barrier implement can be retrofit to existing standard equipment. It provides an economical solution to a widespread insect problem.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">Another advantage of the present invention is that it falls within the recent mandate to reduce the broadcasting of pesticide chemicals.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Another advantage of the present invention is that the barrier device serves a dual purpose. It deters a route of travel of crawling arthropods. It also reduces or eliminates the infiltration of air or drafts that flows through electrical boxes, wall plates, pipe flanges and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">Yet another advantage of the invention is found in its duration. The implement can be applied and kept in place for up to several years. After the barrier implement loses its effectiveness, a new barrier implement can be readily installed to replace the old.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">Still other advantages and benefits of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading and understanding of the following detailed description.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1221" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">Referring now to the drawings where the showings are made for the purpose of illustration only and are not for the purpose of limiting same, the Figures set forth examples of environments in which a barrier implement for impeding a route of travel of crawling arthropods is useful. The implement is useful in connection with blocking progression of arthropods crawling along passageways, whether the passageways be elongated or abbreviated in length, enclosed or exposed. The implement is designed to surround or circumscribe a given passageway such that it obstructs the crawling arthropod from proceeding between a location A and a location B along said passageway. These two locations generally comprise areas on either side of an installed barrier implement.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">The barrier implement is comprised of any impregnable material or any material to which an arthropod deterring constituent could be superficially applied or impregnated. In a preferred embodiment, the sheet is comprised of a pliable polymer material into which an arthropod deterring component can be molded. But the material need not necessarily be pliable. The barrier implement can also be composed of a stiff or rigid material. The implement can be molded to be a circular, rectangular or any other shape disk, or it can be molded to virtually any configuration to fit or conform and adapt to any virtually surface orientation. For example, the disk can be shaped as a circle, square, angular, rectangular, as a wafer, a flap, gasket, washer, sheet, plate, shelf, leaf, thimble, coat, grommet, foil, membrane or virtually any configuration. It can be flat, concave, convex or embossed. It can be molded or extruded to fit any surface or embodiment to cause interruption of arthropod travel from point to point. Its purpose is to interrupt a route of crawling arthropod travel. It employs point source technology in that it stops or deters crawling arthropods at the source of the problem. It also responds to critical needs in integrated pest management.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">An active ingredient in the nature of an arthropod deterring component is associated with the barrier material. The component can be molded directly in the barrier material, or it can be applied to the surface by painting it on or by inserting or installing a cartridge thereon. Preferably, the component is a pesticide such as permetherin which can be molded directly in the sheet. Another pesticide or other type of arthropod deterring constituent, which may or may not comprise a pesticide, is contained in, applied to or molded directly in the barrier material composition. In some instances, a slippery substance, such as polytetraflurorethylene (Teflon) coating or petroleum jelly applied to the barrier material, will suffice to deter the crawling arthropods from proceeding along the passageway. The barrier serves the purpose of acting as a shield or barrier to prevent the ingress of arthropods into ports or enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces where pests are not desired, or even past certain points on flat or elongated structures.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">An example of an environment where the barrier implement is useful is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. Here, the barrier implement provides a deterring effect along an elongated passageway, in this particular case an external surface of a microjet capillary. An irrigation water line <b>10</b> travels along the ground <b>14</b>. The water line is shown broken away to indicate that it extends linearly in both directions. A thin diameter microjet capillary or flex tube <b>18</b> branches off the water line and is supported in a generally upward position by a stake <b>22</b> that is stationed in the ground. An upper end <b>24</b> of the stake is designed to hold or support the flex tube <b>18</b> in place. A microjet assembly <b>26</b> is in place at the distal end of the capillary or flex tube <b>18</b>. Water flows from water line <b>10</b> through capillary <b>18</b> and out through an opening <b>28</b> defined in a head portion <b>30</b> of the assembly. It is to be understood that the microjet assembly exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> includes a threaded tube which extends downward from the head, through hex nut <b>32</b>. The threaded tube is received within an internally threaded end <b>34</b> of capillary <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">The removable nature of the microjet assembly enables the installation of a barrier implement <b>36</b>. The barrier itself comprises a disk shaped sheet that is fashioned to enable an elongated or other type object pass therethrough. Here, the sheet is provided in a circular configuration, though virtually any configuration will suffice. The thickness of the sheet should be such that it can be accommodated in the environment. The sheet disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> is less than approximately {fraction (1/16)}&#x2033; in thickness, but this is not intended to be a limiting dimension. The sheet thickness is preferably substantially even, but is not required to be even.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">An opening <b>40</b> defined in the sheet is adapted to circumscribe an elongated or other structure therethrough. Here, the opening is sized to accommodate the capillary tube <b>18</b>. The barrier disk is held in place on the tube by passing threads from the microjet assembly through it and securing it in place by joining the assembly to the capillary and holding it in palace by the pressure of the hex nut.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">An arthropod deterring component is associated with the disk. The disk and arthropod deterring component together act as a barrier and a deterrent to prevent the crawling arthropods from passing through to the tiny microjet openings. As the arthropods crawl upward along the support member or the tube, they approach the disk. The arthropod deterring component associated with the disk deters them from continuing along their path.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows A detailed view of the microjet assembly. Ants or other arthropods are known to crawl into the microjet opening <b>28</b> when the jets are not in use. Microjets are typically used minimally, often only once per day, in order to conserve water. When the jets are not in use, the ants crawl in through the opening to seek out moisture, particularly in dry and arid situations. They bring sand, dirt, and food with them. This clogs the microjets, which then significantly disrupts the irrigation flow.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">Ants and other crawling arthropods are prevented or deterred from entering the microjets by placing a disk <b>36</b> that embodies an arthropod deterring agent around the threads of the microjet, just below the opening <b>28</b>. The disk extends to overhang the width of the capillary and is shown to rest on the top <b>24</b> of the stake <b>22</b>. Ants that would have to crawl up the stake or flex tube to reach the microjet opening or port <b>28</b> are deterred by the arthropod deterring agent embodied in the disk. They must encounter the disk before they can proceed to the opening.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">Another example of an environment in which the vermin deterring component can be used is shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. It is understood that the utility wall plate environment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a wall plate <b>42</b>, electrical socket <b>44</b>, socket box <b>46</b> and barrier implement <b>48</b>. As is traditional, the socket box is mounted inside a wall and is situated to hold an electrical socket in place therein. It is understood that the outlets <b>49</b> are exposed outside the wall via openings <b>50</b> within the wall plate. Barrier sheet <b>48</b> is configured to fit within an underside of the wall plate. When installed, it is sandwiched, at least about or near its periphery, between the wall plate and a wall. The barrier sheet is configured to define openings <b>52</b> therein for receiving or exposing electrical sockets therethrough. The sockets are exposed through the barrier implement and the wall plate <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">Barrier implement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also acts as an insulator while it keeps arthropod infestation down. As will be noted, sheet <b>48</b> is designed to fit inside a utility wall plate <b>42</b> to obstruct a route of travel of crawling arthropods. In many climates, there is a problem in that crawling arthropods tend to invade a room by entering through an opening made by a utility wall plate <b>42</b>. The sheet defines openings <b>52</b> that correspond to openings <b>50</b> in the wall plate <b>42</b> which are adapted to receive an electrical socket therethrough.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">Arthropods can also escape into a room through any gaps that are formed between a wall plate and a wall. The barrier implement is designed to prevent the escape of ants or other arthropods through such gaps.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">The sheet itself is configured to correspond to the size and shape of the wall plate. Generally, two opposing sides of the wall plate sheet are substantially equal in size. The sheet can be configured to agree to the shape and purpose of the wall plate. For example, the wall plate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is designed to cover a double electrical outlet. If there were two additional outlets under the plate, then the sheet would be designed to include those added outlets by including two additional holes.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">A similar situation is identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> where a light switch <b>54</b> is shown. It is understood that this environment includes a switchplate <b>55</b>, the switch <b>54</b>, socket box <b>56</b> and barrier implement <b>58</b>. The socket box <b>56</b> is recessed inside a wall and is adapted to hold the switch therein. It is understood that the toggle switch <b>57</b> is exposed outside the wall via opening <b>53</b> in the switchplate. The barrier implement <b>58</b> is configured to fit within an underside of the switchplate and, during installation, is at least sandwiched between the switchplate and the wall. A periphery of the barrier <b>58</b> and portions inward therefrom is mounted flush to a wall. Opening <b>59</b> is defined in the switchplate barrier <b>58</b> to receive or expose the toggle switch <b>57</b> therethrough.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">The barrier implement can be configured to virtually any shape or size. Another example of a useful barrier is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4. A</figref> barrier implement <b>60</b> is adapted to fit between a flange <b>62</b> and wall <b>64</b>. By way of example, a pipe <b>66</b> is shown as extending outward from said wall. Crawling arthropods that seek to enter a room by any gaps left by an installed pipe or conduit or the like are impeded by placement of the ring-shaped disk <b>60</b> behind the flange <b>62</b>. Gaps are often left between an opening in a wall <b>68</b> and a pipe or conduit. The disk is a sheet of material impregnated with an arthropod deterring component to interrupt a route of travel of the crawling arthropods from within a wall or behind a wall into a room.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">Barrier implements can be configured to correspond to other types of flanges including those from conduit, cable, dryer units and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">The barrier of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> serves an added benefit in that it reduces or eliminates drafts or air flow through openings in walls which are not adequately, insulated by pipes or flanges. After a time, the barrier implement can be recharged with a deterring component, or it can be easily discarded and replaced.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">Another useful environment for the barrier implement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. Here, a leg <b>70</b> supported by a caster <b>72</b> is shown. A coaster disk <b>74</b> defines an opening <b>75</b> for receipt of the leg therethrough. The leg can be for furniture or movable storage racks and all units supported by casters, where crawling insects are a problem. These include racks used in health care, food storage, laboratories or any other rolling structure supported by casters. Caster joining components <b>76</b> are received through opening <b>75</b> to position the coaster in place. The coaster acts as a receptacle for a barrier implement <b>78</b> which is clinglingly or otherwise mounted into the coaster. The barrier implement defines an opening that matches the coaster opening <b>75</b>. The coaster provides a shielding function for the barrier so that when it is in place the barrier is not in plain view of persons and is not easily touched by persons. It is foreseeable that the barrier device could be installed on a leg without the need for a coaster. The coaster provides one example of a shield for a barrier device. In this instance, the shield includes a barrier wall <b>80</b> with a rim <b>84</b>. It is to be understood that the rim could be angled outwardly or flared, as shown, or perpendicular to the barrier wall <b>80</b>. It is further understood that a return can be present at a bottom of the rim to minimize a gap between the caster and the coaster. The shield is composed of an inert material. The barrier shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> serves to prevent arthropods from crawling along a passageway formed from furniture legs and casters.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">This invention is not limited to the sheets disk shown in the Figures. Nor is it limited to the microjet, the wall plates, the flanges, or the furniture/caster environments shown in the figures. The situation shown in the figures is merely by way of example. The device of the present invention is fully adaptable to virtually any enclosed or partially enclosed area where it is desirable to eliminate ants, roaches and other crawling arthropods by stopping their route of travel from point to point. Examples of where the barrier device of the present invention can be used include irrigation systems, electrical systems, heating and air conditioning systems, agricultural equipment, table or cart on legs, adjacent casters (indoors or outdoors), or any other situation where crawling pests pose a problem. The list is non-inclusive and is intended to include adaptability of the device to virtually any environment in any configuration to aid in the stopping of travel of arthropods from point to point.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">The barrier can likewise be used with virtually any fluid dispensing or intake apparatus, any conduit, any enclosed or semi enclosed area where arthropods are not desired. Examples include, but are not limited to, use in utility boxes, junction boxes, at the end of hoses, electrical conduits inside tubes, outside tubes, at HVAC ports, or virtually anywhere that arthropods may crawl. The barrier device can be of virtually any configuration, and is molded to conform to the shape of the object to which it will be attached. It acts as a barrier, an exclusion device, a destruction device, blockade, impediment, or partition. It stops, kills or inhibits the route of travel from point to point of crawling arthropods. The device shields an enclosed or partially enclosed space from the crawling vermin. The vermin are prevented from crawling along the passageway from location A, which is defined as their source or the portion of passageway that leads from the source, to location B, which is defined as the area where arthropods are undesired or a portion of passageway which leads to that area.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">The barrier is readily removable and can be replaced with another if the arthropod deterring constituent or active ingredient should become ineffective or depleted. In the alternative, it can have a protective cover or shield to protect against dermal contact.</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">The invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment. Obviously modifications and alterations will occur to others upon a reading and understanding of this specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalent thereof.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e490" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">This invention relates to a brace utilized to restrict relative movement between a rod, such as a hanger rod, and building structure. The invention is suitable for example to brace a hanger rod during a seismic disturbance.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e500" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">My U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,317, issued Feb. 23, 1993, relates to a lateral brace for a hanger suspended from a rod to support pipes, electrical cables or the like, the lateral brace having two completely separable, slotted interlocking pieces which interlock to form a hole surrounding the rod and attach it to building structure without removing the hanger from the rod.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,247,274, issued Jun. 19, 2001, discloses a seismic brace having a brace arm for fastening to a support rod on one end and a structural portion of a building on the other end. The brace is attachable to the support rod without disconnecting it by a base bracket hinged to the brace arm and a locking bracket hinged to the base arm or the base bracket to overlay the base bracket.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">U.S. Pat. No. 6,421,965, dated Jul. 23, 2002, also relates to a seismic brace for fastening to a support rod at one end and a structural portion of a building at the other end. The brace is attachable to the support rod without disconnecting it. The brace arm portion of the seismic brace is bent at an angle of 45 degrees to form a base bracket that connects to the support rod. A locking bracket is hinged to the brace arm to overlay the brace bracket. Both the base bracket and locking bracket have a slot extending from an edge toward the middle, the slots being arranged so that they form an aperture when the locking bracket is moved about the hinge and overlays the base bracket part of the brace arm to completely enclose the support rod.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,415,560, issued Jul. 9, 2002, discloses a connector for connecting a seismic brace to a support rod, such as for a cable tray, to inhibit movement of the rod during seismic activity. The connector comprises a metal connecting member having an upper portion and a lower portion joined at a juncture. Openings in the juncture, upper portion and lower portion define a slot for entry of the support rod into the slot. The connector further comprises a retainer inserted in a gap between the upper and lower portions. The retainer bridges the slot to retain the support rod in the slot.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e525" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">The present invention relates to a bracket which is utilized to retain a rod, such as a hanger rod, at a location spaced from building structure and for restricting relative movement between the rod and the building structure. The brace is suitably employed, for example, to brace the rod relative to the structure in the event of a seismic disturbance.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The brace of the present invention differs from the above-referenced prior art arrangements in a number of respects. The brace disclosed herein is characterized by its relatively low cost and efficiency of operation as compared to prior art approaches. The brace is easy to install and once installed is much stronger than devices of equivalent size incorporating hinges, such as those illustrated in the above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 6,247,274, and 6,421,965. That is, the brace of the present invention can be made of much less bulky material and be of a size considerably smaller than the devices of the prior art noted in the preceding sentence to perform the equivalent bracing function.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">For example, the use of thin metal sheet material can be employed to advantage with respect to the invention disclosed and claimed herein. The relative simplicity of the structure of the brace of this invention allows it to be fabricated in very simple fashion. Fabrication of the brace is accomplished readily and simply, as compared to brackets or braces utilizing hinged elements.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">The brace of the present invention may be stacked with a brace of like construction to provide additional rod retention strength.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">The brace of the present invention is attachable by a connector to a building structure for retaining a rod at a location spaced from the building structure and for restricting relative movement between the rod and the building structure.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">The brace is of unitary construction and includes a double-sided first brace member having a first outer peripheral surface disposed between the sides thereof and defining a first closed ended, inwardly extending slot.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">The brace also includes a double-sided second brace member having a second outer peripheral surface disposed between the sides thereof and defining a second closed ended, inwardly extending slot.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">The first brace member and the second brace member are in overlapping condition and the first and second slots are offset from one another and in communication to form a rod receiving opening. The first brace member and the second brace member are cooperable to surround the rod receiving opening. At least one of the first and second brace members defines a connector receiving opening spaced from the rod receiving opening.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">A substantially rigid attachment element is affixed to both the first brace member and the second brace member at a location spaced from the rod receiving opening resisting relative movement between the first and second brace members and maintaining the first and second brace members in the overlapping condition.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Other features, advantages and objects of the present invention will become apparent with reference to the following description and accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="P-00031" num="00031">The brace member connector portions <b>38</b> define connector receiving openings <b>40</b> which are somewhat elongated in the embodiment illustrated and are in alignment and in communication with one another when the brace is in the condition shown in FIG. <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">A substantially rigid attachment element is affixed to both brace members at a location spaced from the rod receiving opening <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">The attachment element is in the form of a double-sided strip <b>44</b> integral with the brace members <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. The strip extends between the outer peripheral surfaces of the brace members and is bent so that it doubles over upon itself. In the arrangements illustrated, the strip has a width narrower than the widths of both the brace member <b>12</b> and the brace member <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">The doubled over strip projects outwardly from the outer peripheral surfaces of the brace members <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. An important feature or aspect of the present invention is the fact that the strip, once bent over, is a work hardened, rigid member formed under applied force. Once pressure formed to a desired shape, the projecting doubled over strip maintains its shape, serving to maintain the brace members <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in face-to-face relationship (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> for example) and not functioning as a hinge.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a one-piece blank from which the brace <b>10</b> is formed. The blank suitably may be stamped out from a sheet of steel or other suitable sheet material.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">The strip <b>44</b> is initially partially doubled over as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> so that a space exists between brace members <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates steps carried out when applying the brace in its configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> to a threaded rod <b>30</b>. Quite simply, the brace first is oriented to receive the rod and the brace is positioned with the rod aligned with slots <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. Next, the brace is turned ninety degrees and positioned at the desired location on the rod <b>30</b>. This can readily be accomplished without disconnecting the rod from any structure to which is has been previously attached.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The user of the brace then presses the brace members <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> into face-to-face engagement. The elements of the doubled over strip <b>44</b> are also pressed into engagement to maintain the brace members <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in face-to-face engagement even after outside pressure has been removed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows a nut <b>46</b> threaded downwardly on the rod <b>30</b> into engagement with the brace, but this is not actually necessary to maintain the brace members in face-to-face relationship since the doubled over strip performs that function.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the brace <b>10</b> attached to a building structural member <b>50</b>. This is accomplished by a threaded connector such as bolt <b>52</b> extending through the structural element and cooperable with a nut (not shown) to secure the brace <b>10</b> in position. This is typically done after the rod has been captured by the brace. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> a portion of a rod <b>30</b> is shown in phantom.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">It is to be noted that the brace members <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> cooperate to create a very strong and secure installation even though the sheet metal material utilized to construct the brace is not necessarily very thick. Where the brace <b>10</b> is connected by connector <b>52</b> the brace is of double layer construction all the way between the connector and the rod. The only location where there is not a two-ply or double layer structure is in the locations of slots <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows how two braces <b>10</b> can be stacked to provide additional strength. The attachment element (doubled over strip <b>44</b>) of one of the braces is positioned in the connector receiving openings <b>40</b> of the other brace <b>10</b> to restrict relative movement between the braces. Any rod inserted in the stacked braces would be surrounded by at least two layers of brace material, mostly by four layers. The bent, doubled over strip <b>44</b> of each brace is, as previously indicated, permanently deformed when the brace is placed into position and four layers of brace material disposed face-to-face are in the stack.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> illustrate an alternative form of brace <b>10</b>A which differs from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-5</figref> only by virtue of the fact that the brace member <b>12</b>A is not as long as brace member <b>14</b>, the brace member <b>12</b>A not including a connector portion <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> illustrate another embodiment of the brace, brace <b>58</b>. In this embodiment, a brace member <b>60</b> is welded to a second brace member <b>62</b>, the latter being shown as thicker than the former.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">The brace members <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> are fixedly secured together by weld material <b>64</b> located at one end of the brace <b>10</b>B at a location where the outer peripheral surfaces of the brace members coincide or register. Bonding materials other than weld material may be utilized to bond the ends of the brace members <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> together.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">A nonrigid connection apparatus includes a frame-side member securable to a steel structural frame, a brace-side member securable to a seismic brace, and a coupling element that nonrigidly secures the frame-side and brace-side members to each other. By way of example, the nonrigid connection element may provide a hinge-type connection, which substantially isolates a seismic brace from nonaxial loads. As another example, the nonrigid connection element may be a ball-and-socket type connection, which substantially isolates a seismic brace from nonaxial loads and absorbs any shear and moment applied thereto when the seismic brace drifts out of an intended plane of the steel structural frame. The nonrigid connection element may also include a collar to stabilize the brace-side member and prevent shears and moments from causing the same to buckle in an unintended direction. Methods of installing and using the nonrigid connection apparatus are also disclosed.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e501" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention relates generally to connection apparatus for use with seismic braces and, more specifically, to nonrigid connection apparatus for seismic braces. In particular, the present invention relates to connection apparatus which prevent seismic and gravitational loads on steel structural frames from being applied nonaxially to seismic braces. By way of example, the connection apparatus may allow the brace to pivot relative to a structural frame.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Background of Related Art</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">In many areas of the world, particularly seismically active areas, large buildings and other structures may be subjected to seismic loads. In order to prevent structures from being damaged by seismic loads, particularly the vibrations that follow the application of seismic loads to structures, or to at least reduce the amount of damage that seismic loading may cause to such structures, various shock-absorption devices have been developed.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">One such shock absorption device, which is useful with steel structural frames, is commonly referred to as a &#x201c;seismic brace.&#x201d; As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pair of seismic braces <b>10</b> is often arranged within each &#x201c;bay&#x201d; <b>32</b> of a steel structural frame <b>30</b>, each bay <b>32</b> typically being formed by an adjacent pair of substantially horizontally oriented steel beams <b>34</b> (e.g., beams <b>34</b>u, <b>34</b>L shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and an adjacent pair of substantially vertically oriented steel columns <b>36</b>. Bottom corners <b>38</b> of each bay <b>32</b> are formed at junctions between a lower substantially horizontally oriented steel beam <b>34</b>L and the substantially vertically oriented steel columns <b>36</b> at each side of bay <b>32</b>. Lower ends <b>12</b>L of seismic braces <b>10</b> are typically secured at opposite bottom corners <b>38</b> of bay <b>32</b>. Upper ends <b>12</b>u of seismic braces <b>10</b> are typically secured to an upper substantially horizontally oriented steel beam <b>34</b>u at adjacent, substantially central locations thereof. As such, the two seismic braces <b>10</b> within a bay <b>32</b> of steel structural frame <b>30</b> are arranged in an inverted &#x201c;V&#x201d; configuration. Other, similar arrangements of seismic braces are also known, including &#x201c;V&#x201d; configurations, alternative &#x201c;V&#x201d; and inverted &#x201c;V&#x201d; configurations, a single, diagonally oriented seismic brace <b>10</b> in each bay <b>32</b> and another, oppositely oriented seismic brace <b>10</b> in the next laterally adjacent bay <b>32</b> (i.e., such that seismic braces <b>10</b> in two adjacent bays <b>32</b> form a &#x201c;V&#x201d; or inverted &#x201c;V&#x201d;), and the like. By arranging seismic braces <b>10</b> in this manner, when a seismic, or earthquake, load is applied to the structure of which steel structural frame <b>30</b> is a part, typically by shearing bay <b>32</b> in the directions of arrows <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, one seismic brace <b>10</b><i>a </i>of a pair will be subjected to a compressive load, depicted by arrows <b>44</b>, while a tensile load, illustrated by arrows <b>46</b>, will be applied to the other seismic brace <b>10</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Conventionally, seismic braces have been rigidly secured to the beams <b>34</b> and/or columns <b>36</b> of steel structural frames <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 2B</figref> illustrate an exemplary conventional connection, which includes the use of planar gusset plates <b>15</b> that are welded into place relative to a beam <b>34</b> and/or a column <b>36</b> and which have perpendicular extensions <b>16</b> welded to each side thereof. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a cross-section taken perpendicular to the planes of both gusset plate <b>15</b> and extensions <b>16</b> thereof has a generally cruciform shape and, thus, four interior corners <b>17</b>. Thus, each gusset plate <b>15</b> is configured complementarily to the exposed end <b>12</b> of a yielding core <b>11</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of a seismic brace <b>10</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>), which also typically has a cross-section, taken transverse to the length thereof, that is generally cruciform in shape and, thus, includes four interior corners <b>13</b> that extend along the length thereof, as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>B. The cross-section of an exposed end <b>12</b> of a yielding core <b>11</b> of a seismic brace <b>10</b> and the corresponding features of the cross-section taken through gusset plate <b>15</b> and extensions <b>16</b> thereof may have substantially the same dimensions. A rigid connection between these two elements is typically effected by way of intermediate securing elements <b>19</b>, which are typically referred to as &#x201c;splice plates,&#x201d; positionable across portions of both an exposed end <b>12</b> and a gusset plate <b>15</b>/extension <b>16</b>, within corresponding interior corners <b>13</b> and <b>17</b>. Each intermediate securing element <b>19</b> includes apertures <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> formed therethrough, which respectively align with corresponding apertures <b>14</b> formed through exposed ends <b>12</b> of yielding core <b>11</b> and apertures <b>18</b> formed through gusset plate <b>15</b> and extensions <b>16</b> therefrom. Apertures <b>14</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, and <b>21</b> are typically configured to receive bolts <b>22</b>, which, along with complementarily threaded nuts <b>23</b>, secure intermediate securing elements <b>19</b> in place with respect to both gusset plates <b>15</b> and exposed ends <b>12</b> of yielding core <b>11</b>, thereby securing seismic braces <b>10</b> into place relative to steel structural frame <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">A seismic brace <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is secured to a steel structural frame <b>30</b> by aligning exposed ends <b>12</b> of a yielding core <b>11</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of each seismic brace <b>10</b> with a corresponding gusset plate <b>15</b> that has already been secured to one or more of a beam <b>34</b> and/or a column <b>36</b> of steel structural frame <b>30</b>, as well as with extensions <b>16</b> that have been secured to that gusset plate <b>15</b>. Intermediate securing elements <b>19</b> are then positioned within interior corners <b>13</b> and <b>17</b>, then bolted (e.g., with bolts <b>22</b> and complementarily threaded nuts <b>23</b>) to gusset plate <b>15</b>, extensions <b>16</b> therefrom, and exposed end <b>12</b>. As shown, the connection of exposed ends <b>12</b> to gusset plate <b>15</b> is typically established by way of four intermediate securing elements <b>19</b> which have L-shaped cross-sections, taken transverse to the lengths thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in addition to applying loads axially to seismic braces as a result of the shear generated by seismic and gravitational loads, rigid connections of this type typically transfer additional shears and moments, which are generated as a seismic brace <b>10</b> drifts laterally. Application of shear and moment to a yielding core <b>11</b> of a seismic brace <b>10</b> along vectors which are not located in a plane of bay <b>32</b> undesirably causes a bending moment and shear stress to be applied to yielding core <b>11</b>, which, along with compressive loads applied thereto, results in a so-called &#x201c;combined stress&#x201d; that is greater on one side of yielding core <b>11</b> than on the other and that may cause seismic brace <b>10</b> to buckle in an unintended direction. When such buckling occurs, seismic brace <b>10</b> is no longer useful for either shock absorption or structural support.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Thus, a connection apparatus which substantially isolates a seismic brace from nonaxially oriented loads, as well as that reinforces or isolates the seismic brace from shears and moments that occur as a seismic brace drifts from a plane of a bay of a steel structural frame in which the seismic brace is located, would be an improvement over the existing art of which the inventors are aware.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1299" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">A nonrigid connection apparatus according to the present invention includes a first member, or frame-side member, which is configured to be rigidly secured to a structural frame, a second member, or brace-side member, which is configured to be secured to a core member of a seismic brace, and a coupling member. The frame-side member and brace-side member both include nonrigid coupling elements which are configured to receive or to be received by complementary portions of the connection member.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">In an exemplary embodiment, the frame-side member of the inventive nonrigid connection apparatus may comprise a substantially planar gusset plate. The gusset plate of the frame-side member is configured to be welded into a corner formed at a junction between two structural steel frame members. The gusset plate includes an aperture, which is substantially circular in shape, formed therethrough. The brace-side member may include two knife plates which are spaced apart from one another a sufficient distance that the gusset plate may be interleaved therewith. Both elements of the brace-side member also include apertures, which are in alignment with one another and alignable with the aperture of the frame-side member. The apertures of the elements of the brace-side member may have substantially the same size and configuration (e.g., substantially circular) as the aperture of the frame-side member. Upon assembly of the frame-side and brace-side members with the apertures in substantial alignment, the coupling member, which may have a substantially cylindrical central section, may be introduced into the apertures and secured in place relative to the frame-side and brace-side members, thereby nonrigidly coupling the frame-side and brace-side members of the nonrigid connection apparatus to one another.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">The coupling member of the nonrigid connection apparatus may be held in place by way of enlarged heads at the ends thereof, bent regions at the ends thereof, securing elements that extend through apertures near the ends thereof, transversely to the length of the coupling member (e.g., like cotter pins), or by other position-retaining means.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">The knife plates of the brace-side member are secured in place relative to a load-bearing member, or &#x201c;core,&#x201d; of a seismic brace. For example, the knife plates may be welded directly to the core or to an intermediate member which is, in turn, welded to the core. These arrangements facilitate the positioning of an end of a yielding core closer to the structural steel frame than do conventional, rigid connections, which typically consume a significant portion of the fixed distance between brace connection locations. Thus, nonrigid connection apparatus according to the present invention may facilitate the use of seismic braces which include yielding cores that are longer than the yielding cores of conventional seismic braces that may be used at the same location of a structural steel frame. As is well known in the art, an increase in the length of a yielding core means that the strain rate on the yielding core will be less, resulting in a fatigue life which is longer than the fatigue life of a similar brace secured at a similar location using conventional, rigid connection apparatus.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">Additionally, a nonrigid connection apparatus according to the present invention may include a collar with one or more members that extend over a junction between the brace-side member and the end of a seismic brace on which the nonrigid connection apparatus is used. By way of example only, a first end of each member of a collar may be secured to one or both of a portion of the brace-side member (e.g., the knife plates or intermediate member) or to the core of a seismic brace with which the nonrigid connection apparatus is used, while a second end of each collar member may be positioned adjacent to an external shell, or shell, sleeve, or tube exterior, or other exterior surface of the seismic brace. The collar may be permitted to slide longitudinally relative to the external sleeve as the yielding core is compressed and elongated. It is currently preferred that at least a portion of the collar member extend over and substantially parallel to an end portion of the external shell or other exterior surface of the seismic brace.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Such a nonrigid connection apparatus may be used with a variety of types of compression and tension-type seismic braces, including those with single, somewhat planar yielding cores, as well as those with multiple cores. The collar of the nonrigid connection apparatus may also be used with other types of connection apparatus, including known, rigid connection apparatus for seismic braces. The collar is particularly useful with seismic braces that include axial-load-bearing cores that are surrounded by buckling-limiting material encased by external sleeves.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">In another embodiment, the frame-side member of a nonrigid connection apparatus according to the present invention may include a pair of gusset plates, while the brace-side member of such a nonrigid connection apparatus comprises an exposed end of a core of a seismic brace or an extension therefrom which is rigidly secured thereto. The gusset plates of the frame-side member are configured to be secured to a steel structural frame in spaced-apart relation to one another and oriented substantially parallel to each other, with an aperture formed through each gusset plate being in substantial alignment with an aperture of the other gusset plate. The brace-side member is configured to be positioned between the gusset plates such that an aperture thereof substantially aligns with the substantially aligned apertures of the gusset plates. Upon arranging and assembling the frame-side and brace-side members in this manner, a coupling member, such as an elongate member with a substantially cylindrical center section (e.g., a pin, bolt, etc.), may be introduced into the substantially aligned apertures.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">Of course, other arrangements and configurations of apparatus for nonrigidly connecting seismic braces to steel structural frames are also within the scope of the present invention. For example, another embodiment of nonrigid connection apparatus that incorporates teachings of the present invention may comprise a ball-and-socket type connection apparatus. The first member, or frame-side member, of such a connection apparatus, which is securable to a steel structural frame, may comprise a socket. The socket may, for example, be in the form of an aperture with a concave edge. The coupling member of such a connection apparatus may comprise a ball, which may be spherical in shape, an oblong spheroid, disc-shaped, or otherwise configured to fit within the socket of the frame-side member and rotate somewhat relative to the frame-side member. The coupling member may also include one or more pins protruding from opposite sides thereof. The second member, or brace-side member, of a ball-and-socket type connection apparatus includes a pair of substantially planar members which are spaced apart a sufficient distance that the ball of the coupling member may be positioned therebetween. An aperture formed through each substantially planar member is configured to receive a portion of a pin protruding from the ball and, thus, facilitates hinged movement of the brace-side member and of a seismic brace to which the brace-side member is secured relative to one or both of the ball and the frame-side member of the connection apparatus.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">In use, the frame-side member of a nonrigid connection apparatus of the present invention is secured to a steel structural frame, such as in a corner formed between conjoined horizontal beams and vertical steel columns. Continuing with the above examples, this may be effected by welding or otherwise securing one or more gusset plates into such a corner. The brace-side member of the nonrigid connection apparatus, which, preferably, has already been secured to or formed at the end of a core of a seismic brace, is then positioned appropriately relative to the frame-side member, such that apertures of the frame-side and brace-side members are substantially mutually aligned. A coupling member is then introduced into the aligned apertures so as to be positioned within each of the substantially aligned apertures of the frame-side and brace-side members. The coupling member is then secured in this position to prevent inadvertent removal thereof from the apertures. The opposite end of the seismic brace may then be similarly secured to another (higher or lower) horizontally extending steel beam. Alternatively, another type of connection, including a rigid, conventional connection, may be used to secure the other end of the seismic brace to the other horizontally extending beam. As a single pin is secured in position rather than several bolts, as required by conventional, rigid connection apparatus, erection of a seismic brace that includes a nonrigid connection apparatus according to the present invention is simpler and faster than erection with conventional, rigid connection apparatus.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">When a building that includes a frame with one or more seismic braces connected thereto by way of a nonrigid connection apparatus of the present invention is subjected to a load, such as that generated by shock waves (e.g., seismic shock waves, high winds, etc.), the nonrigid connection apparatus and the adjacent end of the seismic brace are substantially isolated from external moments that result from movement of the seismic brace out of the plane of the bay of a steel structural frame in which the seismic brace is located. The collar resists in-plane and out-of-plane moments on the exposed portions of the core of the seismic brace, as well as of the remainder of the nonrigid connection apparatus, thereby permitting only substantially axial loads to be applied to the core, providing support to the core and the remainder of the nonrigid connection apparatus, and preventing weak axis buckling of the core. In addition, the nonrigid connection apparatus reduces the moments and shears that result from the application of gravity and earthquake loads to a steel structural frame by providing a larger moment of inertia at the ends of the core of a seismic brace. As a result, the nonrigid connection element substantially limits the forces that are applied to the seismic brace to those which may be properly absorbed thereby.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">As a further result of providing a nonrigid connection, the likelihood of a nonrigid connection apparatus according to the present invention being damaged when subjected to gravity and earthquake loads is much lower than the likelihood of a conventional rigid connection being damaged. Thus, following failure due to absorption of excessive earthquake loads, a seismic brace which is at least partially secured to a steel structural frame by way of one or more of the inventive nonrigid connection apparatus may still have some load-bearing capabilities and, thus, provide some structural support to a steel structural frame, whereas seismic braces that are secured in place by weakened conventional rigid connections would be less likely to provide such support.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art through a consideration of the ensuing description, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.</p>

While gusset plate <b>152</b> is shown in the illustrated example as being secured in a corner formed at a junction between a horizontally oriented beam <b>34</b> and a vertically oriented column <b>36</b>, gusset plate <b>152</b> may be secured to any suitable surface (i.e., within a bay <b>32</b> of steel structural frame <b>30</b>) of a single beam <b>34</b> or column <b>36</b>. Also, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts gusset plate <b>152</b> as being held in place by welds <b>153</b>, other fixing means for securing gusset plate <b>152</b> into position (e.g., rivets, bolts, etc., for securing gusset plate <b>152</b> to a lip (not shown) protruding from beam <b>34</b> and column <b>36</b>) are also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">The dimensions of gusset plate <b>152</b> and the type of fixing means used to secure the same to a steel structural frame <b>30</b>, including the height, length, and thickness thereof, are configured to withstand predetermined amounts of load, moment, and other stresses. Accordingly, the dimensions of gusset plate <b>152</b> depend at least partially upon the material (e.g., the type of steel) from which gusset plate <b>152</b> is fabricated, as well as the size of seismic brace <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to be used therewith, the location of a steel structural frame <b>30</b> at which seismic brace <b>100</b> is to be used, and other factors, as known in the art.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">Gusset plate <b>152</b> of frame-side member <b>150</b> of connection apparatus <b>120</b> includes an aperture <b>154</b> therethrough.

Upon positioning substantially planar knife plates <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> on opposite sides of a gusset plate <b>152</b> which has been fixed into position relative to a steel structural frame <b>30</b> into an appropriate assembled relationship, apertures <b>137</b> and <b>139</b> of substantially planar knife plates <b>136</b> and <b>138</b>, respectively, are in substantial alignment with aperture <b>154</b> of gusset plate <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, apertures <b>137</b>, <b>139</b>, and <b>154</b> are sized and configured to receive a central portion <b>162</b> of a coupling member <b>160</b> of nonrigid connection apparatus <b>120</b>. When positioned within apertures <b>137</b>, <b>139</b>, and <b>154</b> of assembled brace-side and frame-side members <b>130</b> and <b>150</b>, respectively, coupling member <b>160</b> nonrigidly couples brace-side member <b>130</b> and frame-side member <b>150</b> in the assembled relationship thereof. In this case, the nonrigid coupling is a hinged connection, at which movement may occur in substantially a single plane and at a substantially single pivot point.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">Coupling member <b>160</b> is held in place within apertures <b>137</b>, <b>139</b>, and <b>154</b> by position-retaining elements <b>164</b>, such as enlarged heads or nuts at the ends thereof, bent regions at the ends thereof, securing elements that extend through apertures near the ends thereof, transversely to the length of the coupling member <b>160</b> (e.g., like cotter pins), or the like. Of course, combinations of different types of position-retaining elements <b>164</b> may be used to secure a coupling member <b>160</b> into place relative to frame-side member <b>150</b> and brace-side member <b>130</b> of nonrigid connection apparatus <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00055" num="00055">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a support collar <b>170</b> is also depicted. Support collar <b>170</b> includes a distal end <b>175</b>, which is configured to be positioned at or near brace-side member <b>130</b> of nonrigid connection apparatus <b>120</b>, and a proximal end <b>176</b>, which is configured to extend at least partially over an end <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> of exterior shell <b>102</b>. Proximal end <b>176</b> of support collar <b>170</b> may be permitted to slide relative to a length of exterior shell <b>102</b>. As proximal end <b>176</b> of support collar <b>170</b> is to be positioned over an end <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> of exterior shell <b>102</b>, at least the portion of a hollow center <b>173</b> thereof which is to receive an end <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> of exterior shell <b>102</b> has internal dimensions which are roughly the same as or slightly greater than the corresponding external dimensions of that end <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>. When properly positioned over an end <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> of a yielding core <b>110</b> of a seismic brace <b>100</b> (FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>), support collar <b>170</b> substantially isolates yielding core <b>110</b> from external shear and moment, instead absorbing some of the external shear and moment and transmitting external shear and moment to exterior shell <b>102</b>. Thus, such positioning of seismic brace <b>100</b> isolates ends <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> against loads that are placed transversely on seismic brace <b>100</b> with respect to the axis or length thereof.</p>
