<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to the monitoring and diagnosis of the performance of an exhaust oxygen sensor in an apparatus having an internal combustion engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Vehicle powertrains are often equipped with exhaust gas oxygen sensors for monitoring an oxygen content of exhaust gases in a vehicle exhaust conduit. Various types of exhaust oxygen sensors are known, including but not limited to universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensors. Unlike some exhaust gas sensors that merely indicate a presence or absence of oxygen, UEGO sensors provide an output that is proportional to the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gas, and thereby allow a ratio of air and fuel supplied to the vehicle engine to be monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, UEGO sensors may show a large variability in output during lean air/fuel conditions (i.e. during periods of high exhaust oxygen content), and/or with aging. Furthermore, UEGO sensors may show significant drift during periods of elevated exhaust temperature and/or exhaust pressure, for example, during particulate filter regeneration. Improper performance of a UEGO sensor may lead to improper engine operation, as an engine controller may use an output of a UEGO sensor to adjust amounts of air and fuel provided to an engine as driving conditions change.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, in one approach, problems with the consistency of an oxygen sensor output may be at least partially addressed in an apparatus comprising an internal combustion engine, an exhaust oxygen gas sensor and a particulate filter by determining a first air/fuel ratio from a signal from an exhaust oxygen sensor; determining a second air/fuel ratio from a temperature upstream of the particulate filter, a pressure differential across the particulate filter and one or more of an airflow into the engine and a fuel flow into the engine; comparing the first air/fuel ratio and the second air/fuel ratio; and diagnosing an error condition of the oxygen sensor if the first air/fuel ratio does not meet a predetermined condition relative to the second air/fuel ratio. In this manner, the use of erroneous output of an oxygen sensor to adjust an engine operating condition may be avoided.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPICTED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described in further detail herein, there may be significant variation in the output of an oxygen sensor, such as a UEGO sensor, under some operating conditions. One strategy to address this issue involves determining a first air/fuel ratio from the output of the sensor, determining a second air/fuel ratio from a pressure drop across an emissions system particulate filter in combination with other engine variables, and comparing the first air/fuel ratio and the second air/fuel ratio. Significant discrepancy of these two air/fuel ratios may indicate that the output of the oxygen sensor is erroneous. In some embodiments, two or more air/fuel ratios may be calculated from engine variables and compared to the air/fuel ratio determined from the oxygen sensor output to thereby provide additional certainty to the determination. Likewise, different methods of calculating air/fuel ratios may be used during different engine operating conditions. For example, one method of calculating an air/fuel ratio may be used during relatively richer operation, while another may be used during relatively leaner operation. In the event that a measured air/fuel ratio is determined to be erroneous, the erroneous measurement may be disregarded and a new measurement may be obtained from the oxygen sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various examples of the approaches described herein may be understood with respect to an example engine and exhaust system, such as that described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example internal combustion engine <b>10</b> comprising a plurality of combustion chambers, only one of which is shown. The engine <b>10</b> may be controlled by electronic engine controller <b>12</b>. In one example, engine <b>10</b> may be a common rail direct injection diesel engine.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Combustion chamber <b>30</b> of engine <b>10</b> includes combustion chamber walls <b>32</b> with piston <b>36</b> positioned therein and connected to crankshaft <b>40</b>. Combustion chamber <b>30</b> is shown communicating with intake manifold <b>44</b> and exhaust manifold <b>48</b> via intake valve <b>52</b> and exhaust valve <b>54</b>. While this example shows a single intake and exhaust valve, one or more cylinders may include a plurality of intake and/or exhaust valves.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Fuel injector <b>66</b> is shown directly coupled to combustion chamber <b>30</b> for delivering liquid fuel directly therein in proportion to the pulse width of signal fpw received from controller <b>12</b> via electronic driver <b>68</b>. Fuel may be delivered by a fuel system (not shown) including a fuel tank, fuel pumps, and a common fuel rail (not shown). In some embodiments, engine <b>10</b> may include a plurality of combustion chambers each having a plurality of intake and/or exhaust valves.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Intake manifold <b>44</b> may include a throttle body <b>42</b> and a throttle <b>62</b> having a throttle plate <b>64</b>. In this particular example, the position of throttle plate <b>64</b> may be varied by controller <b>12</b> via a signal provided to an electric motor or actuator included with throttle <b>62</b>, a configuration that is commonly referred to as electronic throttle control (ETC). In this manner, throttle <b>62</b> may be operated to vary the intake air provided to combustion chamber <b>30</b> among other engine cylinders. The position of throttle plate <b>64</b> may be provided to controller <b>12</b> by throttle position signal TP. Intake manifold <b>42</b> may also include a mass air flow sensor <b>120</b> and a manifold air pressure sensor <b>122</b> for providing respective signals MAF and MAP to controller <b>12</b>. Further, a turbocharger system is schematically shown, which comprises an intake compressor <b>90</b> and an exhaust turbine <b>92</b> connected by a shaft <b>94</b>. While compressor <b>90</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as being downstream of throttle <b>62</b>, it will be appreciated that compressor <b>90</b> may also be located upstream of throttle <b>62</b>. Further, throttles may be located both upstream and downstream of compressor <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Catalytic converter <b>70</b> is shown in communication with exhaust manifold <b>48</b>. In some embodiments, catalytic converter <b>70</b> may be a lean NOx trap (LNT). Further, a diesel particulate filter (DPF) <b>72</b> is shown downstream of catalytic converter <b>70</b>. The DPF may operate actively or passively, and the filtering medium can be of various types of material and geometric construction. One example construction includes a wall-flow ceramic monolith comprising alternating channels that are plugged at opposite ends, thus forcing the exhaust flow through the common wall of the adjacent channels whereupon the particulate matter is deposited.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">While this example shows the LNT upstream of a DPF, the DPF may also be positioned upstream of the LNT. Furthermore, other catalytic devices, including but not limited to a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC, not shown), may be used. The NOx trap, DPF and/or other catalytic device may also be combined in one converter assembly, if desired. For example, although the LNT and DPF are normally viewed as separate entities, it is possible to combine the two on one substrate, e.g., a wall-flow ceramic DPF element coated with NOx storage agents and platinum group metals.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To provide more accurate control of engine operation and/or exhaust air-fuel ratio, one or more exhaust sensors may be used in the exhaust system. For example, a UEGO sensor <b>80</b> is provided to monitor an exhaust gas oxygen concentration, and to provide an exhaust gas oxygen signal to controller <b>12</b>. Further, a differential pressure sensor <b>82</b> may be used to monitor a pressure drop across DPF <b>72</b>, and a temperature sensor <b>84</b> may be used to monitor an exhaust gas temperature upstream of DPF <b>72</b>. Further, various additional exhaust sensors may also be used, including but not limited to various NOx sensors, ammonia sensors, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Controller <b>12</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a microcomputer including: microprocessor unit <b>102</b>, input/output ports <b>104</b>, an electronic storage medium of executing programs and calibration values, shown as read-only memory (ROM) chip <b>106</b> in this particular example, random access memory (RAM) <b>108</b>, keep alive memory (KAM) <b>110</b>, and a data bus (I/O). Controller <b>12</b> may include code stored on computer readable medium that can be executed by the controller. Controller <b>12</b> is also shown receiving various signals from sensors coupled to engine <b>10</b>, in addition to those signals previously discussed, including: engine coolant temperature (ECT) from temperature sensor <b>112</b> coupled to cooling sleeve <b>114</b>; a profile ignition pickup signal (PIP) from Hall effect sensor <b>118</b> coupled to crankshaft <b>40</b> giving an indication of engine speed (RPM); throttle position TP from throttle position sensor <b>120</b>; and absolute Manifold Pressure Signal MAP from sensor <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Combustion in engine <b>10</b> can be of various types, depending on operating conditions. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a compression ignition engine, it will be appreciated that the embodiments described herein may be used in any suitable engine, including but not limited to, diesel and gasoline compression ignition engines, spark ignition engines, direct or port injection engines, etc. Further, various fuels and/or fuel mixtures such as diesel, bio-diesel, etc, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As mentioned above, the output of UEGO sensor <b>80</b> may show relatively large variability at lean conditions, with sensor aging, during periods of high exhaust temperatures and/or pressures (such as during particulate filter regeneration), etc. Because controller <b>12</b> utilizes the output of UEGO sensor <b>80</b> to control various engine operating conditions, including but not limited to air mass flow, fuel flow, valve timing, injection timing, etc., variability in the output of UEGO sensor <b>80</b> may lead to controller <b>12</b> adjusting engine operating conditions based upon erroneous sensor output. To overcome such issues, controller <b>12</b> may be configured to verify the output of UEGO sensor <b>80</b> by comparing an air/fuel ratio determined from the sensor output with one or more air/fuel ratios calculated from other engine variables.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Controller <b>12</b> may utilize any suitable engine variables to calculate one or more air/fuel ratios for verifying the UEGO sensor output signal. For example, controller <b>12</b> may utilize a pressure drop across DPF <b>72</b>, in combination with other engine variables, to calculate one or more air/fuel ratios for verifying the UEGO sensor output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The pressure across DPF <b>72</b> is a function of the soot loading of the DPF. As the soot level in the DPF increases, the pressure differential across the DPF also increases for a given mass flow through the exhaust system. The soot loading may be mathematically expressed as R<sub>D </sub>by the following equation.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, equation (4) is used to calculate the air/fuel ratio during relatively richer operation (which, in a diesel engine, may be a lean ratio closer to stoichiometry), while equation (5) is used to calculate the air/fuel ratio during relatively leaner operation (i.e. farther from stoichiometry). In another embodiment, air/fuel ratios are calculated by both equations (4) and (5), and both calculated air/fuel ratios are compared to the air/fuel ratio determined from the UEGO sensor output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a flow diagram of an embodiment of a method <b>200</b> for monitoring a performance of an oxygen sensor. It will be appreciated that method <b>200</b> may be used with any suitable oxygen sensor, including but not limited to UEGO sensors. Method <b>200</b> first includes, at <b>202</b>, determining an exhaust temperature upstream of the DPF, and at <b>204</b>, determining an exhaust pressure upstream of the DPF. The exhaust temperature and pressure may be determined in any suitable manner. First regarding the exhaust temperature, the temperature may be directly measured via a sensor disposed in the exhaust system upstream of the DPF (as indicated at <b>84</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and/or may be calculated from engine variables.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Next regarding the exhaust pressure upstream of the DPF, in one embodiment, the pressure may be determined by measuring a pressure drop across the DPF (at <b>206</b>) for example, via differential pressure detector <b>82</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and then calculating an upstream pressure by adding (at <b>208</b>) the differential pressure to an assumed fixed downstream pressure. The assumed fixed downstream pressure may be atmospheric pressure where the DPF is the last exhaust treatment device in the exhaust conduit, may be somewhat higher than atmospheric pressure when other exhaust treatment devices are located downstream of the DPF, or may have any other suitable value.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, at <b>210</b>, the soot load factor R<sub>D </sub>is determined, for example, via a look-up table based upon the differential pressure across the DPF and other engine variables (such as exhaust mass flow). Then, at <b>212</b>, a first air/fuel ratio is acquired from the oxygen sensor, and it is determined, at <b>214</b>, whether the engine is operating under richer or leaner conditions compared, for example, to a preselected air/fuel ratio, which may be leaner than stoichiometry. If the engine is operating under richer conditions, then a fuel flow rate is measured at <b>216</b>, and a second air/fuel ratio is calculated, at <b>218</b>, from the exhaust pressure upstream of the DPF, the exhaust temperature upstream of the DPF, R<sub>D</sub>, and the fuel flow rate using equation (4) above. On the other hand, if the engine is operating under leaner conditions, then a mass air flow is measured, at <b>220</b>, and a second air/fuel ratio is calculated, at <b>222</b>, from the exhaust pressure upstream of the DPF, the exhaust temperature upstream of the DPF, R<sub>D</sub>, and the mass air flow using equation (5) above.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Method <b>200</b> next comprises comparing, at <b>224</b>, the first and second air/fuel ratios to determine if the first and second air/fuel ratios have a predetermined relationship to one another. Any suitable comparison may be made of the first and second air/fuel ratios. For example, it may be determined whether the first ratio is within a preselected percentage of the second ratio, whether the first ratio is within a preselected number of statistical deviations of the second ratio, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">If it is determined that the first and second air/fuel ratios meet the predetermined relationship to one another, then method <b>200</b> comprises, at <b>226</b>, using the first air/fuel ratio to adjust an engine operating condition. On the other hand, if it is determined at the first and second air/fuel ratios do not meet the predetermined relationship to one another, then the first air/fuel ratio is diagnosed at <b>228</b> as an error. In this case, method <b>200</b> returns to <b>202</b> and begins anew. New values of the exhaust temperature and temperature are acquired, a new first air/fuel ratio is acquired, and a new second air/fuel ratio is calculated and compared to the first air fuel ratio. If the new first air/fuel ratio is found to meet the predetermined relationship with the new second air/fuel ratio, then the new first air/fuel ratio is used, at <b>228</b>, to adjust an engine operating condition. In this manner, method <b>200</b> may loop until an air/fuel ratio determined to be of sufficient reliability is acquired. In some embodiments, the occurrence of repeated error diagnoses, or even a single error diagnosis, may trigger an indicator light to alert an operator of the sensor error.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a flow diagram of another embodiment of a method for monitoring a performance of an oxygen sensor in an exhaust system. Method <b>300</b> comprises, at <b>302</b>, determining an exhaust temperature upstream of the DPF, and, at <b>304</b>, determining an exhaust pressure upstream of the DPF, as described above for method <b>200</b>. Method <b>300</b> further comprises measuring a mass air flow (at <b>306</b>), measuring a fuel flow rate (at <b>308</b>), and looking up the DPF soot loading factor R<sub>D </sub>(at <b>310</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, method <b>300</b> comprises, at <b>312</b>, acquiring a first air/fuel ratio from an oxygen sensor. Further, method <b>300</b> comprises, at <b>314</b> and <b>316</b>, calculating second and third air/fuel ratios. The second air/fuel ratio is calculated from the exhaust pressure upstream of the DPF (for example, as determined from a differential pressure measurement across the sensor), the exhaust temperature upstream of the DPF, R<sub>D</sub>, and the measured mass air flow, while the third air/fuel ratio is calculated from the exhaust pressure upstream of the DPF, the exhaust temperature upstream of the DPF, R<sub>D</sub>, and the measured fuel flow rate. Next, it is determined at <b>318</b> whether the first, second, and third air/fuel ratios meet a predetermined relationship (or one or more predetermined relationships) to one another. If so, then the first air/fuel ratio is used, at <b>320</b>, to adjust an engine operating condition. On the other hand, if it is determined at the first, second and third air/fuel ratios do not meet the predetermined relationship to one another, then the sensor reading is diagnosed at <b>228</b> as erroneous, and method <b>300</b> returns to <b>302</b> to begin anew. In this manner, method <b>300</b> may loop (as described above for method <b>200</b>) until an air/fuel ratio determined to be of sufficient reliability is acquired. Any suitable predetermined relationship may be used to determine whether the first, second and third air/fuel ratios are within sufficiently close agreement to determine that the reading is not in error. For example, it may be determined whether the first ratio is within a preselected percentage of the both the second and third ratios, whether the first ratio is within a preselected number of statistical deviations of the second and third ratios, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It will be appreciated that the steps of methods <b>200</b> and <b>300</b> may be performed in any suitable order, including but not limited to those shown, and/or that one or more steps may be performed in parallel in various embodiments. Additionally, while described in the context of a UEGO sensor, it will be appreciated that the concepts described herein may be used with any other suitable sensor, including but not limited to a combination UEGO/NOx sensor. Further, it will be appreciated that the configurations and routines disclosed herein are exemplary in nature, and that these specific embodiments are not to be considered in a limiting sense, because numerous variations are possible. The subject matter of the present disclosure includes all novel and nonobvious combinations and subcombinations of the various systems and configurations, and other features, functions, and/or properties disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The following claims particularly point out certain combinations and subcombinations regarded as novel and nonobvious. These claims may refer to &#x201c;an&#x201d; element or &#x201c;a first&#x201d; element or the equivalent thereof. Such claims should be understood to include incorporation of one or more such elements, neither requiring nor excluding two or more such elements. Other combinations and subcombinations of the disclosed features, functions, elements, and/or properties may be claimed through amendment of the present claims or through presentation of new claims in this or a related application. Such claims, whether broader, narrower, equal, or different in scope to the original claims, also are regarded as included within the subject matter of the present disclosure.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A cut-out circuit for an air conditioner protects the air conditioning system components when subjected to low pressure conditions, without manually resetting the system after low pressure cut-out. The cut-out circuit preferably includes a relay, connectable to a voltage source through a normally closed low pressure switch to a compressor clutch, the relay operable in a closed state to output a voltage from the voltage source through the low pressure switch to the clutch, and in an open state to interrupt the voltage. The low pressure switch may open responsive to a low pressure condition interrupting voltage flow to the clutch.

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to an air-conditioning system, and, more particularly, a cut-out circuit for an air conditioner, which circuit is automatically operable for disengaging a clutch of the air conditioner responsive to an predetermined low pressure drop in a low pressure side of the air conditioner, and which is automatically operable for reengaging the compressor when the pressure drop is alleviated, while at the same time, a companion high pressure cut-out portion of the circuit is automatically operable for deactivating the compressor responsive to presence of a high pressure condition in a high pressure side, so as to require manually action to reactivate the compressor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/813,741 filed Jun. 14, 2006 is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A properly functioning air conditioner is vital for the cab on a tractor loader backhoe. Between the large area of window glass, and the high heat dissipation of the hydraulics and power train, a backhoe air conditioner is required to perform adequately on a regular basis.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The standard air conditioning system relies on five components to create the cool atmosphere: compressor, condenser, thermal expansion valve, evaporator, and receiver drier. Protection of these components from excessive overpressure on the high side, or vacuum on the lower side, is vital. This is normally accomplished by the use of high and low pressure switches. These switches are placed in locations to provide the necessary system safeguards. The high pressure switch on a tractor loader backhoe is generally located somewhere between the outlet of the compressor and the inlet of the receiver drier, and the low pressure switch is generally located at the outlet of the evaporator. The high pressure switch ensures that the compressor will not over pressurize the system, and cause premature failures of the compressor, condenser, and/or refrigerant lines. The low pressure switch ensures that the compressor will not operate with a vacuum inlet condition, which will cause premature failure of the compressor, as well as provide an opportunity to draw outside contamination into the system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Monitoring and the controlling of the air conditioning system can be set up many ways. Most commonly, and the way that was initially in use on the tractor loader backhoe is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This method energizes a normally closed relay with the output directly sent to the compressor. Voltage supplied to the relay, is dependent on the position of the air conditioning thermostat, and the blower switch. In addition, the voltage supplied to the relay is sent in parallel to both the high and low pressure switches. The high and low pressure switches of the system are set to be normally open during normal operating conditions. This maintains pressures less than 400 psi on the high side, and pressures greater than 4 psi on the low side.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When an abnormal operating condition occurs, (pressure drops above or below the switches' operating threshold) either switch will actuate and send a voltage to the electromagnet of the relay, causing the circuit to open. When this occurs, the armature of the relay is latched in the open position, and the compressor will remain off, until the system is manually cycled off and back on.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cab of the loader backhoe sustains a quite high cab heat load, due to the large area of window glass, and the high heat dissipation of the hydraulics and power train. Therefore when there are outside ambient temperatures below 50&#xb0; F., but the sun is shining bright, there will be cases where the air conditioning needs to be used. The thermodynamics of the air conditioning system is such that the cool ambient temperatures will create a greater pressure drop than usual, causing even more reliance on the low pressure switch. In addition to these cool weather conditions, constant internal cab temperature fluctuations caused by operators opening and closing windows/doors, and turning the heat or A/C on and off, will also create a low side pressure drop in the system that may actuate the low pressure switch.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">With the previous system, this can lead to customer dissatisfaction. Every time there is a slight low side pressure drop, the air conditioning relay will latch out, causing the air conditioning system to shut down, and the operator is required to divert his or her attention, and physically turn the A/C system off and back on. These low pressure latch outs are brought to the operator's attention by a warning light on the side console. This is the same warning light that also warms the operator of a high side pressure rise.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, what is sought is a low-pressure cut-out circuit for an air conditioner, which protects the air conditioning system components when subjected to the above low pressure conditions, yet which overcomes shortcomings of the know systems and provides advantages thereover, including avoiding the necessity for manually resetting the system after low pressure cut-out, and providing an ability to better diagnose problems with the system, so as to be more satisfactory when subjected to operating conditions such as described above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">What is disclosed is a cut-out circuit for an air conditioner, which provides advantages of the known systems, including protecting the air conditioning system components when subjected to the above described low pressure conditions, yet which overcomes the disadvantages thereof, including, but not limited to, avoiding the necessity for manually resetting the system after low pressure cut-out, and providing an ability to better diagnose problems with the system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the cut-out circuit includes a device, preferably a relay, connectable to a voltage source and through a normally closed first pressure switch to a compressor clutch, the relay being operable in a closed state to output a voltage from the voltage source through the first pressure switch to the clutch to engage it, and in an open state to cease outputting or interrupting the voltage to disengage it. The first pressure switch is operable to open responsive to a low pressure condition, to interrupt voltage flow to the clutch, to also disengage it. The circuit also includes a normally open second pressure switch connected to the relay and connectable to a voltage source, the second pressure switch being operable to close responsive to a high pressure condition, to output a voltage from a voltage source connected thereto, to the relay for changing the operating state of the relay to the open state, to thereby disengage the clutch. The first pressure switch is preferably a low pressure switch connected to a low pressure side of the air conditioning system. The second pressure switch is preferably a high pressure switch connected to a voltage source and to a high pressure side of the air conditioning system.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another preferred aspect of the invention, the relay is configured to latch in the open state when the voltage from the second pressure switch is outputted thereto. Also preferably, the relay is configured so as to unlatch when a predetermined condition is present, which condition is preferably removal and reapplication of a voltage thereto.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Turning now to the drawings wherein aspects of a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional work machine <b>10</b>, which is a tractor loader backhoe, is shown. Tractor loader backhoe <b>10</b> is contemplated to be representative of a wide variety of work machines with which the present invention can be utilized. Tractor loader backhoe <b>10</b> includes an engine <b>12</b> operable for propelling it over surfaces such as the ground, and for powering a variety of systems thereof, including air conditioning system <b>14</b> for cooling an operator cab <b>16</b> surrounded by large windows <b>18</b>, and apparatus including a backhoe <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, air conditioning system <b>14</b> is controllable by an operator using suitable input devices, which can include, but are not limited to, a blower switch <b>22</b>, also including an on/off switch for system <b>14</b>, and a temperature controller or thermostat <b>24</b>, which can be, for instance, a conventional rotary or linear potentiometer, or the like, both located in cab <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Air conditioning system <b>14</b> includes a compressor clutch <b>26</b>, a high pressure switch <b>28</b>, and a low pressure switch <b>30</b>. Compressor clutch <b>26</b> is controllably engageable to connect a refrigerant compressor <b>32</b> of air conditioning system <b>14</b> with a drive, such as an auxiliary belt drive driven by engine <b>12</b>, for compressing refrigerant of the air conditioning system in the well known manner. The refrigerant will be compressed to a designated high pressure and will flow, as denoted by the arrows (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), along a fluid path through refrigerant lines <b>34</b> which connect to a heat exchanger or condenser <b>36</b> of a high pressure side of system <b>14</b>. Condenser <b>36</b> will typically be located in a rack with other heat exchangers, such as the engine radiator, located in this application near the front end of engine <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Compressor <b>32</b> may be located near this end of the engine also. High pressure switch <b>28</b> is located in a high-pressure side refrigerant line <b>34</b> and is operable for detecting over pressure conditions in the high pressure side of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">From condenser <b>36</b>, the pressurized refrigerant will flow through lines <b>34</b> of the high pressure side to a receiver dryer <b>38</b>, and from there, through an expansion valve <b>40</b>. The refrigerant will exit expansion valve <b>40</b> at a lower pressure, and flow at the lower pressure through a low pressure side of the system to a second heat exchanger or evaporator <b>42</b>, through which cab air is directed by a blower fan <b>44</b> for cooling the interior space of the cab in the well known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">From evaporator <b>42</b>, the lower pressure refrigerant will pass through the low pressure side en route to compressor <b>32</b>, completing a closed loop. Low pressure switch <b>30</b> is located in a low pressure side refrigerant line <b>34</b>, typically at the outlet of evaporator <b>42</b>, and is operable for detecting undesirable and possibly damaging low pressure conditions in the low pressure side of the system, for instance, but not limited to, pressure conditions lower than about 4 pounds per square inch (psi). This ensures that compressor <b>32</b> will not operate with a vacuum inlet condition, which could cause premature failure of the compressor, as well as provide an opportunity to draw outside contamination into the system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a known prior art high and low pressure cut-out circuit <b>46</b> for an air conditioning system, such as system <b>14</b>, used on tractor loader backhoes, is shown. Cut-out circuit <b>46</b> energizes a normally closed relay <b>48</b> which receives a voltage from a voltage source <b>50</b> via switch <b>22</b> and thermostat <b>24</b>, when in operative positions, respectively, over a conductive path <b>52</b>. An armature <b>54</b> of relay <b>48</b> outputs the voltage over a conductive path <b>56</b> to compressor clutch <b>26</b>. Voltage supplied to relay <b>48</b> from voltage source <b>50</b> is also supplied in parallel to both the high and low pressure switches <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>. The high and low pressure switches <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> are set to be normally open during normal operating conditions. This maintains pressures less than a predetermined maximum pressure, here, preferably about 400 psi, on the high side of the fluid circuit, and pressures greater than a predetermined minimum pressure, here, preferably about 4 psi, on the low side.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When an abnormal operating condition occurs, (pressure drops above or below the switches' operating threshold) either switch <b>28</b> or <b>30</b> will actuate and send a voltage over a conductive path <b>58</b> to an electromagnet <b>60</b> of relay <b>48</b>, to cause armature <b>54</b> to move (down in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to open relay <b>48</b> and thus the circuit providing the voltage over conductive path <b>56</b> to clutch <b>26</b>, that is, so as to create an interruption of the voltage flow to clutch <b>26</b>. When this occurs, relay <b>48</b> is preferably configured such that armature <b>54</b> is latched in the lower position, and the compressor will thus remain off, until the system is manually cycled off and back on. This is achieved by cycling switch <b>22</b> off and on again. Also, a voltage is sent via conductive path <b>58</b> to a signal light <b>62</b> in cab <b>16</b>, to indicate a problem.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As explained above under the Background Art heading, cab <b>16</b> of a tractor loader backhoe sustains a quite high cab heat load, due to the large area of windows <b>18</b> surrounding the cab, and the high heat dissipation of the hydraulics and power train of the machine. As a result, it has been found that, when outside ambient temperatures are below about 50&#xb0; F., and the sun is bright, the air conditioning may be switched on. The thermodynamics of an air conditioning system, such as system <b>14</b> illustrated, is that the cool ambient temperatures will often create a greater pressure drop than under other operating conditions, such that low pressure switch <b>30</b> will operate more frequently to cut-out the system. In addition to these cool weather conditions, internal cab temperature fluctuations caused by frequent opening and closing windows/doors, and turning the heat or air conditioning on and off, can also create low side pressure drops in the system to actuate low pressure switch <b>30</b>. With the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each time high or low pressure switch <b>28</b> or <b>30</b> cuts the system out, it must be reset by turning the system off and on again using switch <b>22</b>. And, in the event that it is desired to identify and correct a problem with the system, since the cut-out routine is the same for both the high and low sides of the system, diagnosis of the problem will be more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an improved cut-out circuit <b>64</b> constructed and operable according to the present invention is illustrated, which overcomes one or more problems and shortcomings of prior art circuit <b>46</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In cut-out circuit <b>64</b>, normally closed relay <b>48</b> still receives a voltage from a voltage source <b>50</b> via switch <b>22</b> and thermostat <b>24</b>, when in operative positions, respectively, over a conductive path <b>52</b>. Voltage supplied to relay <b>48</b> from voltage source <b>50</b> is also supplied to high pressure switch <b>28</b>. However, circuit <b>64</b> is different from circuit <b>48</b> in that low pressure switch <b>30</b> is located in conductive path <b>56</b>, between relay <b>48</b> and compressor clutch <b>26</b>, instead of in connection with electromagnet <b>60</b> as in circuit <b>46</b>. This leaves only high pressure switch <b>28</b> in operative control of electromagnet <b>60</b>. High pressure switch <b>28</b> is set again to be normally open during normal operating conditions, but as another difference, low pressure switch <b>30</b> is set to be normally closed. As a result, low pressure switch <b>30</b> directly controls the operation of compressor clutch <b>26</b>, and not the latch out of relay <b>48</b>. In operation, anytime a low side pressure drop below a predetermined minimum pressure, again preferably about 4 psi, is present, low pressure switch <b>30</b> will responsively open the circuit to clutch <b>26</b>, de-activating the compressor. Then, when the pressure in the low side rises again above the predetermined minimum pressure, the circuit to clutch <b>26</b> will be responsively closed and compressor <b>32</b> will be automatically reactivated. When the pressure in the high side rises above a predetermined maximum pressure, again, preferably about 400 psi, relay <b>48</b> will be latched open, as before. Also, when the circuit is opened by switch <b>30</b>, light <b>62</b> is not activated. Thus, as another advantage of the circuit of the present invention, if light <b>62</b> is illuminated, it can only be due to a high pressure problem (i.e., dirty condenser or system restriction). Then if there is ever inadequate cooling, or the compressor is not coming on, it points directly towards a low pressure problem or lack of refrigerant.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Circuit <b>64</b> of the invention thus allows adequate air conditioning functioning during cool ambient temperatures, and the system will still be capable of protecting the compressor from low pressure occurrences, and will still latch out the compressor during high pressure to prevent rapid cycling and failure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be understood that changes in the details, materials, steps, and arrangements of parts which have been described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention will occur to and may be made by those skilled in the art upon a reading of this disclosure within the principles and scope of the invention. The foregoing description illustrates the preferred embodiment of the invention; however, concepts, as based upon the description, may be employed in other embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a vertical outdoor cooker for smoking or otherwise cooking or warming one or more food items in the cooker using smoke and/or heat from a heat source in a base of the cooker, more particularly to an expandable vertical food cooker to which cooking drawers can be added for increased capacity, or removed for decreased capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Outdoor barbecuing is an art form in the South, and apparently in other areas of the country as well. Rabid barbecue fans compete in &#x201c;Best BBQ&#x201d; cook-offs, each claiming to have the tastiest secret recipe barbecue sauces and meat rubs. The food cooker of the present invention is an effective outdoor smoker for barbecuing meats and for cooking various other food items.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Advantages of the vertical food cooker of the present invention include the following: 1) its stacked, tight fitting cooking drawers and generally vertical shape permit high capacity and versatility; 2) its small footprint means that it does not occupy a great deal of floor space on a patio or deck, for example; 3) its removable grill grates are easy to clean and can be removed for accommodating larger cuts of meat or other foods in the cooker. A vertical food cooker that can be expanded or reduced in size as desired is particularly useful for the home or professional chef. Cooking drawers can be added to the expandable vertical food cooker of the present invention for increased capacity, and later removed for decreased cooking capacity, as desired.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following description, like reference characters designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views. Also, in the following description, it is to be understood that such terms as &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;within,&#x201d; and the like are words of convenience and are not to be construed as limiting terms. Referring in more detail to the drawings, the invention will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, a substantially vertical cooker apparatus, or cooker, according to the present invention, generally referred to as <b>10</b> herein, for cooking at least one food item, and preferably a number and variety of meats, vegetables, seafood, and/or other food items outdoors at the same time. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>5</b>, an uppermost, open-bottomed, warming portion <b>11</b> of the vertical cooker <b>10</b> comprises: a support frame <b>12</b>, an openable cooker lid <b>14</b> supported on the upper edge of the support frame <b>12</b>, a grill support device <b>17</b> attached to the support frame <b>12</b>, and a removable grill grate <b>13</b> supported by the grill support device <b>17</b>. The support frame <b>12</b> comprises a substantially cylindrically shaped upper collar <b>15</b>, and at least two, and preferably three, spaced apart rails <b>16</b> extending down in a generally vertical direction from the generally horizontally oriented upper collar <b>15</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The rails <b>16</b> are preferably the same size as one other. An upper end of each rail <b>16</b> is attached to the upper collar <b>15</b>. The grill support device <b>17</b> is preferably attached to the inside wall of the upper collar <b>15</b>, with a removable grill grate <b>13</b> resting on it. The removable grill grate <b>13</b> in the upper warming portion <b>11</b> is bounded by the upper collar <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Continuing with the upper warming portion <b>11</b>, the vertical food cooker <b>10</b> preferably also includes a temperature measuring device with a gauge <b>28</b>. The temperature gauge <b>28</b> is on the upper side wall of the cooker, or in the cooker lid <b>14</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, so that it can be read by a person standing next to the cooker. Maintenance of internal temperature within the cooker <b>10</b> within an appropriate temperature range helps to achieve a properly cooked product and consistent results.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Temperature and smoke inside the cooker <b>10</b> during the cooking process can be controlled in part using one or more adjustable upper air vents <b>26</b> in the cooker <b>10</b>. The adjustable air vents <b>26</b> are in the cooker lid <b>14</b>, or in the upper collar <b>15</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 through 3</figref>. Preferably, an upper vent handle <b>29</b> connected to the upper air vent <b>26</b> or vents is moved (e.g., pushed, turned, or flipped) to close or open the upper air vent <b>26</b>. Opening the upper air vent <b>26</b> permits smoke to exit and outside air to enter, which gradually lowers the internal temperature of the cooker <b>10</b>. Closing the upper air vent <b>26</b> retains the smoke and heat in the cooker, so that food is cooked more thoroughly. Controlling smoke while barbecuing in the cooker is particularly important for achieving a consistent, desirable smokiness in barbecued food.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the uppermost, removable grill grate <b>13</b> is removed from the upper warming portion <b>11</b>, the center space of the cooker <b>10</b> can be accessed. The vertical food cooker <b>10</b> is versatile in that food items can be placed on the uppermost grill grate <b>13</b>, which is supported in the upper warming portion <b>11</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or the uppermost grill grate <b>13</b> can be removed. When the grill grate is removed, a larger food item can be placed in the cooking drawer <b>42</b> below the upper warming portion <b>11</b>, or a meat carcass, such as a whole hog, or the like can be hung from a hook or the like in the large central space of the cooker <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The removable cooker lid <b>14</b> includes a lid handle <b>25</b> affixed to the top of the lid. The lid handle <b>25</b> is used for placing the lid on the cooker <b>10</b> and for removing the lid from the cooker. Alternatively, the cooker lid <b>14</b> may be hinged to the top of the cooker <b>10</b>. A lid lip <b>31</b> on the bottom of the cooker lid <b>14</b> fits closely into the upper edge of the upper collar <b>15</b>. The cooker lid <b>14</b> is dome-shaped, so a larger food item, such as a chicken, can be placed on the uppermost grill grate <b>13</b> for holding and warming. Food can then be served from the uppermost grill grate <b>13</b>, if desired, simply by removing the dome-shaped lid <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Food items that are cooked in the vertical food cooker <b>10</b>, or cooked elsewhere, can be kept warm on the uppermost grill grate <b>13</b> in the spacious upper warming/holding portion <b>11</b> under the cooker lid <b>14</b> while the remaining food cooks below in the cooker <b>10</b>. Some vegetables, such as tomatoes, or other foods that do not require direct heat in order to cook can be placed on the uppermost grill grate <b>13</b> and cooked. Foods like sauces and gravies can be warmed in a pot placed on the uppermost grill grate <b>13</b>. Rolls and other breads, for example, can be warmed on the uppermost grill grate. The food items can be placed on the grill grate before or after the grill grate is placed in the cooker.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, a preferred grill support device <b>17</b> includes a number of spaced apart grate brackets <b>35</b> attached along the inside wall of the upper collar <b>15</b> for supporting the grill grate <b>13</b> in a substantially horizontal position. The grate brackets <b>35</b> are preferably generally L-shaped (in transverse cross-section), the horizontal branch of the &#x201c;L&#x201d; shape being the generally horizontally oriented section and the vertical branch of the &#x201c;L&#x201d; shape being the generally vertically oriented section <b>19</b>. Preferably, the generally vertically oriented section <b>19</b> of each of three or four evenly spaced grate brackets <b>35</b> is attached to the inner side wall of the upper collar, so the grate brackets <b>35</b> occur at a relatively even height about midway down the inside of the upper collar. In the cooker, the removable grill grate <b>13</b> rests on the outwardly extending, generally horizontally oriented section <b>18</b> of each of the spaced apart grate brackets <b>35</b>. Each grate bracket preferably extends out about &#xbd; inch to about one inch into the central space from the inside wall around the inner periphery of the upper collar. The uppermost grill grate <b>13</b> extends substantially horizontally across the cylindrical space bounded by the upper collar <b>15</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The vertical food cooker <b>10</b> also includes a mid portion <b>40</b> between the upper warming portion <b>11</b> and a base portion <b>30</b> of the cooker. The cooker mid portion <b>40</b> includes between about one and about six substantially cylindrically shaped, open-bottomed, openable cooking drawers <b>42</b>, and at least one generally vertical rail <b>16</b> adjacent the cooking drawers. The cooker <b>10</b> more preferably includes between two and five, most preferably three or four, of the cooking drawers <b>42</b>. The generally cylindrically shaped cooking drawers <b>42</b> preferably have the same diameter at the base as one another. Their width may vary. The cooking drawers <b>42</b> are stacked substantially vertically on (i.e., on top of) one another one another. The bottommost cooking drawer <b>42</b><i>c </i>is above the cooker base portion <b>30</b>, any second, midlevel drawer <b>42</b><i>a </i>is directly above the bottommost drawer <b>42</b><i>c</i>, and so forth, with the uppermost drawer <b>42</b> fitting under the upper warming portion <b>11</b>. The cooking drawers <b>42</b> fit closely into the cooker <b>10</b>, so that the heat and smoke are unlikely to seep out between the cooking drawers. Each cooking drawer <b>42</b> includes a grill support device <b>17</b> on an inside wall of the cooking drawer. Each of the substantially horizontally oriented cooking drawers <b>42</b> supports one of the generally circular-shaped, removable grill grates <b>13</b>, with each grill grate being surrounded by the inside wall of each cooking drawer. Each cooking drawer <b>42</b> extends across the cooker from one side to the other, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The cooking drawers <b>42</b> need not have the same height as one another, though they are preferably similarly shaped as seen in the three drawer cooker <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, and the two drawer cooker <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A large quantity of meat can be cooked in the heavy duty cooker <b>10</b>. In a preferred three drawer, four or five foot tall cooker, for example, approximately 100 pounds of meat can be cooked at once. The cooker <b>10</b> can also be used indoors. For example, a three or four drawer cooker <b>10</b> can be placed in a restaurant kitchen under a hood and used to cook for many customers.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The rails <b>16</b> provide support for the vertical food cooker <b>10</b>. At its upper end, the rail <b>16</b> is preferably bolted attached to the outside of the upper collar <b>15</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. At its lower end, the rail <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is inserted in, and may be bolted inside, a lower attachment section <b>32</b> of the cooker base portion <b>30</b>. The lower end of the rail <b>16</b> contacts an upper end of the lower attachment section <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, a rear skin <b>45</b> of the cooker <b>10</b> extends across the back of the cooker <b>10</b> between two rails <b>16</b> on opposite sides of the cooker. The rear skin <b>45</b> is ordinarily visible from the rear of the cooker, while the cooking drawers <b>42</b> can be seen from the front of the cooker <b>10</b>. The outside surface of the rear skin <b>45</b> is preferably adjacent the inside surface of the rails <b>16</b>, with an opposite side edge <b>23</b> of the rear skin <b>45</b> under each of the two opposite rails <b>16</b>, <b>16</b><i>a</i>. When the cooking drawers <b>42</b> are closed, a rear of each cooking drawer <b>42</b> is adjacent the inside surface of the rear skin <b>45</b>. The rear skin <b>45</b> extends behind, but not in front of, the cooking drawers <b>42</b>, and prevents heat and smoke from escaping from the rear of the cooker <b>10</b>. The rear skin <b>45</b> is preferably substantially rectangular in shape and made of stainless steel for durability.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The versatile vertical food cooker <b>10</b> can optionally be used with a varying number of grill grates <b>13</b>, or none at all, as dictated by the size of the food item to be cooked and/or the desired level of cooking. The cooker lid <b>14</b> and uppermost grill grate <b>13</b> can be removed to access the cooker through the top of the cooker rather than using the drawers <b>42</b>. Alternatively, a grill grate <b>13</b> (or two) can be removed from a position between two other grill grates <b>42</b> in order to accommodate a large food item, such as a turkey or chicken that will be cooked in a generally horizontal position (breast up).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The varying distances of the removable grill grates <b>13</b> and the substantially vertically stacked drawers <b>42</b> from the heat source in the burn chamber <b>36</b> allow a variety of meats, vegetables, and/or other food items to be cooked in the cooker <b>10</b>, all at the same time or at graduated times. Skillful spacing of food items and planning ahead permit preparation of an entire meal for many guests or for just a few guests in the present cooker <b>10</b>. The vertically stacked drawers <b>42</b> and grill grates <b>13</b> furnish a substantial amount of grill space, even though the footprint of the generally cylindrical shaped cooker <b>10</b> (on the ground) is small. Each cooking drawer <b>42</b> opens independently, which is convenient for placing the food items on the grill grate <b>13</b>, checking, basting, or topping the food items in the drawer, and removing particular cooked food items from the cooking drawer. The cooker <b>10</b> employs these several cooking drawers <b>42</b> instead of a single door. It is believed that opening a cooking drawer permits much less steam and/or heat to escape than would opening a single, long door.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Racks may be employed in the versatile cooker <b>10</b> to support meat ribs in a vertical position for more thorough cooking of a large number of meat ribs, if desired. Different types of food items can be segregated in the cooker <b>10</b>. For example, one type of meat (e.g., pork) can be segregated in a different cooking drawer <b>42</b> from another type of meat (e.g., beef). Similar types and cuts of meat can be cooked in different cooking drawers, if desired, to suit guests with different cooking level preferences, i.e., meat can be cooked &#x201c;rare&#x201d; in an upper cooking drawer <b>42</b>, while at the same time the same type of meat can be cooked in a lower drawer <b>42</b><i>c </i>for those guests who prefer their meat &#x201c;well done&#x201d;. In such a case, the guests can nevertheless all be served at once. If desired, cuts of meat can be seared on the lowest grill grate <b>13</b>, and then moved up higher in the cooker <b>10</b> (e.g., on an upper drawer grate) for finishing. A user may chose to remove the cooker lid <b>14</b> and use only the uppermost grill grate <b>13</b> like a grill, without using the cooking drawers.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The verticality of the cooker <b>10</b> makes use of the natural tendency of heat to rise, so cooking is efficient. Smoke and heat proceed from the heat source in the burn chamber <b>36</b> up through the cooking drawers <b>42</b> and the upper warming portion <b>11</b>. During cooking, drippings from meat cooking on a higher grate <b>13</b> may drip down onto and baste meat on a lower grate <b>13</b> in the cooker <b>10</b>. After cooking, the user can open the cooking drawers <b>42</b> and/or cooker lid <b>14</b>, remove the grill grates <b>13</b>, and clean them. The user can also remove and clean the cooker lid <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each cooking drawer <b>42</b> includes a drawer cutout <b>44</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>. With the drawer cutout <b>44</b> at the rear of the cooking drawer, the height of the rear <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the drawer is between about &#xbc; and about &#xbd;, most preferably about &#x2153;, the height of the front <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the cooking drawer <b>42</b>. It has been found that the drawer cutout <b>44</b> and this height ratio of the drawer rear <b>42</b><i>b </i>to the drawer front <b>42</b><i>a </i>permits heat and smoke to circulate behind the cooking drawer <b>42</b> so meat or other food items in the drawer are evenly cooked, while preventing air from escaping through the higher drawer front <b>42</b><i>a. </i>The tall front <b>42</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) helps to retains heat when the cooking drawer <b>42</b> is opened and then closed. The heat and smoke circulate in the small space between the rear of the cooking drawers <b>42</b> and the inside of the rear skin <b>45</b>. For example, if the drawer front <b>42</b><i>a </i>is about six (or seven) inches in height, the same drawer at its rear <b>42</b><i>b </i>will be about two inches in height. It has been found herein that a two inch or so rear drawer height is sufficient to hold a grill grate <b>13</b>, even with food loaded on it.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The cooker <b>10</b> holds a number of the generally circular-shaped grill grates <b>13</b>, preferably three or four same sized grill grates, including at least one grill grate for each cooking drawer (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>). Grill grates <b>13</b> are most preferably between about 16 and about 20, most preferably about 18 inches in circumference to correspond with the most preferred size of cooking drawer <b>42</b> at its open bottom. The grill grate <b>13</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> includes spaced apart, substantially parallel grate ribs <b>34</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the ends of the grate ribs <b>34</b> are attached to a ring-shaped grill grate base <b>48</b> around the circumference of the grill grate <b>13</b>. The grill grates <b>13</b> can be made of stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each cooking drawer <b>42</b> supports one removable grill grate <b>13</b>. When in place in the cooker <b>10</b>, each grill grate <b>13</b> extends across the bottom of the otherwise bottomless drawer <b>42</b>. Smoke and heat pass up through the spaces between the grate ribs <b>34</b> from the burn chamber <b>36</b> below and cook food on the grill grates <b>13</b>, or in the cooker <b>10</b> while it is in use.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Grill grates <b>13</b> are placed on grill support devices <b>17</b> in the upper warming portion <b>11</b>, and/or the cooking drawers <b>42</b>, as desired. The vertical food cooker <b>10</b> can also be used without grill grates. When all the grill grates <b>13</b> are in place in the cooker <b>10</b>, they are substantially parallel to one another. The grill grate <b>13</b> in the upper warming portion <b>11</b> is above, and spaced apart from, the spaced apart grill grates <b>13</b> in the cooking drawers <b>42</b>. The upper warming portion <b>11</b> is above the vertically stacked cooking drawers, and the cooking drawers <b>42</b> are above the burn chamber <b>36</b>. Thus, the cooker <b>10</b> is &#x201c;vertical&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The substantially vertical food cooker <b>10</b> includes the cooker base portion <b>30</b>, which is beneath the mid portion <b>40</b>, which is beneath the upper warming portion <b>11</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the base portion <b>30</b> of the cooker <b>10</b> includes a substantially cylindrically shaped burn chamber <b>36</b> and a substantially planar and circular-shaped fire pan <b>70</b>. The fire pan <b>70</b> includes a number of spaced apart fire pan apertures <b>71</b>. The burn chamber <b>36</b> is bottomless when the fire pan <b>70</b> is removed for cleaning. The fire pan should only be removed after cooker <b>10</b> is completely cooled off. When the cooker lid is off, the empty cooker <b>10</b> can be flushed using a hose, if desired. The fire pan can be removed by opening the cooking drawer or drawers <b>42</b>, inserting a hook or hangar device through some of the fire pan apertures <b>71</b>, and lifting the fire pan <b>70</b> out.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Food items on the grill grates <b>13</b> are cooked by heat and/or steam within the closed cooker. The heat and smoke are emitted from a charcoal fire or other heat source on the fire pan <b>70</b>. Ash from fires built on the fire pan <b>70</b> falls through the fire pan apertures <b>71</b>, preferably to a fire-proof container that has been placed on the ground under the cooker.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The fire pan <b>70</b> is preferably supported on lower brackets <b>37</b><i>b</i>, which are seen in hidden line beneath the fire pan <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The base portion <b>30</b> preferably includes two sets of three or four lower support brackets <b>35</b>, <b>37</b>, one set above the other. The lowest set of support brackets <b>37</b> supports the fire pan <b>70</b>, and the set of brackets <b>35</b> above it on the inside wall of the cooker supports a lowermost grill grate <b>13</b>, if desired. The brackets <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> within a vertical food cooker <b>10</b> can be identical to one another, or different from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The grate brackets <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> are preferably generally L-shaped in transverse cross-section, the horizontal branch of the &#x201c;L&#x201d; shape being the generally horizontally oriented section and the vertical branch of the &#x201c;L&#x201d; shape being the generally vertically oriented section <b>19</b>. Preferably, the generally vertically oriented section <b>19</b> of each of three or four evenly spaced, same sized grate brackets <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> is attached to the inner side wall, so the grate brackets <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> occur at a relatively even height about midway down the wall of that portion or cooking drawer. The removable grill grate <b>13</b>, or fire pan <b>70</b>, rests on, or contacts, the outwardly extending, generally horizontally oriented section <b>18</b> of each of the spaced apart grate brackets <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> while the cooker <b>10</b> is in use. The low profile, generally horizontally oriented sections <b>18</b> preferably extend out about &#xbc; inch to about one inch into the central space from the inside wall around the inner periphery of each portion or drawer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A removable, fire proof bowl can optionally be placed on the lowermost grill grate <b>13</b>, which may be in the base portion <b>30</b> or in the lowermost cooking drawer <b>42</b><i>c</i>. The fire proof bowl preferably holds wet chips of a preferred wood, such as hickory, oak, apple, cherry, or peach wood. Smoke from the wood chips imparts a special flavor to the food items being cooked above them in the cooker <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the fire proof bowl can be partially filled with water. The heat from the fire below the bowl boils the water in the bowl, forming steam that can be used to cook food items, such as oysters, in the cooking drawer <b>42</b> or drawers above the steam bowl. Alternatively, pieces of lemons or oranges, apple juice, beer, or liquid smoke can be placed in the bowl for flavoring meat cooking above it. The word &#x201c;cooker&#x201d; herein is meant to include &#x201c;smoker&#x201d;, since smoking also cooks the meat or other food being cooked. The cooker <b>10</b> is often used for smoking, or barbecuing, various cuts of meat.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Importantly, the base portion <b>30</b> further includes an adjustable base damper <b>36</b> in a side wall of the burn chamber <b>36</b>. The damper <b>38</b> (draft) is opened or closed partially or fully as a means of controlling the amount of burn in the burn chamber <b>36</b> while the cooker <b>10</b> is in use. To use a preferred damper herein, the user grasps a damper handle <b>43</b> on the damper <b>36</b> and moves it to slide fan-shaped segments of the damper <b>38</b> open or closed. Controlling draft with the damper <b>38</b> controls the burn rate and direct heat temperature in the cooker, as well as the smoke emission rate. By coordinating the opening and closing of the upper air vent <b>26</b> and the base damper <b>38</b>, the user can control cooking time and temperature, as well as meat flavor through smoke control. For example, if the user determines that the interior temperature according to the temperature gauge <b>28</b> is too hot, the damper <b>38</b> can be closed partway, and the upper air vent <b>26</b> can be opened to dissipate some of the interior heat. Closing both is believed to deprive the charcoal of air, which causes the fire to go out and eventually halts the cooking process. Once food in the cooker <b>10</b> has cooked sufficiently, the damper <b>38</b> can be closed to cause the cooking process to slow and then stop.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The base portion <b>30</b> further includes at least three, and preferably four, support legs <b>50</b> for supporting the rest of the cooker <b>10</b>. The upper end of each support leg <b>50</b> is attached to a bottom section of the base portion <b>30</b>. The cooker <b>10</b> is preferably placed on a relatively flat surface. The support legs <b>50</b> are preferably not angled widely away from the base portion <b>30</b>, so that they do not pose a tripping hazard and so the cooker footprint is kept small.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the substantially vertical cooker <b>10</b> includes a drawer opening and closing mechanism <b>55</b>. This allows a user to independently open each cooking drawer <b>42</b> wide enough to place the meat or other food items on the grill grate <b>13</b>, but not so wide that a loaded drawer might break over time. The drawer opening/closing mechanism <b>55</b> includes a hinge pin <b>56</b>, which is enclosed in a hinge pin channel <b>57</b> on an inside wall of each cooking drawer <b>42</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The hinge pin can be an oil-free bearing. The cooking drawer <b>42</b> pivots on the hinge pin <b>56</b> when the drawer is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the cooking drawer <b>42</b> is opened (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to its maximum acceptable position, the outside of the drawer strikes the closest rail <b>16</b><i>a</i>, which is on the outside of the cooker. The stop rail <b>16</b><i>a </i>is a sufficient number of inches away from the hinge pin <b>56</b> to cause this to happen. The preferred distance between the hinge pin <b>56</b> and the stop/nearest rail <b>16</b><i>a </i>is about &#xbd; the distance between the nearest rail <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the rail <b>16</b> on the opposite side of the cooker <b>10</b>, which neighbors the stop rail. When the cooking drawer <b>42</b> strikes the stop rail <b>16</b><i>a</i>, continued forward motion of the drawer is stopped and the drawer is prevented from swinging all the way out. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the stop rail <b>16</b><i>a </i>is on the right side of the cooker <b>10</b> as the cooker is viewed from the front, while the drawer handles <b>59</b> are on the left of the cooker as it is viewed from the front. Since the stop rail <b>16</b> is generally vertically oriented, and each stacked drawer <b>42</b> opens in a generally horizontal direction, each drawer will strike the same stop rail <b>16</b><i>a </i>as it swings open.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The drawer opening/closing mechanism <b>55</b> also includes a drawer handle and latch mechanism <b>58</b> on the side of each cooking drawer <b>42</b> opposite the hinge pin <b>56</b>. While the hinge pin <b>56</b> is adjacent the stop rail <b>16</b><i>a </i>on one side of the cooker <b>10</b>, the drawer handle and latch mechanism <b>58</b> is adjacent the rail <b>16</b> on the other side of the cooker, so the cooking drawer slides open from between the two front rails. The drawer handle and latch mechanism <b>58</b> includes a drawer handle <b>59</b> and a drawer latch <b>60</b>. The drawer handle <b>59</b> is preferably made of a material that does not retain heat, such as wood. The rail <b>16</b> adjacent the drawer handle and latch mechanism <b>58</b> includes spaced-apart rail knobs <b>64</b> on the outside of the rail, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The drawer latch <b>60</b> includes a spring-loaded ball <b>61</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The location of each spring-loaded ball <b>61</b> of a drawer latch <b>60</b> corresponds to the location of a rail knob <b>64</b> on the adjacent rail, so each spring-loaded ball <b>61</b> contacts a rail knob <b>64</b> when the drawer <b>42</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the drawer handle <b>59</b> is lightly pulled, tension is released and the drawer latch <b>60</b> opens. This causes the spring loaded ball <b>61</b> to push out, which releases the tension and unlatches the drawer <b>42</b>, allowing it to swing open. After use, the cooking drawer <b>42</b> is swung closed, and the latch <b>60</b> latches. The tension in the spring behind the ball <b>61</b> retains the cooking drawer in the closed position until it is opened again. The drawers <b>42</b> open independently of one another, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The drawer handle and latch mechanism <b>58</b> permits each drawer <b>42</b> to be opened with one hand, leaving the user's other hand free for other tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, the vertical food cooker <b>10</b> includes: 1) substantially cylindrical cooking drawers <b>42</b> that open independently for fuel efficiency and segregation of food items; 2) rails <b>16</b> for supporting the cooking drawers <b>42</b> and cooker <b>10</b> and for stopping cooking drawers as they are opened; and 3) the hinge pin <b>56</b> and efficient drawer handle and latch mechanism <b>58</b> for smoothly and independently opening the cooking drawers <b>42</b>; 4) the grill grates <b>13</b> are removable for versatility in using the central space of the cooker <b>10</b>; and 5) the grate lips <b>67</b> are sufficiently sturdy to support loaded grill grates <b>13</b>, but have a low profile for those occasions when one or more grill grates <b>13</b> are removed to accommodate larger food item(s) in the central space of the cooker <b>10</b>. Other than the vent <b>26</b> and damper <b>38</b>, there are no other openings to the outside when the cooking drawers <b>42</b> are closed. This enables steam and heat to build up and be steadily maintained in the cooker <b>10</b> when it is in use.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The substantially cylindrical-shaped cooker <b>10</b> does not have a door. Instead of opening a door to a compartment, the entire cooking drawer swivels out, displaying any food items in the drawer. The side walls of the cooking drawer enclose and support the grill grate. The grill grate support device is not a sideways drawer channel as is found on the opposite long sides of a conventional kitchen-type drawer. There is therefore no struggle to seat guides on the long sides of the conventional drawer into such sideways channels. The grill grates <b>13</b> are simply dropped down onto the grate brackets <b>35</b> from above once the particular cooking drawer <b>42</b> swivels open, or in the case of the uppermost grill grate <b>13</b>, when the cooking lid <b>14</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 8</figref> show an expandable vertical food cooker <b>10</b>. The vertical food cooker <b>10</b> is partly detachable so that it can be expanded for cooking more food. The user can choose to partially disassemble the base unit cooker <b>72</b> and then add a cooking drawer or two, as needed. For everyday use, for example, the user might choose to employ a one or two drawer base unit cooker <b>72</b>. Then, for a party or the like, the user can increase the capacity of the cooker using a one or two cooking drawer add-on kit <b>73</b>. The user can purchase both the base unit cooker <b>72</b> and an add on kit <b>73</b> at the outset, or the user can purchase a base unit cooker <b>72</b> at the outset and build onto it in a year or two by purchasing an add-on kit or two to meet greater demand in the household or commercial kitchen (e.g., to serve additional family members or guests).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the cooker add-on kit <b>73</b> for the expandable vertical food cooker comprises: a cooking drawer <b>42</b>, a grill grate <b>13</b>, and a second rear skin <b>45</b><i>b</i>: (a) a support frame <b>12</b><i>b</i>, a grill support device <b>17</b> being attached to the support frame <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the support frame <b>12</b><i>b </i>comprising a substantially cylindrical-shaped upper collar <b>15</b> and at least two, and preferably three, spaced apart rails <b>16</b> attached to and extending generally downward from the upper collar <b>15</b>; (b) one or more cylindrically shaped, open-bottomed cooking drawers <b>42</b>, each cooking drawers <b>42</b> comprising a grill support device <b>17</b> on an inside wall of the cooking drawer <b>42</b>, each cooking drawer <b>42</b> comprising the substantially vertically oriented hinge pin channel <b>57</b> on a wall of the cooking drawer <b>42</b>, the hinge pin channel <b>57</b> supporting a hinge pin <b>56</b> within the hinge pin channel <b>57</b>, an end of the hinge pin <b>56</b> protruding from the hinge pin channel <b>57</b>; (c) one or more removable grill grates <b>13</b> supportable on the grill support device <b>17</b>, and (d) a cooker rear skin <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A two drawer add-on kit <b>73</b> comprises a taller support frame <b>12</b><i>b </i>than a one drawer add-on kit, two cooking drawers <b>42</b>, two removable grill grates <b>13</b>, and a third, wider rear skin <b>45</b><i>b </i>that is wider than the rear skin of the one drawer add-on kit. The base unit cooker <b>72</b>, which may include between about one and five cooking drawers <b>42</b>, is as described hereinabove. A two drawer base unit cooker <b>72</b>, for example, corresponds to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The add-on kit support frame <b>12</b><i>b </i>is taller (i.e., the rails are longer) than the base unit support frame <b>12</b> because more cooking drawers <b>42</b> are being added to expand the cooker unit. Since the kit support frame <b>12</b><i>b </i>must also accommodate the base unit cooking drawers <b>42</b>, the length of the rails <b>16</b> of the kit support frame <b>12</b><i>b </i>exceeds the collective height of the cooking drawers <b>42</b> in the kit.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">To add cooking drawers using the cooker add-on kit <b>73</b>, the grill grates <b>13</b> and the cooker lid <b>14</b> are removed from the base unit cooker <b>72</b>. The base unit support frame <b>12</b> is then removed by pulling it upward. The ends of the three rails <b>16</b> of the support frame <b>12</b> are pulled out of the three corresponding holes <b>74</b> in the rail attachment sections <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The lowermost cooking drawer <b>42</b><i>c </i>is then stacked on the upper edge of the burn chamber <b>36</b>. The lower end of the hinge pin <b>56</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) fits into the hinge pin channel hole <b>57</b><i>b </i>in the lower end of the hinge pin channel (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The cooking drawers <b>42</b> of the add-on kit <b>73</b> are interchangeable with the drawers <b>42</b> of the base cooker unit <b>72</b>, so the cooking drawers can be placed in any order in the expanded cooker unit. The second cooking drawer <b>42</b> is then placed on the top of the first, lowermost cooking drawer <b>42</b><i>c</i>. The lower end of the hinge pin <b>56</b> of the cooking drawer above fits into the upper end of the hinge pin channel <b>57</b> of the cooking drawer below. Third, fourth, and fifth cooking drawers <b>42</b>, as desired, are stacked in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The add-on kit rear skin <b>45</b><i>b </i>is then placed over the outside of the cooking drawers <b>42</b> in the rear of the cooker. The rear skin <b>45</b><i>b </i>is wide enough to cover all of the cooking drawers. Although the add-on kit rear skins <b>45</b><i>b</i>, c vary in width to accommodate different numbers of cooking drawers <b>42</b> (from between two and six drawers), they are the same length as one another and as the base unit rear skin, so that they extend between the two opposite rails <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The add-on kit support frame <b>12</b> is then placed on the uppermost cooking drawer <b>42</b>, with a protrusion <b>75</b> on the lower edge of the upper collar <b>15</b> of the add-on kit support frame fitting into the upper end of the hinge pin channel <b>57</b> of the uppermost cooking drawer <b>42</b>. The lower edge of the upper collar <b>15</b> lies along the upper edge of the uppermost cooking drawer. The protrusion <b>75</b> is the same size as the end of the hinge pin, so that it fits closely into the hinge pin channel of the uppermost cooking drawer <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Alternatively, the hinge pin <b>56</b> extends up from the top of the hinge pin channel <b>57</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in each cooking drawer <b>42</b>, instead of from the bottom of the hinge pin channel. In this alternative, the base portion <b>30</b> of the cooker base unit <b>72</b> includes a protrusion <b>75</b><i>b </i>as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, which is like the hinge pin channel protrusion <b>75</b> from the upper collar <b>15</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, except that the lower protrusion <b>75</b><i>b </i>extends up from an edge of the base portion <b>30</b> adjacent the rail <b>16</b><i>a</i>. Also in this expandable cooker <b>10</b>, the end of the hinge pin channel with its hole <b>57</b><i>b </i>for receiving the end of the hinge pin <b>56</b> is inverted on the upper collar <b>15</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, rather than on the base portion <b>30</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In the cooker add-on kit <b>73</b> and cooker base portion <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, respectively, when the lower edge of the upper collar <b>15</b> is placed on the upper edge of the uppermost cooking drawer <b>42</b>, the top of the hinge pin <b>56</b> on the drawer extends into the hinge pin hole <b>57</b><i>b </i>on the upper collar <b>15</b>. In both cases, the hinge pin channel protrusion <b>75</b> and hinge pin hole <b>57</b><i>b </i>are substantially aligned with one another at opposite ends of the hinge pin channel <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The rails <b>16</b>, which extend down from the upper collar <b>15</b>, slide over the outside walls of the cooking drawers <b>42</b> when the support frame is added to the cooker during assembly. The stop rail <b>16</b><i>a </i>lies alongside the hinge pin channel <b>57</b> on the stacked cooking drawers <b>42</b>. The two opposite rails <b>16</b>, <b>16</b><i>a </i>also extend over the opposite side edges <b>23</b> of the rear skin <b>45</b>. The length of the rear skin <b>45</b> therefore approximates the distance between the two opposite rails <b>16</b>, <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The lower ends of the rails <b>16</b> are inserted into the corresponding holes <b>74</b> in the rail attachment sections <b>32</b> of the base unit cooker's base portion <b>30</b>. The hinge pins are preferably oil free bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The grill grates <b>13</b> and the cooker lid <b>14</b> are replaced on the expanded cooker unit, which is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The drawer handles <b>59</b> are preferably simple wooden handles attached to the side of each cooking drawer. The drawer handles are preferably stacked above one other as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Thus, the expandable vertical food cooker <b>10</b> includes: (a) an open-bottomed upper warming portion <b>11</b> comprising: a removable support frame <b>12</b>, a grill support device <b>17</b> attached to the support frame <b>12</b>, an adjustable upper air vent <b>26</b>, and an openable cooker lid <b>14</b> on top of the cooker, the support frame <b>12</b> comprising a substantially cylindrical-shaped upper collar <b>15</b> and at least two spaced apart rails <b>16</b> extending generally downwardly from the upper collar <b>15</b>; (b) a cooker base portion <b>30</b> beneath the upper warming portion <b>11</b>, the base portion <b>30</b> comprising: a substantially cylindrically shaped burn chamber <b>36</b>, an adjustable base damper <b>38</b> in the burn chamber <b>36</b>, a grill support device <b>17</b> in the burn chamber <b>36</b>, a substantially planar fire pan <b>70</b> at a bottom of the burn chamber <b>36</b>, and at least three support legs <b>50</b> on the bottom of the cooker <b>10</b>; (c) a cooker mid portion <b>40</b> between the upper warming portion <b>11</b> and the base portion <b>30</b>, the mid portion <b>40</b> comprising between about one and about six substantially cylindrically shaped, open-bottomed, stackable cooking drawers <b>42</b>, as described herein; and (d) one or more removable grill grates <b>13</b>,each of which is supportable on one of the grill grate devices <b>17</b>. The grill grate device <b>17</b> is preferably a set of grate brackets <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Each of the independently openable cooking drawers <b>42</b> in the expanded cooker <b>10</b> comprises a grill support device <b>17</b> within the cooking drawer <b>42</b>. The cooking drawers <b>42</b> are detachable from one another and interchangeable with one another. Each of the cooking drawers <b>42</b> includes the substantially vertically oriented hinge pin channel <b>57</b> on the cooking drawer <b>42</b>, and a substantially vertically oriented hinge pin <b>56</b> within the hinge pin channel <b>57</b>, as described herein. An end of the hinge pin <b>56</b> protrudes from the top or bottom of the hinge pin channel <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The expandable vertical food cooker <b>10</b> further includes a removable rear skin <b>45</b> at a rear of the cooker extending behind/outside the cooking drawers <b>42</b> and inside the rails <b>16</b>. The length of the rear skin <b>45</b> is preferably about the same as a distance between the two rails <b>16</b>, and a width of the rear skin <b>45</b> is about equal to a height of the cooking drawers <b>42</b> stacked in the cooker.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the expandable cooker <b>10</b>, the cooker base portion <b>30</b> and the upper collar <b>15</b> each comprise either a hinge pin hole <b>57</b><i>b</i>, or a protrusion <b>75</b> insertable in the corresponding hinge pin channel <b>57</b> of an adjacent one of the cooking drawers, the end of the hinge pin <b>56</b> being insertable in the hinge pin hole <b>57</b><i>b</i>. Each expandable cooker has both the hinge pin channel protrusion <b>75</b> and a hinge pin hole <b>57</b><i>b</i>, which are normally aligned. When the expanded cooker <b>10</b> is assembled, the hinge pin channels <b>57</b> on the cooking drawers <b>42</b> are aligned, and the hinge pin channel protrusion <b>75</b> and hinge pin hole <b>57</b><i>b </i>are aligned at either end of the whole hinge pin channel <b>57</b>. The stop rail <b>16</b><i>a </i>ordinarily is adjacent the hinge pin channel <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The base unit support frame <b>12</b> and rear skin <b>45</b> are stored and used later when and if the user wishes to reduce capacity of the vertical food cooker <b>10</b>. The steps outlined herein are also followed to reduce capacity, except that fewer cooking drawers <b>42</b> are put back into the cooker unit <b>10</b>. When capacity is reduced, the base unit support frame <b>12</b>, which has rails <b>16</b> that are shorter in length, and the shorter base unit rear skin <b>45</b> are used in place of the taller add-on kit support frame <b>12</b><i>b </i>and wider add-on kit rear skin <b>45</b><i>b</i>, which are stored for later use.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/740,758 filed Nov. 30, 2005. All of the subject matter of that provisional application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to wastewater treatment systems and the construction to compensate for headloss migration in a wastewater treatment system using ceramic elements and membrane diffusers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional wastewater treatment plant typically involves aeration. One type of aeration device is a fine bubble diffuser. The most common types of fine bubble diffusers are ceramic elements and rubber membrane diffusers. In some wastewater treatment systems, the systems specify the use of both ceramic element diffusers and rubber membrane diffusers in the same system. For example, ceramic elements may be installed throughout most of the treatment tanks in the wastewater treatment system and with the use of rubber membrane diffusers installed in the remainder of the system. In such wastewater treatment systems, the rubber membrane diffusers and the ceramic elements are not mounted on any single header but are instead installed on separate grids of headers. However, both sets of grids of headers share the same air supply. In some applications, valves cannot be used to balance the air flow between the grid supporting the ceramic element diffusers and the grid supporting the rubber membrane diffusers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known from testing that operating the diffusers for long periods of time results in headloss rise or &#x201c;headloss migration&#x201d; due to a change in the relative resistance to air flow through the fine bubble diffusers caused primarily by either biofouling and/or changes in water absorption of the diffuser elements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the design of a wastewater system it is difficult to design membrane and ceramic element diffusers to have identical headloss versus air flow curves. Additionally, it is also difficult to maintain the headloss from element to element within manufacturing control limits and to influence or predict the different rates of headloss migration arising as a result of fouling of the diffuser elements and changes in surface properties of the rubber membrane diffusers. It is also difficult to predict the changes over time of the flow volume into the wastewater treatment system and the operating flow rates of wastewater treated by the system as additional demands are placed on the system by growth of a community.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When two types of diffusers such as ceramic diffusers and rubber membrane diffusers are installed on headers or grids connected to the same air supply system, the less restrictive elements produce higher air flows. Even if balancing orifices are used to compensate for air flow between the header pipes into the diffuser elements, the balancing orifices have a non-linear headloss versus air flow curve, and that non-linear headloss versus air flow curve is significantly different than the headloss/air flow curve of the diffuser elements. Because the headloss/air flow curve of a ceramic diffuser element does not match the headloss/air flow curve of a rubber membrane diffuser, changes in air flow through the headers can only truly be balanced at one flow rate. Additionally, different rates of headloss migration over time complicate the situation further. If the migration rates are significantly different, which is usually the case between ceramic diffusers and rubber membrane diffusers, the balanced flow point will shift with time to a different system flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">All of these factors prevent the engineer designing a system that may be balanced at initiation of operation of the wastewater treatment system to maintain its balance over the life of the system's operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention involves installing provision to allow headers supporting one type of fine bubble diffuser element to be raised or lowered as needed and whenever an imbalance occurs, relative to headers supporting a second type of diffuser element.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">If the two characteristic headloss/air flow curves of the diffuser elements are such that both share the same shape and slope, but one is shifted higher than the other by an inch of water, then reducing the elevation of the header with the more restrictive membranes by the same amount will compensate for the difference.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This approach is feasible because the flow imbalance through the diffuser elements is very sensitive to small differences in headloss. Therefore, it does not take much vertical correction in the position of the grid to bring the two types of grid elements into flow balance. Only a few inches of relative submersion difference is normally required to correct for the imbalance. If the characteristic headloss/air flow curves of the two types of elements have the same slope, then the resulting correction in elevation of the diffuser elements will result in substantially balanced flow distribution over a wide range of flow.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a wastewater treatment system <b>10</b> including an activated sludge tank <b>12</b> and a clarifier <b>14</b>. Influent wastewater flows through supply <b>16</b> into the activated sludge tank <b>12</b> wherein the wastewater is treated. The activated sludge tank <b>12</b> will include several compartments or zones <b>18</b>. The tank <b>12</b> further includes a plurality of air diffusers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> mounted near the bottom <b>24</b> of the tank and intended to diffuse air in the form of small bubbles into the wastewater <b>26</b> in the tank <b>12</b>. The air diffusers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are mounted on headers <b>28</b> and the headers <b>28</b> are connected to an air supply pipe <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One of the headers <b>28</b> is shown more particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at least one of the headers <b>28</b> includes a horizontally extending pipe <b>31</b> supported near the bottom <b>24</b> or the floor of the wastewater treatment tank <b>12</b>. The horizontally extending pipe <b>31</b> supports a plurality of air diffuser elements <b>20</b> such that air or other gas can be discharged from the horizontally extending pipe <b>31</b> through the diffuser elements <b>20</b> and into the wastewater <b>26</b> in the form of fine bubbles <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The diffusers elements <b>20</b> can be any type of diffuser element for the type used in wastewater treatment and including ceramic diffusers and rubber membrane diffusers.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The horizontally extending pipe <b>31</b> is connected to an air supply pipe <b>30</b> which is in turn connected to a source of air pressure (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the header <b>28</b> is connected to the vertically extending air supply pipe <b>30</b> by an elbow joint pipe <b>38</b>, the elbow joint pipe <b>38</b> having an end <b>40</b> pivotally connected to the lower end of the vertical pipe <b>30</b> and a second end <b>42</b> pivotally connected to an end of the pipe <b>31</b>. The joined sections of pipe can pivot with respect to one another to permit relative vertical movement of the horizontal pipe <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The header <b>28</b> is also supported by a pair of support links or arms <b>44</b>. Each of the support links <b>44</b> has one end <b>46</b> pivotally connected to a band <b>48</b> surrounding and supporting the header <b>31</b> and an opposite end <b>50</b> pivotally connected or mounted to the floor <b>24</b> of the tank <b>12</b>. The support links <b>44</b> have the same length as the elbow joint pipe <b>38</b> and function to maintain the horizontal pipe <b>31</b> parallel to the floor <b>24</b> in response to relative movement of the pipe <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A pair of actuators <b>52</b> are also provided for effecting vertical movement of the header <b>28</b> with respect to the floor <b>24</b> of the tank. The actuators <b>52</b> each have one end supported by the floor <b>24</b> of the tank and an opposite end connected to the header <b>28</b> to move the header vertically. The actuators <b>52</b> can be a pneumatically actuated piston and cylinder. In other arrangements, the actuators could be a hydraulically actuated piston and cylinder or a screw driven extendable actuator, the screw being driven by an electric motor, mechanical language, by an air motor or hydraulic motor.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A control <b>58</b> is mounted externally to the tank <b>12</b> and can be connected through line <b>60</b> to the actuators <b>52</b> to control operation of the actuators <b>52</b> and thus control the relative vertical position of the header <b>28</b> in the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In operation, the control <b>58</b> and actuators <b>52</b> can be used to change the vertical position of the header <b>28</b> in the tank and such that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the relative vertical height of one header <b>28</b> can be changed with respect to the vertical height of another header <b>28</b> in the wastewater treatment tank <b>12</b>. The head pressure of the wastewater <b>26</b> on the surface of the diffusers <b>22</b> can thus be changed to achieve a balance of air flow through the two sets of diffusers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. During operation of the two sets of diffusers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, the characteristics of the diffusers may change over time. These changes may be caused by microbial growth on the diffusers or by changes over time in the material characteristics of the diffusers. The operating parameters of the wastewater system may also change over time due to fluctuations in the quantity of wastewater flowing into the wastewater treatment system or changes in the characteristics of the wastewater being treated by the system.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The control <b>58</b> and actuators <b>52</b> can be used to maintain balance of the air flow through the different types of diffusers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> and accommodate changes in the use of the wastewater system or changes in the flow characteristics of the diffusers over time.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an alternative arrangement for flexibly connecting the horizontal header <b>31</b> to the air supply pipe <b>30</b>. In the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the vertical pipe <b>30</b> supplying air flow to the horizontal header includes a flexible section of pipe <b>20</b>, the flexible section of pipe having sufficient flexibility to accommodate several inches of vertical movement of the horizontal header <b>31</b> with respect to the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates another alternative arrangement wherein a flexible section <b>80</b> of pipe is provided in the end of the horizontal header <b>31</b> where the horizontal header <b>31</b> is connected to the air pipe <b>30</b> feeding air to the header. The flexible section of pipe <b>80</b> accommodates relative vertical adjustment movement of the horizontal header <b>31</b> with respect to the air supply pipe <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another arrangement wherein a flexible section of pipe <b>72</b> is joined in the air supply pipe <b>30</b> to accommodate relative vertical movement of the horizontal header <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows another alternative arrangement wherein an elbow joint <b>86</b> is provided between the air supply pipe <b>30</b> and the horizontal header <b>31</b> to facilitate relative vertical movement of the horizontal header <b>31</b> with respect to the supply pipe <b>30</b> in the bottom of the wastewater treatment tank.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the method using the apparatus above to test temperature includes the following steps:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0012">S<b>1</b>: the contacts C of the relay R<b>21</b> connect to the corresponding contacts B, the other relays maintain original state, the cold junction compensator <b>22</b> is connected to the switch circuit <b>40</b>, the cold junction compensator <b>22</b> charges the capacitor <b>42</b>;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0013">S<b>2</b>: after charging of the capacitor <b>42</b> is completed, the contacts C of the relay R<b>41</b> connect to the corresponding contacts A, the other relays return to their original states;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0014">S<b>3</b>: the MPU <b>50</b> reading the voltage at the capacitor <b>42</b> and converting the voltage to a compensation temperature;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0015">S<b>4</b>: the contacts C of the relay R<b>11</b> connect to the corresponding contacts B, the other relays return to their original state, the contacts C of the relay R<b>41</b> are connected to ground, thus the capacitor <b>42</b> discharges through the relay R<b>11</b>;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0016">S<b>5</b>: the contacts C of the relay R<b>31</b> connect to the corresponding contacts B, the other relays return to their original state, the power supply <b>32</b> charges the capacitor <b>42</b>;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0017">S<b>6</b>: the contacts C of the relay R<b>1</b> connect to the corresponding contacts A, if the thermo-couple TC<b>1</b> is broken, the capacitor <b>42</b> cannot release voltage; if the thermo-couple TC<b>1</b> is good, the capacitor <b>42</b> discharges through the thermo-couple TC<b>1</b>, and then is charged by the thermo-couple TC<b>1</b>;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0018">S<b>7</b>: the contacts C of the relay R<b>41</b> connect to the corresponding contacts A respectively, the other relays return to their original state;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0019">S<b>8</b>: the MPU <b>50</b> reads voltage at the capacitor <b>42</b>;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0020">S<b>9</b>: if the voltage the MPU <b>50</b> obtains is equal to the voltage of the power supply <b>32</b>, the thermo-couple TC<b>1</b> is broken; if not, the temperature at the thermo-couple TC<b>1</b> is the sum of the temperature corresponding to the voltage the MPU <b>50</b> obtained and the compensation temperature, then continue to test the next TC channel <b>1</b>.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0021">S<b>10</b>: judging whether the code of the channel to be tested is greater than or equal to 10, if yes, the test is terminated; if not, return to the step S<b>1</b>, and go on testing.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0022">The apparatus uses relays as the switches, and all the testing channels use a common capacitor <b>42</b>, when in use, the relays and the capacitor <b>42</b> insulate the thermo-couples and the MPU <b>50</b>, thus eliminating creepage and interference to the MPU <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0023">The foregoing description of the exemplary embodiment of the invention has been presented only for the purposes of illustration and description and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to pen retention devices, and particularly to of point of sale signature pen retention devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Point of sale devices may provide pens, such as electronic signature pens for example, for a shopper to authorize a sale transaction. It is important to retain and secure the pen in a location that is convenient for use and such that it cannot easily be taken by the shopper. Typical pen retention arrangements include a tether attached to the pen and a retracting reel, such that the tether is drawn into the retracting reel when the pen is not in use. The pen is intended to be disposed within an accompanying recess such that the pen does not obstruct a flow of purchased products. To discourage any pilferage of the pen, tether, and retracting reel, the retracting reel is often disposed beneath a surface of the point of sale device, such that it is inaccessible to the shopper.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disposal of the retracting reel beneath the surface of the point of sale device may result in application of force to the pen, via the tether, in a direction that increases a difficulty of use of the pen. Further, failure by the shopper to ensure proper return of the pen to the accompanying recess may result in the pen becoming entangled with the flow of purchased products and lead to tether failure. Repair of such tether failure requires a service technician to disassemble the point of sale device and replace the retracting reel, tether, and pen. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a pen retention arrangement that overcomes these drawbacks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An embodiment of the invention includes a pen retention bracket for releasably securing a pen tether retracting reel therein. The bracket includes a first and second surface disposed parallel and opposite one another and a third and fourth surface disposed parallel and opposite one another. The first, second, third, and fourth surfaces define a rectangular cavity having four sides including the first, second, third and fourth surfaces. The rectangular cavity includes a top opening and bottom opening disposed parallel and opposite one another.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first protrusion and a second protrusion are disposed upon the first surface, and extend from the first surface toward the second surface. A distance between the first protrusion and the second protrusion is greater than a height of the pen tether retracting reel. A depth between the first surface and the second surface is approximately equal to a depth of the pen tether retracting reel and a depth between the second surface and both of the first protrusion and the second protrusion is less than the depth of the pen tether retracting reel. The first surface is responsive to an application of force to the pen tether retracting reel to elastically deform and increase the depth between the second surface and at least one of the first protrusion and the second protrusion, thereby releasing the pen tether retracting reel via either of the top opening and the bottom opening.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another embodiment of the invention includes a pen retention device that includes a pen, a tether having a first end and a second end, the first end of the tether attached to the pen, a retracting reel in operable communication with the second end of the tether, and a bracket releasably securing the retracting reel therein. The bracket includes a first and second surface disposed parallel and opposite one another and a third and fourth surface disposed parallel and opposite one another. The first, second, third, and fourth surfaces define a cavity having four sides including the first, second, third and fourth surfaces. The cavity includes a top opening and bottom opening disposed parallel and opposite one another.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An embodiment of the invention provides a pen retention bracket to retain and secure the retracting reel, tether, and pen. The pen retention bracket further allows replacement of the retracting reel, tether, and pen by a retailer without need for a service technician to disassemble the point of sale device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> depict an embodiment of a pen retention device <b>100</b>. The pen retention device <b>100</b> includes a bracket <b>105</b>, a retracting reel <b>110</b> (also herein referred to as a &#x201c;pen tether retracting reel&#x201d;), a pen <b>115</b>, and a tether <b>120</b>, such as a string or wire for example. The tether includes a first end <b>118</b> attached to the pen <b>115</b> and a second end <b>119</b> in operable communication with the retracting reel <b>110</b>. The tether <b>120</b> is withdrawn from the retracting reel <b>110</b> to allow the shopper to utilize the pen <b>115</b> to authorize a sales transaction. The retracting reel <b>110</b> includes a retraction mechanism such as a spring to retract or return the tether <b>120</b> within the retracting reel <b>110</b> when the pen <b>115</b> in not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The bracket <b>105</b> includes mounting features <b>121</b>, such as holes, for mounting to a point of sale device (not shown). In an exemplary embodiment, the bracket <b>105</b> is installed vertically above an area in which the pen <b>115</b> shall be used, such that any force exerted upon the pen <b>115</b> by the retracting reel <b>110</b> shall be directed upwards to prevent an increase in difficulty of use of the pen <b>115</b> by a downwardly directed force. Further, an embodiment of the bracket <b>105</b> includes a recess <b>122</b>, to reduce interference between the bracket <b>105</b> and the tether <b>120</b>, thereby reducing a likelihood of fraying of the tether <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The bracket <b>105</b> surrounds the retracting reel <b>110</b>, thereby defining a cavity <b>125</b> to retain the retracting reel <b>110</b>. The cavity <b>125</b> has a top opening <b>130</b> and a bottom opening <b>135</b> disposed opposite the top opening <b>130</b>. The retracting reel <b>110</b> may be inserted into the cavity <b>125</b> via either of the top opening <b>130</b> and the bottom opening <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A first surface <b>150</b> of the bracket <b>105</b> is disposed parallel and opposite to a second surface <b>155</b>. A third surface <b>157</b> is disposed parallel and opposite to a fourth surface <b>158</b>. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the first surface <b>150</b>, second surface <b>155</b>, third surface <b>157</b>, and fourth surface <b>158</b> define the cavity <b>125</b> to be a rectangular cavity <b>125</b> having four sides that include the first, second, third, and fourth surfaces <b>150</b>, <b>155</b>, <b>157</b>, <b>158</b> and the top opening <b>120</b> and bottom opening <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A distance or depth &#x201c;d&#x201d; of the cavity <b>125</b> from the first surface <b>150</b> to the second surface <b>155</b> is approximately equal to a depth of the retracting reel <b>110</b>. As used herein &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; represents deviation resulting from design, manufacturing, and material tolerances, as well as a desired interface between the retracting reel <b>110</b> the cavity <b>125</b>, such as a slip fit assembly, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Two protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> (also herein referred to as a &#x201c;first protrusion&#x201d; and a &#x201c;second protrusion&#x201d;) are disposed upon the first surface <b>150</b> of the bracket, and extend from the first surface <b>150</b> into the cavity <b>125</b> toward the second surface <b>155</b>, such that the depth from the protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> to the second surface <b>155</b> is less than the depth of the retracting reel <b>110</b>. A height &#x201c;h&#x201d; between the protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> is equal to or greater than a height of the retracting reel <b>110</b>. Accordingly, the protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> restrict or interfere with, movement toward either the top opening <b>130</b> or the bottom opening <b>135</b> of the retracting reel <b>110</b> disposed between the protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> within the cavity <b>125</b>. The protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> are each defined by a height &#x201c;y&#x201d; and a width &#x201c;x&#x201d;. In one embodiment, the width &#x201c;x&#x201d; is greater than the height &#x201c;y&#x201d;, such that the protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> are rectangular protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The material of the bracket <b>105</b> deforms in an elastic manner, such that surface <b>150</b> may be displaced away from surface <b>155</b> to increase the depth &#x201c;d&#x201d; of the cavity <b>125</b>. In response to such displacement of surface <b>150</b> away from surface <b>155</b>, the depth from the protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> to surface <b>155</b> is increased. Further, in response to displacement of surface <b>150</b> such that the depth from the protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> to surface <b>155</b> is equal to or greater than the depth of the retracting reel <b>110</b>, the retracting reel <b>110</b> may be inserted into the cavity <b>125</b> for disposal between the protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> via either of the top opening <b>130</b> or the bottom opening <b>135</b>. Likewise, in response to displacement of surface <b>150</b> such that the depth from the protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> is equal to or greater than the depth of the retracting reel <b>110</b>, the retracting reel <b>110</b> disposed within the cavity <b>125</b> between the protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> may be removed from the cavity <b>125</b> via either of the top opening <b>130</b> or the bottom opening <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A material from which the bracket <b>105</b> is fabricated and a thickness of the material influences an amount of force required to displace surface <b>150</b> such that the depth from the protrusions <b>140</b>, <b>145</b> to surface <b>155</b> is equal to or greater than the depth of the retracting reel <b>110</b>. Accordingly, selection of at least one of the material and the thickness of the material from which the bracket <b>105</b> is made effects an amount of force applied to the retracting reel <b>110</b> via at least one of the pen <b>115</b> and the tether <b>120</b> to remove or release the retracting reel <b>110</b> from the cavity <b>125</b>. As such, the bracket <b>105</b> provides a &#x201c;break-away&#x201d; feature that releases the retracting reel <b>110</b> in response to application of the amount of force that exceeds a release force. Furthermore, removal of material from a corner <b>160</b> of the bracket <b>105</b> disposed between the first surface <b>150</b> and the third surface <b>157</b> defines an opening <b>165</b>, such as a rectangular aperture <b>165</b>. An amount of material removed from the corner <b>160</b>, and thus the size of the rectangular aperture <b>165</b> is inversely related to the amount of release force required to remove the retracting reel <b>110</b> from the cavity <b>125</b>. That is, the more material removed, the larger the opening <b>165</b>, and the less the release force required to remove the retracting reel <b>110</b> from the cavity <b>125</b> of the bracket <b>105</b>. Accordingly, selection of the material, material thickness and opening <b>165</b> dimensions determine the release force. Stated alternatively, the first surface <b>150</b> is responsive to an application of force to the retracting reel <b>110</b> to elastically deform away from the second surface <b>155</b> and thereby release the pen tether retracting reel <b>110</b> via one of the top opening <b>130</b> and the bottom opening <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the release force is selected to release the retracting reel <b>110</b> prior to damage to (or failure of) either the tether <b>120</b> or the retracting reel <b>110</b>. Therefore, following such release of the retracting reel <b>110</b>, useful functionality of the retracting reel <b>110</b>, pen <b>115</b>, and tether <b>120</b> is preserved. For example, following an inadvertent entanglement of the pen <b>115</b> with a purchased product (not shown) the bracket <b>105</b> releases the retracting reel <b>110</b> prior to exertion of a force great enough to damage either the tether <b>120</b> or the retracting reel <b>110</b>. Such release of the retracting reel <b>110</b> prior to exertion of a force great enough to damage either the tether <b>120</b> or retracting reel <b>110</b> is contemplated to reduce a likelihood of shopper injury and allow subsequent reinstallation of the released retracting reel <b>110</b>. Furthermore, interaction between the retracting reel <b>110</b> and the bracket <b>105</b> may be apparent to the shopper, who may proceed to disentangle the pen <b>120</b> and replace the retracting reel <b>110</b> within the cavity <b>125</b> of the bracket <b>105</b>. In any event, installation of a replacement retracting reel <b>110</b>, whether it be the released reel <b>110</b> or a new reel <b>110</b>, is easily accomplished with a need for neither disassembly of the point of sale device (not shown) nor a technician service repair call.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the bracket <b>105</b> is made from steel having a thickness of approximately 1.5 millimeters (mm), with the opening <b>165</b> having a height &#x201c;z&#x201d; of approximately 20 mm.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to an electrical connector for use in electric and electronic appliances such as industrial machines, car navigation systems, and the like, and more particularly to an electrical connector superior in resistance to vibration and enabling floating of a part in the connector even when a space-saving is achieved (width dimension in a fitted state being less than 5 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In hitherto used electrical connectors having a floating part, two insulators have often been used, either of which is supported only by contacts having an elastic portion which is elastically deformable. It has been found that in order to provide an elasticity to contacts, elastic portions of the contacts are snaked or curved, or the contacts are elongated by increasing a distance between two insulators.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As examples of prior art electrical connectors, incorporated herein are Japanese Patent Application Opened No. 2002-42,937 (Patent Literature 1), Japanese Patent Application Opened No. 2002-352,908 (Patent Literature 2) and Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-45,525 (Patent Literature 3), these being proposed by the applicant of the present case.</p>

Disclosed is an electrical connector <b>1</b> consisting of a pin connector <b>10</b> and a socket connector <b>20</b> detachably fitted with each other, wherein a locator <b>40</b> having a groove <b>42</b> of a size for receiving the socket connector <b>20</b> is provided with engaging means adapted to engage the socket connector <b>20</b>, and the socket connector <b>20</b> is mounted on the locator <b>40</b> and floatingly fixed to the substrate <b>60</b>. Moreover, the socket connector <b>20</b> has a floating function by setting the length of socket contacts <b>24</b> within the locator <b>40</b> to 5 mm to 10 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In connection with the above description, claim 1 of the Japanese Patent Application Opened No. 2002-42,937 recites an electrical connector consisting of a pin connector and a socket connector detachably fitted with each other, said pin connector comprising a required number of pin contacts and a block for holding and fixing said pin contacts, and said socket connector comprising a required number of socket contacts to contact said pin contacts and a housing for holding and fixing said socket contacts, wherein a locator having a groove of a size for receiving said socket connector is provided with engaging means adapted to engage said socket connector, and said socket connector is mounted on the locator and is floatingly fixed to a substrate. Claim <b>2</b> recites the electrical connector as claimed in claim <b>1</b>, wherein the length of socket contacts within said locator is 5 to 10 mm to provide the floating function to the socket connector. Claim <b>3</b> recites the electrical connector as claimed in claim <b>1</b>, wherein said locator is formed with grooves continuously provided so that the socket contacts of said socket connector are displaceable in said continuously provided grooves, thereby providing the floating function to the socket connector. Claim <b>4</b> recites the electrical connector as claimed in claim <b>2</b>, wherein said socket contacts are bent or twisted substantially at right angles in the continuously provided grooves of said locator. Claim <b>5</b> recites the electrical connector as claimed in claim <b>2</b>, wherein said socket contacts are curved in the continuously provided grooves of said locator.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In connection with the above description, claim 1 of the Japanese Patent Application Opened No. 2003-45,525 recites a connector to be mounted on a substrate, including contacts each having a contact portion adapted to contact a mating contact, a fixed portion to be fixed to a block, and a connection portion to be connected to the substrate, and the block for holding and fixing a required number of the contacts, wherein the contacts each comprise an elastic portion having at least one snaked portion between the fixed portion and the connection portion, and the block is provided with a housing having a substantially box shape with a clearance relative to the outer dimension of the block and located on the side of the connection portions of the contacts, thereby enabling the positioning of the connection portions of the contacts relatively to the substrate and enabling floating of the connector. Claim <b>2</b> recites the connector as claimed in claim <b>1</b>, wherein the housing having arm portions is formed on both sides in width direction with slits adjacent to the arm portions to provide elasticity to the arm portions for facilitating mounting of locking portions of the block onto the arm portions. Claim <b>3</b> recites the connector as claimed in claim <b>2</b>, wherein the contacts are each provided between the elastic portion and the connection portion with a fitting portion adapted to engage an inserting hole of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In recent years, a wide variety of technical requirements for electrical connectors from customers have been increased. Aside from a distance between substrates with fitted plug and receptacle connectors, there have been increasing demands for electrical connectors which achieve space-saving as much as possible when fitted (miniaturized width dimension), and are superior in resistance to vibration, while enabling floating of a part resulting in higher connection stability.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, in order to achieve the space-saving (miniaturized width dimension), thicknesses of walls must be thinner as much as possible, while for the purpose of improving the resistance to vibration, the thicknesses of the walls must be thicker as much as possible so that the contradictory problems remain to be solved. In order to realize the floating of the part, contacts need to be snaked or curved to have an elasticity and two insulators need to be combined so that the width dimension becomes necessarily greater which is contrary to the space-saving.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The constructions of the Patent Literatures 1 to 3 could not fulfill all these requirements described above.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">The important aspect of the invention lies in the electrical connector <b>10</b> consisting of a plug connector <b>50</b> and a receptacle connector <b>20</b> detachably fitted with each other, said receptacle connector <b>20</b> including a plurality of receptacle contacts <b>24</b> each having a first contact portion <b>26</b> adapted to contact a mating contact, a first fixed portion <b>28</b> to be fixed to a block <b>22</b>, and a first connection portion <b>30</b> to be connected to a substrate <b>90</b>, and the block <b>22</b> for arranging and holding said receptacle contacts <b>24</b>, and said plug connector <b>50</b> including a plurality of plug contacts <b>56</b> each having a second contact portion <b>58</b> adapted to contact said receptacle contact <b>24</b>, second and third fixed portions <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> to be fixed to a housing <b>52</b> and an insulator <b>54</b>, respectively, and a second connection portion <b>64</b> to be connected to a substrate <b>90</b>, and the housing <b>52</b> and the insulator <b>54</b> for arranging and holding said plug contacts <b>56</b>, wherein each of said plug contacts <b>56</b> is provided between said second and third fixed portions <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> with an elastic portion <b>66</b> having at least one snaked portion, and said insulator <b>54</b> is held in a floating state in said housing <b>52</b> by supporting the insulator <b>54</b> only by said pug contacts <b>56</b>, wherein the shape of the second contact portion <b>58</b> of each of said plug contacts <b>56</b> is substantially in the form of a plate-shaped piece, and further the second contact portion <b>58</b> of each of said plug contacts <b>56</b> and the first contact portion <b>26</b> of each of said receptacle contacts <b>24</b> are caused to contact each other in line contact at one location, and wherein said elastic portion <b>66</b> of each of said plug contacts <b>56</b> is arranged within a range from a position below said second contact portion <b>58</b> on the side of the second connection portion <b>64</b> to a position below said insulator <b>54</b> on the side of the second connection portion <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">That is to say, the insulator made of a plastic material of the plug connector <b>50</b> is divided into two parts, that is, the housing <b>52</b> and the insulator <b>54</b>, and the insulator <b>54</b> is supported only by the plug contacts <b>56</b> each having the elastic portion <b>66</b>, thereby enabling the insulator to be movable or to do floating. The elastic portion <b>66</b> of each of the plug contacts <b>56</b> is arranged from a position below said second contact portion <b>58</b> (on the side of the second connection portion <b>64</b>) to a position below said insulator <b>54</b> (on the side of the second connection portion <b>64</b>), thereby increasing the thicknesses of the walls of the housing <b>52</b> to improve a resistance to vibration, while maintaining the space-saving.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">A vibration test of the electrical connectors according to the invention and of the prior art No. 1 and No. 2 will be explained. The test was carried out under conditions of vibrations of frequencies of 20 to 200 Hz, an acceleration of 10 G, and testing time of 15 min/cycle, and time periods from start to instantaneous interruption were measured. The results are shown in Table 1. The operation of an electrical connector of prior art No. 1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> ended only after one hour from starting, and the operation of an electrical connector of prior art No. 2 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> ended after four hours from starting. In contrast herewith, the normal operation of the electrical connector according to the invention persisted for more than ten hours which indicates the improved resistance to vibration according to the invention.</p>

The respective portions will be explained hereafter. First, the second contact portion <b>58</b> is adapted to contact the first contact portion <b>26</b> of the receptacle contact <b>24</b>. The second contact portion <b>58</b> is substantially in the form of a flat plate piece which contacts a first contact portion <b>26</b> of the receptacle contact <b>24</b> in a line contact at one location. The second contact portion <b>58</b> need only be able to contact the first contact portion <b>26</b> of said receptacle contact <b>24</b> and may be suitably designed in consideration of contact stability, space saving and a reduced overall height of the electrical connector <b>10</b> upon being fitted, workability and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">Said second fixed portion <b>60</b> is adapted to be held one of the second inserting holes <b>78</b> of the housing <b>52</b>. The second fixed portion <b>60</b> is held by press-fitting it into the inserting hole <b>78</b> in the illustrated embodiment, but any holding methods may be employed insofar as the second fixed portion <b>60</b> can be firmly held in the inserting hole <b>78</b> and may be suitably designed taking into account a miniaturization of the connector, strength, holding force and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">Said elastic portion <b>66</b> serves to hold said insulator <b>54</b> in a floating state or to be movable (floating). The elastic portion <b>66</b> has one snaked or tortuous portion at one location in the illustrated embodiment. Said elastic portion <b>66</b> is arranged between said second fixed portion <b>60</b> and said third fixed portion <b>62</b> and further within the range from a position below said second contact portion <b>58</b> (on the side of the second connection portion <b>64</b>) to a position below said insulator <b>54</b> (on the side of the second connection portion <b>64</b>). The number of the snaked portion may be arbitrary so long as said insulator <b>54</b> can move (enables the floating), but may be suitably designed in consideration of space-saving and reduced overall height of the fitted electrical connector <b>10</b>, workability, and the like. The radius <b>72</b> of curvature of the snaked portion may be suitably designed taking into account the space-saving and reduced overall height of the fitted electrical connector <b>10</b>, workability, and the like. The radius of curvature is 0.2 to 0.7 mm in the illustrated embodiment. If it is less than 0.2 mm, the elasticity of the curved portions becomes insufficient to permit the floating, while if it is more than 0.7 mm, the space-saving of the fitted electrical connector <b>10</b> could not be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">Said third fixed portion <b>62</b> of the plug contact <b>56</b> is adapted to be held in the third inserting hole <b>80</b> of said insulator <b>54</b>. The third fixed portions <b>62</b> are held in the inserting holes <b>80</b>, respectively, by press-fitting in the illustrated embodiment. However, any holding methods may be employed insofar as the third fixed portion <b>62</b> can be held in the insulator <b>54</b>, and the holding for the plug contacts <b>56</b> may be suitably designed in consideration of the miniaturization of the connector, strength, the holding force, floating faculty of the insulator, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">Said second connection portion <b>64</b> of the plug contact <b>56</b> is adapted to be connected to a substrate <b>90</b>. The shape (or type) of the second connection portions <b>64</b> is of a surface mounting type (SMT) in the illustrated embodiment, but the shape is arbitrary so long as it can be connected to the substrate, for example, it may be a dip type. Moreover, said second connection portions <b>64</b> are arranged so as not to extend from said housing <b>52</b> taking into account the space-saving.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">Considering the space-saving when fitted, it is preferable to provide a curved portion <b>74</b> between the third fixed portion and the elastic portion of said plug contact <b>56</b>, is folded or curved inwardly (onto opposite side of said side wall). By providing the curved portion <b>74</b>, a sufficient floating is ensured and space-saving is effectively achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">Said housing <b>52</b> will then be explained. Said housing <b>52</b> has a substantially U-shaped cross-section and is formed with the second inserting holes <b>78</b> whose number corresponds to the number of the plug contacts <b>56</b> for inserting and holding them therein. The shape and size of the second inserting holes <b>78</b> may be suitably designed in consideration of the size and shape of said plug contacts and holding force for the plug contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">Further, said housing <b>52</b> is formed with a space <b>68</b> for inserting said insulator <b>54</b> to be floating. The shape and size of said space <b>68</b> are arbitrary insofar as said space enables said insulator <b>54</b> to be received therein to permit floating of the insulator <b>54</b>. The space <b>68</b> is larger of the order of 0.3 mm to 1.0 mm than said insulator <b>54</b> in consideration of the amount of floating of the insulator <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">Said insulator <b>54</b> will then be explained. Said insulator <b>54</b> has a substantially T-shaped cross-section. The insulator <b>54</b> is formed with the third inserting holes <b>80</b> whose number corresponds to the number of said plug contacts <b>56</b> for inserting and holding the plug contacts therein. The shape and size of said third inserting holes <b>80</b> may be suitably designed taking into account the size and shape of said plug contacts and holding force for the plug contacts <b>56</b>. Further, the third inserting holes <b>80</b> are so shaped as to cause the first contact portions <b>26</b> of said receptacle contacts <b>24</b> to contact the second contact portions <b>58</b> of said plug contacts <b>56</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">The receptacle connector <b>20</b> will then be explained. Said receptacle connector <b>20</b> mainly comprises a block <b>22</b> and the receptacle contacts <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">First, the receptacle contacts <b>24</b> will be explained. Said receptacle contacts <b>24</b> are made of a metal and formed by means of the press-working of the known technique. Preferred metals from which to form said receptacle contacts <b>24</b> include brass, beryllium copper, phosphor bronze and the like which comply with the requirements as to springiness, electric conductivity, and the like. Said receptacle contact <b>24</b> mainly comprises a first contact portion <b>26</b> adapted to contact the plug contact <b>56</b>, a first fixed portion <b>28</b> to be fixed to said block <b>22</b>, and a first connection portion <b>30</b> to be connected to a substrate <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">The respective portions of the receptacle contact <b>24</b> are arranged in the order of the first contact portion <b>26</b>, the first fixed portion <b>28</b>, and the first connection portion <b>30</b>. The respective portions will be explained hereafter. First, the first contact portion <b>26</b> is adapted to contact the second contact portion <b>58</b> of the plug contact <b>56</b>. Said first contact portion <b>26</b> is substantially in the form of a bent plate piece which contacts the second contact portion <b>58</b> of the plug contact <b>56</b> in a line contact at one location. Said first contact portion <b>26</b> need only be able to contact the second contact portion <b>58</b> of said plug contact <b>56</b> and may be suitably designed in consideration of contact stability, space saving and reduced overall height of the electrical connector <b>10</b> upon being fitted, workability, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">Said first fixed portion <b>28</b> is held in one of the first inserting holes <b>34</b> of said block <b>22</b>. The first fixed portions <b>28</b> are held in the inserting holes <b>34</b> by press-fitting in the illustrated embodiment. Any holding methods may be employed so long as they are firmly held in the inserting holes and may be suitably designed taking into account the miniaturization of the connector, strength, holding force for the receptacle contacts, floating faculty of the insulator <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">The first connection portion <b>30</b> is adapted to be connected to the substrate <b>90</b>. The shape (or type) of the first connection portions <b>30</b> is of a surface mounting type (SMT) in the illustrated embodiment, but the shape (or type) is arbitrary insofar as it can be connected to the substrate <b>90</b>, for example, it may be a dip type. Moreover, said first connection portions <b>30</b> are arranged so as not to extend from the block <b>22</b> in consideration of the space-saving.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061">Said block <b>22</b> will then be explained. The block <b>22</b> has a substantially T-shaped cross-section. The block <b>22</b> is formed from an electrically insulating plastic material by means of the injection molding of the known technique. The materials for the block <b>22</b> may be suitably selected in consideration of dimensional stability, workability, manufacturing cost, and the like and generally include polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyamide (66PA or 46PA), liquid crystal polymer (LCP), polycarbonate (PC), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), and the like and combination thereof. Said block is formed with a required number of first inserting holes <b>34</b> for installing the receptacle contacts, respectively, by press-fitting, hooking (lancing), welding, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">Examples of applications of the invention are electrical connectors for use in electric and electronic appliances for industrial machines, car navigation systems, and the like, and more particularly electrical connectors superior in resistance to vibration and enabling floating of a part in the connector even when a space-saving is achieved (width dimension in a fitted state being less than 5 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a cob collection device for use with a corn harvester, which device more particularly incorporates a conveyor system providing a capability for positively removing or cleaning attached husks from the cobs, and which is operably movable in cooperation with the collection device for distributing delivery of cobs without husks thereto and for stowing the conveyor in a compacted manner to facilitate travel under bridges, utility wires, doorways and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Presently, there is an increased demand for corn cobs as a feedstock for cellulosic ethanol, as well as other uses. As a result, there is heightened interest in collecting corn cobs during corn harvest. There is also concern by some that cob collection may reduce soil nutrient content. In this regard, crop residue or stover, e.g., corn stalks, leaves, husks and cobs, are traditionally left on the field after harvest, and break down over time to replenish soil nutrients. If a component of the stover, e.g., cobs is instead collected, nutrient levels could be lowered as a result. To mitigate this concern, some consider it desirable when collecting cobs, to collect only the cobs, that is, clean cobs with substantially all residual husks, leaves and stalks removed, and return the other stover to the field. Thus, it is sought to have a cob collection device and conveyor adapted for operation in connection with a corn harvester, which incorporates an ability to separate or clean the cobs from the other stover, including removing husks and the like attached to the cobs, and return the other stover to the field or another location. It is also desirable for the collected cobs to be as compact as possible, e.g., without attached husks and the like, so as to maximize the amount of cobs that the collection device and subsequent containers can hold. Still further, for some techniques for producing ethanol from corn cobs, the presence of other stover, e.g., husks and the like, is undesired, and for a load of cobs of a given volume, the amount of compensation paid will be reduced if significant stover is present.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Numerous apparatus have been proposed for use in connection with cob collection devices, for cleaning or separating cobs from the other stover. To illustrate, prior to the early 1960's, the common corn harvesting practice involved picking the ears of corn in the field, removing husks from the ears, and transporting the ears still containing the corn kernels to a corn crib, and later shelling the corn off of the cobs at a stationary sheller. This harvesting procedure has been almost entirely replaced by modern self-propelled combine type harvesters, which separate and collect the corn kernels, and discharge the cobs and other stover onto the field.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Combines which harvest the corn and separate the kernels from the cobs and other stover or residue, then discharge the cobs and other stover onto the field, are now the industry standard. More recently, devices for collecting cobs discharged from combines have been developed. Several of such known devices have variously utilized a towed cart or wagon for receiving and holding the cobs, and a conveyor system for conveying the cobs from the combine to the cart or wagon. Some of the cob collection devices also include apparatus for separating the cobs from the other stover or residue, mainly using air flow. Reference in this regard, Flamme U.S. Pat. No. 5,941,768, issued Aug. 24, 1999, which discloses a cob collection unit pulled behind a combine to collect on a first conveyor all the residue discharged from the combine, with a separation unit behind the conveyor including a second conveyor, and utilizing a fan to suck the stover from the cobs as they are released from the top of the second conveyor and to blow the stover back onto the field. Redekop et al. U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20090095662 published Apr. 16, 2009; 20090104952 published Apr. 23, 2009; and 20090124309 published May 14, 2009, disclose a pulled cob collection unit, which utilizes a sequential series of inclined belt conveyors, and blower or suction fans for directing air through the discharged material as it falls from the upper end of one conveyor onto a lower end of the next conveyor, such that the heavier cobs are to continue to the next conveyor and the lighter stover or residue will be carried away by the air flow, with the cobs being conveyed into a collection tank by a further conveyor or conveyors.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Reference also Stukenholtz U.S. Pat. No. 6,358,141 issued Mar. 19, 2002, and Redekop et al. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20090137295, which disclose cob collection systems on a combine which utilize on-board bins and cob separation using sieves on the combine itself.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A shortcomings variously of the known cob collection devices and systems, is a lack of a capability for reliably removing husks and/or leaves, or fragments thereof, which still remain attached to the cobs after processing of the cobs through the systems of the combine, including gathering of the corn plants and separation of the corn ears from the stalks by the header, conveying through the feeder, agitation and separation of the kernels from the cobs by the threshing mechanism, and post-threshing handling, including in some cases passage through sieves and other systems designed for separating the cobs from the other residue or stover. Such attached husks and the like are disadvantageous as they increase the volume of the collected cobs, and reduce the ease of conveyance and compactability thereof, such that for a given volume of collected cobs, an undesirable portion of the volume can comprise the husks and the like which can have a lower energy content compared to the cobs alone, and create open spaces or interstices between the collected cobs, which factors can combine to reduce the value of a given volume of the collected cobs, as noted above.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, various of the known cob collection devices have a limited cob storage capacity or volume. In this regard, in many instances, it will be desirable to maximize the capacity of the cob collection device, within the load carrying or towing capability of the associated harvesting machine or other means of propulsion, which will typically entail maximizing the length and height dimensions of the cob collection device. For instance in this latter regard, it will typically be desirable for the height of the cob collection device to correspond to about that of the combine with which it is used. However, when a larger cob collection device is used, some manner of distributing the cobs within the device may be required, and the device should be adaptable for travel over public thoroughfares, under bridges and utility wires, and through doorways and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, what is sought is a cob collection device or apparatus for operation in association with a harvester, which provides one or more of the capabilities, namely, positively separating or detaching attached husks from the cobs, maximizing cob carrying capacity, and adaptability for travel over public thoroughfares, under bridges and utility wires, and through doorways and the like, and which overcomes one or more of the disadvantages, set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">What is disclosed is a cob collection device or apparatus for operation in association with a harvester, which provides one or more of the capabilities, namely, positively separating or detaching attached husks from the cobs, maximizing cob carrying capacity, and adaptability for travel over public thoroughfares, under bridges and utility wires, and through doorways and the like, and which overcomes one or more of the disadvantages, set forth above.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the cob collection device or apparatus includes a container which is preferably an upstanding wall structure bounding an interior chamber or cavity for receiving and holding a quantity of cobs. The upstanding wall structure includes a predetermined wall having an upper region including an aperture or opening therein. The cob collection device also preferably includes a door configured and movable between a closed position covering the aperture, and an open position uncovering the aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another preferred aspect, the cob collection device includes an adjustable conveyor system configured and operable for receiving a flow of the cobs from a harvester, at least some of which cobs typically have some husks, or portions of husks, still attached, as discussed above. The conveyor system has a conveyor portion including apparatus configured and operable for mechanically grasping and detaching the husks from the cobs and disposing of the husks, while conveying the cobs toward the cob collection device. The conveyor system also includes a conveyor portion inclined upwardly and configured and adjustably operable for conveying the cobs without the husks through the aperture of the upper region of the predetermined wall, and distributing the cobs within the interior chamber. In this latter regard, the conveyor portion inclined upwardly is preferably movable through a range of positions between a first position adjacent to the aperture and external to the interior chamber, and a second position extending a predetermined maximum distance into the interior chamber through the aperture, the range of positions including different intermediate positions for distributing the cobs at different locations within the interior cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to still another preferred aspect of the invention, a mechanism is provided configured and operable for automatically moving the optional door to the closed position when the conveyor portion inclined upwardly is moved to the first position. The mechanism is also preferably operable for moving the door in concert with the movements of the upwardly inclined conveyor portion through the intermediate positions, to enhance the ability to evenly distribute the cobs within the interior chamber, while limiting cob loss through the aperture. The mechanism can be yieldably biasable for this purpose, so as to essentially follow the movements of the inclined conveyor portion. With the conveyor removed from the collection device and the door closed, and with the collection device filled to capacity with cobs, the collection device can be unloaded, as required, such as, but not limited to, by raising and tilting.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As another preferred aspect of the invention, the conveyor system and collection device are carried on a trailer configured for towing behind a harvesting machine, e.g., a combine, for receiving the flow of the cobs therefrom, and the conveyor portion inclined upwardly is pivotable through the range of positions relative to the trailer, e.g., by a suitable actuator such as a fluid cylinder or cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As still another preferred aspect of the invention, the apparatus for mechanically grasping and detaching the attached husks from the cobs includes a first conveyor having a first end, an opposite second end, and an array of husking rolls extending therebetween defining an upwardly facing surface configured and positioned for receiving the flow of the cobs including husks and conveying the cobs to the second end. Here, it should be noted that unlike de-husking operations wherein the husks are removed from whole ears of corn, prior to removal of the kernels of corn, and wherein apparatus is provided for feeding the whole ears in end-to-end relation as they are de-husked, in the present application, a flow of the cobs, after removal of the corn, and some with remaining husks attached, are being dumped directly onto the first conveyor, in a disordered mixture containing other crop residue. Additionally, it should be noted that the volume of cobs flowing onto the conveyor can be quite large, depending on factors such as corn yield and the size of the corn harvester, e.g., 5 row up to 12 row or more.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With the above factors in mind, the first conveyor is preferably configured for rapidly de-husking a large volume of randomly oriented cobs and cob fragments mixed with a variety of other corn residue or stover. In this regard, each of the husking rolls bounds a gap sufficiently large for passage of the husks therethrough but smaller than the cobs. These gaps are also sufficient for receiving smaller elements of crop residue. Each of the husking rolls is supported for rotation about an axis therethrough and connected to drive apparatus configured for drivingly rotating the husking rolls about the axes, respectively, the husking rolls including husking elements thereon configured such that during the rotation, the elements will positively grasp and detach the husks from the cobs and pull or drive the detached husks through the gaps into a region below the conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to yet another preferred aspect of the invention, the husking elements comprise suitable structure for grasping and pulling or otherwise detaching the husks from the cobs, such as, but not limited to, concave regions adapted for receiving the husks as the cobs are conveyed along the conveyor, disposed about outer surfaces of the husking rolls, respectively, and bounded by edges configured for grasping and pulling the husks off of the cobs. Essentially, as the rolls are rotated and the cobs are conveyed therealong, the husks but not the cobs will be received in the concave regions of the rolls, so as to be carried about the rolls into the adjacent gap, the trailing edges of the rolls will then rotate into the adjacent gap to firmly grasp the husks to positively mechanically pull or rip them from the cobs, and carry the husks to the underside of the rolls where the cobs will be released to fall to the field, be blown away, or the like. Other smaller elements of stover, e.g., leaf, stalk, and cob fragments, can also be carried below the conveyor in a similar manner. And, the conveyor system can include other apparatus for removing other loose crop residue or stover intermingled with the cobs, and spreading or distributing the residue over a field, which apparatus can include, but is not limited to, one or more blowers or fans such as disclosed in the prior art, as desired or required for a particular application.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now the drawings, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a representative agricultural harvesting machine <b>20</b> is shown, which is a combine constructed and operable in the well known manner for harvesting whole ears of corn from corn plants as the combine travels over a field. Combine <b>20</b> includes well known apparatus (not shown) that gathers and conveys the ears of corn into a threshing system <b>22</b> within the combine which removes most of the husk surrounding the ears, and the corn kernels from cobs of the ears, and directs a flow of the corn, cobs, or fragments thereof, and other residue or stover, all as generally denoted by arrow A, within a rear chamber of combine <b>20</b> to a cleaning system <b>24</b> of the combine. At the same time, larger residue such as leaves and the like, are directed within the rear chamber, as denoted by arrow B, to a spreader <b>26</b> on the rear end of the combine.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Cleaning system <b>24</b> of combine <b>20</b> is operable in the conventional manner to separate the cobs and other larger elements of the corn residue or stover from the kernels of corn and smaller elements of residue, and the corn is collected and conveyed into a clean grain tank <b>28</b> on combine <b>20</b>, or other receiver, while the cobs and other larger elements of the residue are discharged from the rear of cleaning system <b>24</b>, as denoted by arrow C. The clean corn is then unloaded from tank <b>28</b> using an unloader conveyor <b>30</b> in the conventional manner, by swinging conveyor <b>30</b> to a sidewardly extending position (not shown&#x2014;conveyor <b>30</b> being illustrated in a stowed or travel position here).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a cob collection device <b>32</b> is shown, which is constructed and operable according to the teachings of the present invention, for receiving the flow of cobs and other elements of corn residue or stover denoted by arrow C, removing remaining husks attached to the cobs, and collecting the cobs. Here, cob collection device <b>32</b> is configured to be located and supported on a trailer <b>34</b> suitably supported on wheels <b>36</b>, or tracks (not shown) for towing by combine <b>20</b>, although it is likewise contemplated that device <b>32</b> could be incorporated into the structure of the harvesting machine with which it is used, e.g., combine <b>20</b>, self-propelled, or otherwise moved in a manner adequate for receiving a flow of cobs from the harvesting machine.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Cob collection device <b>32</b> generally includes an upstanding wall structure <b>38</b> bounding an interior cavity or chamber <b>40</b> adapted for receiving and holding a quantity of cobs. Upstanding wall structure <b>38</b> includes a predetermined wall, here a front wall <b>42</b>, having an upper region <b>44</b> including an aperture <b>46</b> therein. Cob collection device <b>32</b> preferably includes a door <b>48</b> (one alternative door <b>50</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) configured so as to be movable between a closed or raised position covering aperture <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and an open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, cob collection device <b>32</b> includes an adjustable conveyor system <b>52</b> configured and operable for receiving flow of cobs C from combine <b>20</b>, which will typically include a large number of cobs <b>54</b> or fragments thereof, at least some of which initially have some husks <b>56</b>, or portions thereof, still attached, as illustrated. Also illustrated in flow C are a variety of other elements of corn crop residue or stover, denoted generally by numeral <b>58</b>, which can include, for instance, remnants of stalks, cobs, kernels, leaves, stalks, and the like. Conveyor system <b>52</b> includes a first conveyor <b>60</b> including apparatus <b>62</b> configured and operable receiving flow C, mechanically grasping and detaching husks <b>56</b> from cobs <b>54</b> thereof, and disposing of the husks, while conveying cobs <b>54</b> to a second conveyor <b>64</b>. Second conveyor <b>64</b> is inclined upwardly from conveyor <b>60</b>, and is configured and adjustably operable for conveying cobs <b>54</b> without at least most of husks <b>56</b>, accordingly denoted by arrow Cl in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, through or over aperture <b>46</b> of wall <b>42</b>, and distributing the cobs within interior chamber <b>40</b>. Second conveyor <b>64</b> is preferably pivotably movable through a range of positions, denoted by arrows D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, between a first position shown in dotted lines adjacent to aperture <b>46</b> and external to interior chamber <b>40</b> (and in solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and a second position extending a predetermined maximum distance into interior chamber <b>40</b> through aperture <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>7</b>), the range of positions including different intermediate positions for distributing the flow of cobs Cl at different locations within interior cavity <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>, first conveyor <b>60</b> is disposed on a forward end of trailer <b>34</b>, beneath spreader <b>26</b> (if present), and in the path of flow C. This is advantageous, as it positions conveyor <b>60</b> for receiving substantially all of cobs <b>54</b> and other residue <b>58</b> discharged from combine <b>20</b>, and also any crop residue <b>58</b> which may fall from spreader <b>26</b>, and conveyor <b>60</b> will have a suitable width for accomplishing this and/or combine <b>20</b> can include a tray or pan for facilitating the transfer of the flow C onto conveyor <b>60</b>, as required or desired. Apparatus <b>62</b> essentially comprises a generally flat upwardly facing surface <b>66</b> comprising a side-by-side array of elongate husking rolls <b>68</b> supported by as suitable framework or other structure on trailer <b>34</b>, for rotation about longitudinal axes through the respective rolls. Selected adjacent ones of husking rolls <b>68</b> bound longitudinally extending gaps <b>70</b> therebetween, gaps <b>70</b> being sufficiently large for receiving husks <b>56</b> and smaller elements of crop residue <b>58</b> therein, but not cobs <b>54</b>. The selected ones of husking rolls <b>68</b> are connected to a drive <b>72</b> which can include, for instance, a fluid or electric motor <b>73</b>, connected in driving relation to a drive train including gears, shafts, belts, chains, or the like, operable for counter-rotating the rolls, as denoted by arrows X and Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Husking rolls <b>68</b> preferably include husking elements <b>74</b> on the outer surfaces thereof, configured for operation in cooperation with the adjacent rolls <b>68</b>, for mechanically grasping and detaching attached husks <b>56</b> from cobs <b>54</b> as husking rolls <b>68</b> are rotated in contact with the cobs. It is contemplated that husking elements <b>72</b> can have a variety of configurations, e.g., shapes and features, for grasping and pulling husks <b>56</b> from cobs <b>54</b>, husking elements <b>72</b> on some of rolls <b>68</b> preferably being configured as longitudinally extending helical concave regions <b>76</b> on the outer surfaces of rolls <b>68</b>, bounded by longitudinally extending, raised helical edges <b>78</b>, while others of the elements <b>72</b> on opposing ones of rolls <b>68</b> are preferably configured as annular serrations <b>80</b> about the rolls, the opposing husking elements being adapted to cooperatively operate for grasping husks <b>56</b> and rapidly pulling them from cobs <b>54</b>, and downwardly into and through gaps <b>70</b>, along with any loose residue <b>58</b>, as the rolls are rotated. The rotation and husking elements <b>72</b> can also cooperate so as to act to convey cobs <b>54</b> rapidly along surface <b>66</b>, either alone, or in cooperation with gravity, e.g., by inclining surface <b>66</b> downwardly in the conveying direction, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, or additional conveyance apparatus (not shown), such as wheels, belts or the like which can be incorporated into surface <b>66</b> or disposed thereabove.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As noted above, it should be understood that unlike conventional husking bed applications wherein husks are removed from ears of corn prior to removal of the corn kernels from the cobs, and wherein the ears are conveyed in orderly end to end relation along the husking rolls, here, the corn kernels have already been removed from the cobs and the cobs with remaining attached husks can comprise whole cobs, and/or cob fragments of various sizes, and, individually, will be substantially lighter in weight compared to whole ears of corn. Additionally, as a result of prior processing by combine <b>20</b>, husks <b>56</b> which remain attached to cobs <b>54</b> will be oriented in a variety of ways relative to the cobs, including extending sidewardly, backwards, etc., and the husks will likely be tough and/or resilient, stringy, and otherwise hard to detach. Flow of cobs C can also contain a wide variety of other loose residue <b>58</b> and will not comprise an orderly end-to-end procession of ears. As a result, husking rolls <b>68</b> and associated husking elements <b>74</b> are desirably configured to grasp and detach husks <b>56</b> from cobs <b>54</b>, while in a state of agitation, e.g., tumbling and rolling along surface <b>66</b> in a variety of orientations, essentially as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The respective gaps <b>70</b> between side-by-side rolls <b>68</b> preferably extend through conveyor <b>60</b> so as to communicate with a region <b>82</b> therebelow, which is preferably open to the ground surface <b>84</b>, such that the detached husks <b>56</b>, and other elements of crop residue <b>58</b> will fall onto ground surface <b>84</b>, as denoted by arrows E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>6</b>. This is desirable and advantageous, as it provides crop residue coverage for that region of ground surface <b>84</b> disposed beneath device <b>32</b>, crop residue being spread over other regions of ground surface <b>84</b> on opposite sides of device <b>32</b> by spreader <b>26</b>, if used. As a result, that portion of flow C remaining on surface <b>66</b> of conveyor <b>60</b> and conveyed to conveyor <b>64</b>, then distributed in chamber <b>40</b> of wall structure <b>38</b>, as denoted by arrow Cl, will comprise a mix of more cobs <b>54</b> and fewer, if any, husks <b>56</b>, and other residue <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Inclined second conveyor <b>64</b> is preferably narrower than first conveyor <b>60</b>, and to facilitate corresponding narrowing of flow C as it transitions to conveyor <b>64</b>, conveyor system <b>52</b> additionally preferably includes a third conveyor <b>86</b> disposed adjacent to a rear or second end of first conveyor <b>60</b>, and a lower forward or first lower end of conveyor <b>64</b>. Third conveyor <b>86</b> preferably spans the width of first conveyor <b>60</b> and is an upwardly open helical auger type conveyor, configured and operable for collecting and channeling or gathering flow C onto conveyor <b>64</b>. Conveyor <b>86</b> can be suitably driven, for instance, using drive <b>72</b>, or a different drive, as desired or required.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Second conveyor <b>64</b> is preferably a belt type conveyor, inclined at a relatively steep angle of between about 40 and 70 degrees, to use with a taller upstanding wall structure <b>38</b>. Conveyor <b>64</b> utilizes a slatted endless belt <b>88</b> encircling rollers <b>90</b> at the lower first end and an upper second end of conveyor <b>64</b>, and is pivotally mounted at the lower end to trailer <b>34</b> or other suitable structure of device <b>32</b>, by a pivot joint <b>92</b>, coaxial with or adjacent to the lower roller <b>90</b>, for movement through the range of positions denoted by arrow D. The slats of belt <b>88</b> will have sufficient extent for conveying the cobs in the desired manner, and belt <b>88</b> will be driven with sufficient speed to handle the cob flow Cl, which can vary as a function of the sized of the header of combine <b>20</b>, e.g., 5 row to 12 row, and to propel the cobs the required extent into chamber <b>40</b> for achieving desired distribution. To provide these capabilities, conveyor <b>64</b> is suitable driven by a drive <b>94</b>, which can be, for instance, a fluid or electric motor, chain or belt drive, or the like. To move conveyor <b>64</b> through range of positions D, it is supported for pivotal movement by a suitable actuator <b>96</b>, which can be, but is not limited to, a fluid cylinder <b>96</b> extendable for pivotally raising the conveyor, and retractable for lowering it. Actuator <b>96</b> can be controlled by a human operator, for instance from an operator cab of combine <b>20</b>, or a remote location, or automatically, as desired or required for achieving desired distribution of cobs within chamber <b>40</b> of wall structure <b>38</b>. In this regard, a more elevated position of conveyor <b>64</b> will typically be used for distributing flow Cl of cobs within chamber <b>40</b> closer to front wall <b>42</b>, whereas a lower elevation will be used for distributing the flow of cobs closer to the rear end of the chamber, and middle positions will distribute the cobs in a middle region of the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As noted above, to facilitate positioning of conveyor <b>64</b> for distributing the flow of cobs toward the rear end of the chamber, aperture <b>46</b> in front wall <b>42</b> of wall structure <b>38</b> is provided for receiving the upper end of conveyor <b>64</b>. As also noted, the upper end of conveyor <b>64</b> is also receivable in a maximum lowered or stowed position within aperture <b>46</b> to reduce the overall height of the conveyor and thus device <b>32</b>, to facilitate travel under utility lines, bridges and through doorways of buildings. However, it has been found that if aperture <b>46</b> is open but conveyor <b>64</b> is not in its lowest position, if the level of cobs within chamber <b>40</b> is sufficiently high, cobs can be lost through the lower region of the aperture. To prevent this occurrence, front wall <b>42</b> preferably includes a door, such as, but not limited to, pivoting door <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) or sliding door <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) automatically operable for following movements of door <b>48</b> or <b>50</b> as it moves through its range of positions, so as to cover the region of aperture <b>46</b> beneath the door.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To provide a following capability, door, e.g., <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, is preferably biased upwardly toward conveyor <b>64</b>. This can be accomplished in any suitable manner, such as, but not limited to, by use of yieldable biasing elements <b>98</b> such as tension springs or the like connected to door <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> at connections <b>100</b> and connected to suitable structure on wall structure <b>38</b> at connections <b>102</b>, which elements <b>98</b> operate to urge door <b>48</b> or <b>50</b> upwardly against and in following relation to the bottom of conveyor <b>64</b>, as denoted by arrows F. Here, for illustrative purposes, door <b>48</b> is shown connected to wall <b>42</b> by a hinge joint <b>104</b>, and door <b>50</b> is supported for vertical movement by rollers <b>106</b> connected thereto and captured within vertical opposing C shape channels <b>108</b> on opposite sides of aperture <b>46</b>, to provide the required range of movement of the respective door <b>48</b> or <b>50</b> for opening to the necessary extent.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">To also facilitate a smooth following capability, the lower region of conveyor <b>64</b> can include suitable apparatus for contacting door <b>48</b> or <b>50</b>, such as rollers <b>110</b> or a skid plate <b>112</b>. And, in the latter regard, door <b>50</b> is shown including a roller <b>114</b> positioned to engage skid <b>112</b> for smoother movement therebetween. Here, it should be noted that skid plate <b>112</b> is spaced below sufficiently below belt <b>88</b> to allow passage of the slats of the belt thereover. Here also, it should be understood that a wide variety of different door structures could be used in cooperation with conveyor <b>64</b> for limiting cob loss through aperture <b>46</b>, including, but not limited to, accordion or folding doors, roll type doors, and flexible fabric doors, and thus the present invention is not to be interpreted as being limited to the door constructions shown.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, it will be required from time to time to unload the cobs from wall structure <b>38</b> of cob collection device <b>32</b>, and structure <b>38</b> can be configured in a variety of ways for achieving this. As a non-limiting example, wall structure <b>32</b> can comprise a basket of a desired height, width and length, e.g., about equal in height to combine <b>20</b> with extensions of the grain tank lowered, supported on trailer <b>34</b> by lifting apparatus <b>116</b> of device <b>32</b> disposed at each end. Lifting apparatus <b>116</b> can comprise devices such as fluid cylinders <b>118</b> for raising or lifting structure <b>32</b> filled with cobs to a suitable height for unloading, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Device <b>32</b> can also include tilting apparatus <b>120</b> operable for tilting structure <b>38</b> for unloading, such as a fluid motor disposed on lifting apparatus <b>116</b> and operable for rotating a pinion of a rotary rack and pinion mechanism <b>122</b>. Structure <b>38</b> can also include an unload door <b>124</b> movable to an open position by an actuator <b>126</b>, which can also comprise one or more fluid cylinders or the like, for guiding a flow of cobs sidewardly and outwardly away from trailer <b>34</b> as the structure is unloaded. Here, referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</figref>, conveyor system <b>52</b> is configurable such that second conveyor <b>64</b> is movable to a position spaced from structure <b>38</b>, to allow free upward and downward movement thereof between its cob receiving and unloading positions. Here, it should be noted that the device of the present invention can include a variety of other raise and tip type unloading cob holding structures, as well as others such as simple tilt unload configurations capable of transport under bridges, utilities, doorways, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, although device <b>32</b> is discussed above as configured for receiving just cobs and other crop residue from the cleaning system of combine <b>20</b>, combine <b>20</b> can alternatively be configured for directing crop residue from threshing system <b>22</b> to device <b>32</b>, as illustrated by arrangement in a conventional windrowing mode, wherein deflector panels in the rear of the combine are configured essentially to cause crop residue to bypass the spreader and flow onto first conveyor <b>60</b>, as denoted by arrow W. As an example, this configuration could be used for applications wherein the threshing system of a combine is configured for directing cobs to the rear of the combine as opposed to the cleaning system.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Thus, it is apparent that the cob collection device <b>32</b> illustrated includes a conveyor system <b>52</b> operable for positively removing or cleaning attached husks from cobs after removal of corn therefrom by the combine <b>20</b> or another harvester, the conveyor system including an upwardly inclined conveyor <b>64</b> operably movable for distributing the de-husked cobs within a chamber <b>40</b> of a wall structure <b>38</b>, and the conveyor system being positionable for allowing unloading of the wall structure, and stowable in cooperation therewith in a compacted manner to facilitate travel under bridges, utility wires, doorways and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be understood that changes in the details, materials, steps, and arrangements of parts which have been described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention will occur to and may be made by those skilled in the art upon a reading of this disclosure within the principles and scope of the invention. The foregoing description illustrates the preferred embodiment of the invention; however, concepts, as based upon the description, may be employed in other embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the following claims are intended to protect the invention broadly as well as in the specific form shown.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">This invention is directed to a system and method for partitioning a patient's heart chamber into a productive portion and a non-productive portion which are particularly suitable for treating patients with congestive heart failure. The partitioning system has a plurality of partitioning devices with reinforced, expandable membranes which separate the productive and non-productive portions of the heart chamber. When deployed within the patient's heart chamber, the second partitioning device is off-set from the deployed first partitioning device to cover a region of the wall defining the patient's heart chamber which is not covered by the first partitioning device. The multiple partitioning devices may be independent from each other or may be interconnected, e.g. a tether or strand.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the treatment of a patient's heart, particularly congestive heart failure by partitioning a chamber of the patient's heart.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Congestive heart failure (CHF) is characterized by a progressive enlargement of the heart, particularly the left ventricle and is a major cause of death and disability in the United States. Approximately 550,000 new cases occur annually in the U.S. alone. As the patient's heart enlarges, it cannot efficiently pump blood forward with each heart beat. In time, the heart becomes so enlarged the heart becomes ineffective as a pump and cannot adequately supply blood to the body. Even in healthy hearts only a certain percentage of the blood in a patient's left ventricle is pumped out or ejected from the chamber during each stroke of the heart. The pumped percentage, commonly referred to as the &#x201c;ejection fraction&#x201d;, is typically about sixty percent for a healthy heart. A patient with congestive heart failure can have an ejection fraction of less than 40% and sometimes much lower. As a result of the low ejection fraction, a patient with congestive heart failure is fatigued, unable to perform even simple tasks requiring exertion and experiences shortness of breath and discomfort. Further, as the heart enlarges, the internal heart valves such as the mitral valve cannot adequately close. An incompetent mitral valve allows regurgitation of blood from the left ventricle back into the left atrium, further reducing the heart's ability to pump blood forwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Congestive heart failure can result from a variety of conditions, including viral infections, incompetent heart valves (e.g. mitral valve), ischemic conditions in the heart wall or a combination of these conditions. Prolonged ischemia and occlusion of coronary arteries can result in a portion of the ventricular wall dying and becoming scar tissue. Once the myocardial tissue dies, it is less contractile (sometimes non-contractile) and no longer contributes to the pumping action of the heart. It is referred to as hypokinetic or akinetic. As the disease progresses, a local area of compromised myocardium may bulge out during the heart contractions, further decreasing the heart's ability to pump blood and further reducing the ejection fraction. In this instance, the heart wall is referred to as dyskinetic. The dyskinetic region of the heart wall may stretch and eventually form an aneurysmic bulge.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patients suffering from congestive heart failure are commonly grouped into four classes, Classes I, II, III and IV. In the early stages, Classes I and II, drug therapy is presently the most common treatment. Drug therapy typically treats the symptoms of the disease and may slow the progression of the disease, but it can not cure the disease. Presently, the only permanent treatment for congestive heart disease is heart transplantation, but heart transplant procedures are very risky, extremely invasive and expensive and are performed on a small percentage of patients. Many patient's do not qualify for heart transplant for failure to meet any one of a number of qualifying criteria, and, furthermore, there are not enough hearts available for transplant to meet the needs of CHF patients who do qualify.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Substantial effort has been made to find alternative treatments for congestive heart disease. For example, surgical procedures have been developed to dissect and remove weakened portions of the ventricular wall in order to reduce heart volume. This procedure is highly invasive, risky and expensive and is commonly only done in conjunction with other procedures (such as heart valve replacement or coronary artery by-pass graft). Additionally, the surgical treatment is usually only offered to Class III and IV patients and, accordingly, is not an option for most patients facing ineffective drug treatment. Finally, if the procedure fails, emergency heart transplant is the only presently available option.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Mechanical assist devices have been developed as intermediate procedures for treating congestive heart disease. Such devices include left ventricular assist devices and total artificial hearts. A left ventricular assist device includes a mechanical pump for increasing blood flow from the left ventricle into the aorta. Total artificial heart devices, such as the Jarvik heart, are usually used only as temporary measures while a patient awaits a donor heart for transplant.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recently, improvements have been made in treating patient's with CHF by implanting pacing leads in both sides of the heart in order to coordinate the contraction of both ventricles of the heart. This technique has been shown to improve hemodynamic performance and can result in increased ejection fraction from the right ventricle to the patient's lungs and the ejection fraction from the left ventricle to the patient's aorta. While this procedure has been found to be successful in providing some relief from CHF symptoms and slowed the progression of the disease, it has not been able to stop the disease and is only indicated in patients with ventricular dissynchrony.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other efforts to treat CHF include the use of an elastic support, such as an artificial elastic sock, placed around the heart to prevent further deleterious remodeling.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is directed to a method and system for using a plurality of ventricular partitioning devices in the treatment of a patient's heart for disorders such as congestive heart failure (CHF). Specifically, the multiple devices are deployed within a patient's heart chamber so as to partition the heart chamber into a main productive portion and a secondary non-productive portion as described in copending application Ser. No. 10/913,608, filed on Aug. 5, 2004. This partitioning reduces the total volume of the heart chamber, reduces the stress applied to the heart and, as a result, improves the ejection fraction and blood flow thereof. Multiple partitioning devices are deployed when one partitioning device is of a size or shape which is insufficient to cover damaged heart tissue within the heart wall defining the chamber to be partitioned.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One first partitioning device embodying features of the invention has a reinforced partitioning component with a pressure receiving surface which defines in part the main productive portion of the partitioned heart chamber when secured within the patient's heart chamber and a distally depending support member for engaging a region of the patient's heart wall defining in part the non-productive portion of the chamber of the partitioned heart. A suitable first partitioning device is described in copending application Ser. No. 10/913,608, filed on Aug. 5, 2004, and Ser. No. 11/151,164 filed Jun. 10, 2006.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second partitioning device is similar to the first but is configured to fit over and preferably off-set from the first partitioning device to cover damaged areas of the patient's heart wall that may not be effectively covered by the first partitioning device. The second partitioning device embodying features of the invention is similar to the first partitioning device and has a reinforced partitioning component with a pressure receiving surface which helps partition the heart chamber into the main productive portion and non-productive portion when secured within the patient's heart chamber. The second partitioning device may be an independent device, may be tethered or otherwise connected or secured to the first partitioning device, or may be secured to the first partitioning device when deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first and second partitioning devices preferably have a reinforced membrane that forms the pressure receiving surface. The membranes of the devices are reinforced by a radially expandable frame component formed of a plurality of ribs. The ribs of the expandable frames have distal ends secured to central hubs and the free proximal ends thereof configured to engage and preferably penetrate tissue of the heart wall. The secured distal ends of the ribs are preferably configured to facilitate radial self expansion of the free proximal ends of the ribs away from a centerline axis upon deployment within the heart chamber. The distal ends of the ribs may be biased outwardly or fixed to the hub and formed of material such as superelastic NiTi alloy which allows for compressing the free proximal ends of the ribs toward a centerline axis into a contracted configuration for delivery through a delivery catheter and, when released from the compression within the delivery catheter after deployment within the patient's heart chamber, allow for their self expansion to an expanded configuration within the chamber. Alternative designs such as described in applications referred to herein may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The free proximal ends of the ribs are configured to engage and preferably penetrate the tissue lining the heart chamber to be partitioned so as to secure the peripheral edges of the partitioning devices to the heart wall and fix the partitioning component within the chamber so as to partition the chamber in a desired manner. The tissue penetrating proximal tips are configured to penetrate the tissue lining at an angle approximately perpendicular to a center line axis of the partitioning device (e.g. &#xb1;30&#xb0; from a line perpendicular to the center line axis). The tissue penetrating proximal tips of the ribs may be provided with barbs, hooks and the like which anchor the tips within the heart wall and prevent their withdrawal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The ribs in their expanded configuration angle outwardly from the hub and the free proximal ends curve outwardly so that the membrane secured to the ribs of the expanded frame forms a trumpet-shaped, pressure receiving surface.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The partitioning membrane in the expanded configuration has radial dimensions from about 10 to about 160 mm, preferably about 50 to about 100 mm, as measured from the center line axis.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The partitioning device may be delivered percutaneously or intraoperatively. Suitable delivery catheters are described in copending application Ser. No. 10/913,608, filed on Aug. 5, 2004, and Ser. No. 11/151,164 filed Jun. 10, 2005.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The partitioning devices embodying features of the invention are relatively easy to install and they substantially improve the pumping action of the heart and provide an increase in the ejection fraction of the patient's heart chamber. These and other advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the invention and the accompanying exemplary drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a pair of partitioning devices <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> which are secured within a patient's heart chamber <b>60</b> (left ventricle) to partition the heart chamber into a productive portion <b>61</b> and a non-productive portion <b>62</b>. The first partitioning device <b>10</b> is deployed at the apex of the heart chamber <b>60</b> and the second partitioning device <b>30</b> is deployed on top of the first device at a slight angle with respect to the first partitioning device to cover a damaged or weakened region <b>63</b> of the heart wall and define at least in part an additional non-productive portion <b>64</b> of the patient's heart chamber. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the first and second partitioning devices <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> have essentially the same design and are independent from each other. The physician or other operating personnel may determine before or during the partitioning procedure that the first partitioning device <b>10</b> by itself will not adequately partition the heart chamber <b>60</b> and that a second partitioning device <b>30</b> may be needed to more completely partition the heart chamber as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The second partitioning device <b>30</b> has essentially the same structure as the first partitioning device <b>10</b>, except that the radial dimensions of the second partitioning device <b>30</b> is usually greater than the radial dimensions of the first partitioning device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> illustrate details of the first partitioning device <b>10</b> (and partitioning device <b>30</b> which has essentially the same construction) which includes a partitioning membrane <b>11</b>, a hub <b>12</b>, preferably centrally located on the partitioning device, and a radially expandable reinforcing frame <b>13</b> formed of a plurality of ribs <b>14</b>. Preferably, the partitioning membrane <b>11</b> is secured to the proximal or pressure side of the frame <b>13</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The ribs <b>14</b> have distal ends <b>15</b> which are secured to the hub <b>12</b> and free proximal ends <b>16</b> which are configured to curve or flare away from a center line axis. Radial expansion of the free proximal ends <b>16</b> unfurls the membrane <b>11</b> secured to the frame <b>13</b> so that the membrane defines in part the productive portion of the patient's partitioned heart chamber <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the distal ends <b>15</b> of the ribs <b>14</b> are secured within the hub <b>12</b> and a transversely disposed connector bar <b>20</b> to the non-traumatic support component <b>21</b> and thus the partitioning component <b>10</b> to delivery systems such as shown in copending application Ser. No. 10/913,608, filed on Aug. 5, 2004, and Ser. No. 11/151,164 filed Jun. 10, 2005. The curved free proximal ends <b>16</b> of ribs <b>14</b> are provided with sharp tip elements <b>17</b> which are configured to hold the frame <b>13</b> and the membrane <b>11</b> secured thereto in a deployed position within the patient's heart chamber. Preferably, the sharp tip elements <b>17</b> of the frame <b>13</b> penetrate into tissue of the patient's heart wall in order to secure the partitioning component <b>10</b> within the heart chamber so as to partition the ventricular chamber into a productive portion and a non-productive portion.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The connector bar <b>20</b> of the hub <b>12</b> allows the partitioning device <b>10</b> to be secured to the non-traumatic component <b>21</b> which can be secured to a delivery system for delivery and to be released from the delivery system within the patient's heart chamber for deployment. The distal ends <b>15</b> of the reinforcing ribs <b>14</b> are secured within the hub <b>12</b> in a suitable manner or they may be secured to the surface defining the inner lumen or they may be disposed within channels or bores in the wall of the hub <b>12</b>. The ribs <b>14</b> are preshaped so that when not constrained other than by the membrane <b>11</b> secured thereto (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>), the free proximal ends <b>16</b> thereof expand to a desired angular displacement away from a center line axis which is about 20&#xb0; to about 90&#xb0;, preferably about 50&#xb0; to about 80&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A non-traumatic support component <b>21</b> is secured to the hub <b>12</b> and has a stem <b>22</b> and a plurality of feet or pods <b>23</b> extending radially away from the center line axis. The ends of the feet <b>23</b> are secured to struts <b>24</b> which extend between adjacent feet. A plane of material (not shown) may extend between adjacent feet <b>23</b> in a web-like fashion to provide further support in addition to or in lieu of the struts <b>24</b>. The inner diameter of the stem <b>22</b> is threaded to secure the partitioning device <b>10</b> to a delivery catheter as disclosed in previously discussed copending application Ser. No. 10/913,608 and application Ser. No. 11/151,164.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, illustrates the deployment of the first partitioning device <b>10</b> and an alternative second partitioning device <b>40</b> within a patient's heart chamber. The alternative second partitioning device <b>40</b> has a shortened support component <b>41</b> which has a rounded distal tip <b>42</b>. It has no stem or a shortened stem with no feet as shown with the second partitioning device <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The second partitioning device <b>40</b> covers additional region <b>43</b> of the heart wall and defines in part non-productive portion <b>44</b> of the heart chamber <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</figref> illustrates the deployment of the first partitioning device <b>10</b> and another second alternative partitioning device <b>50</b>. The second alternative partitioning device <b>50</b> has a support component <b>51</b> configured to extend through an aperture (not shown) in the membrane <b>11</b> of the first partitioning device <b>10</b>. The support component <b>51</b> has a helical coil <b>52</b> to facilitate securing the second partitioning device <b>50</b> to a region of the membrane <b>11</b> or a rib <b>14</b> of the first partitioning device <b>10</b>. The second alternative partitioning device <b>50</b> covers region <b>54</b> of the heart wall and defines in part non-productive portion <b>55</b> of the heart chamber <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, illustrates the deployment of the first partitioning device <b>10</b> and another alternative second partitioning device <b>70</b>. The alternative second partitioning device <b>70</b> has a support component <b>71</b> with a distally depending support stem <b>72</b> with a helical coil <b>73</b> on the distal end of the stem to facilitate attachment of the stem to an underlying region of the patient's heart wall. The stem passes through an aperture (not shown) provided in the membrane <b>11</b> of the first partitioning device <b>10</b>. This arrangement also allows the deployment of the second partitioning device <b>70</b> off-set from the first partitioning device <b>10</b> to cover a greater region <b>74</b> of the patient's heart wall and define in part non-productive portion <b>75</b> of the heart chamber <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates deployment of the first partitioning device <b>10</b> and another alternative second partitioning device <b>80</b> which has a support component <b>81</b> similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> but with an elongated tether or strand <b>82</b> which has one end secured to the support component <b>81</b> and extends to and is secured to the hub <b>12</b> of the partitioning device <b>10</b>. The tether or strand <b>82</b> may be formed of a suitable biocompatible polymeric fabric. Strand <b>82</b> may also be in the form of a helical coil and have a bias to maintain the length of the tether extending between the first and second partitioning devices. The second partitioning device <b>80</b> covers region <b>83</b> of the patient's heart wall and defines in part non-production portion <b>84</b> of the heart chamber <b>60</b>. Alternatively, a tether <b>82</b>&#x2032; extending between the first and second partitioning devices may be in the form of a tubular element as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Over time, the non-productive portions <b>44</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>75</b> and <b>84</b> of the heart chamber <b>60</b> fill first with thrombus and subsequently with cellular growth. Bio-resorbable fillers such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polycaprolactone and copolymers and blends may be employed to initially fill the non-productive portions. Other materials which accelerate tissue growth or thrombus may be deployed in the non-productive portions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The partitioning devices may be conveniently formed by the methods described in previously discussed copending application Ser. No. 10/913,608.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">While porous ePTFE material is preferred membrane material, the membrane <b>11</b> may be formed of suitable biocompatible polymeric material which include Nylon, PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and polyesters such as Hytrel. The membrane <b>11</b> is preferably foraminous in nature to facilitate tissue ingrowth after deployment within the patient's heart.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">To the extent not otherwise described herein, the various components of the partitioning devices may be formed of conventional materials and in a conventional manner as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/478,763, titled Fluid Injection Port For Adjustable Gastric Band, filed on Jun. 16, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This application also incorporates by reference the following co-pending U.S. patent applications filed of even date herewith: application Ser. No. 10/741,127 (Subcutaneous Injection Port For Applied Fasteners, investors: Conlon and Hunt); and application Ser. No. 10/741,868 (Subcutaneous Self Attaching Injection Port With Integral Fasteners, inventors: Conlon and Kolata).</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to surgically implantable fluid injection ports, and is particularly directed to fasteners and methods for fastening subcutaneous peripherally attached ports. The invention will be specifically disclosed in connection with injection ports used with adjustable gastric bands, although the fasteners of the present invention may be used with many different subcutaneously attached devices, including injection ports used for vascular access such as the infusion of medications and blood draws.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Injection ports are placed beneath the skin of a body for injecting fluids into the body, such as for infusing medication, blood draws, and many other applications, including adjustable gastric bands. Since the early 1980s, adjustable gastric bands have provided an effective alternative to gastric bypass and other irreversible surgical weight loss treatments for the morbidly obese. The gastric band is wrapped around an upper portion of the patient's stomach, forming a stoma that restricts food passing from an upper portion to a lower portion of the stomach. When the stoma is of the appropriate size, food held in the upper portion of the stomach provides a feeling of fullness that discourages overeating. However, initial maladjustment or a change in the stomach over time may lead to a stoma of an inappropriate size, warranting an adjustment of the gastric band. Otherwise, the patient may suffer vomiting attacks and discomfort when the stoma is too small to reasonably pass food. At the other extreme, the stoma may be too large and thus fail to slow food moving from the upper portion of the stomach, defeating the purpose altogether for the gastric hand.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to a latched position to set the outer diameter of the gastric band, adjustability of gastric bands is generally achieved with an inwardly directed inflatable balloon, similar to a blood pressure cuff, into which fluid, such as saline, is injected through a fluid injection port to achieve a desired diameter. Since adjustable gastric bands may remain in the patient for long periods of time, the fluid injection port is typically installed subcutaneously to avoid infection, for instance in front of the sternum. Adjusting the amount of fluid in the adjustable gastric band is achieved by inserting a Huber needle through the skin into a silicon septum of the injection port. Once the needle is removed, the septum seals against the hole by virtue of compressive load generated by the septum. A flexible conduit communicates between the injection port and the adjustable gastric band.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The traditional surgical technique for securing a fluid injection port developed for vascular uses has been applying sutures through a series of holes spaced about a peripheral base flange. While generally effective, suturing often proves to be difficult and time consuming, even more so with adjustable gastric band which are intended for the morbidly obese. A significant thickness of fat tissue may underlie the skin, causing difficulties as the surgeon attempts to apply sutures to deeply recessed tissues (e.g., 5-10 cm) to secure the port, often requiring 10-15 minutes to complete. Further, if the injection port is not sutured properly, the port may flip over, making subsequent injections difficult or impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, a surgical stapler has been described in a German patent application No. 197 51 791.9 to Pier wherein a hat-shaped injection port includes tangentially aligned linear grooves spaced around its perimeter. A pair of holes in each linear groove receives a traditional bent wire staple. A stapler holds the staples in place and has downwardly moving forming member that presses upon the shoulders of each staple. Due to the position of the holes in the linear groove, pointed ends of the staple are deformed inwardly to grip underlying tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This Pier stapler thus attaches the staples through a deformation that may prove difficult to release should the initial placement be undesirable or removal of the gastric band be appropriate. Further, because the device must permanently deform a multiplicity of stainless steel or titanium staples, a more complicated mechanism is required to provide the surgeon with enough mechanical advantage to form the staples easily. The Pier injection port also requires a custom stapler handle that is not useful for any other purpose, which may be an undesirable expense for surgeons who do not perform numerous placements of the Pier injection port.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While a custom stapler for an injection port may have advantages over suturing, such as the time required to accomplish the attachment, it is believed that other approaches to attaching an injection port may have additional advantages or features not provided by traditional suturing or a stapler using bent wire staples.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Consequently, a significant need exists for a fluid injection port suitable for subcutaneous attachment that is quickly attachable yet is secure over a long period of time.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described herein, there is provided an injection port for injecting fluids into a body. The port includes a housing for placement beneath the skin of the body and means for receiving a needle. At least one retention member is integrally attached to the housing which is moveable with respect thereto. The retention member has an undeployed state when disposed in a first position relative to the housing and a deployed state engaging tissue adjacent the housing when disposed in a second position relative to the housing.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiment of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to the drawings in detail, wherein like numerals indicate the same elements throughout the views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, adjustable gastric band <b>10</b> is shown wrapped around an upper portion of stomach <b>12</b>, kept in place by attaching the two ends together and extending portion <b>14</b> of the stomach <b>12</b> over adjustable gastric band <b>10</b> by suturing portion <b>14</b> to the stomach. One end of flexible conduit <b>16</b> is in fluid communication with the internal cavity of the balloon (not shown), with the other end being in fluid communication with an internal cavity of injection port <b>18</b>. At the time adjustable gastric band <b>10</b> is implanted around a portion of the stomach, remote injection port <b>18</b> is also implanted at a suitable location, usually within the rectus sheaths, for transcutaneous access via a Huber needle.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, as is well known, injection port <b>18</b> includes housing <b>20</b> having annular flange <b>22</b> extending outwardly from one end and a metal base member <b>27</b>. Septum <b>28</b> and metal base member <b>27</b> cooperate to form a sealed plenum chamber, which is depicted as an internal cavity <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Nipple <b>24</b> is in fluid communication with internal cavity <b>26</b>. Flexible conduit <b>16</b> is attached to nipple <b>24</b> at some point in the procedure, typically after injection port <b>18</b> has been implanted. Fluid is added to or removed from interior cavity <b>26</b> by inserting a Huber needle percutaneously into silicone septum <b>28</b> of injection port <b>18</b>. Although septum <b>26</b> is made of silicon, the means of the injection port for receiving a needle includes any structure configured to self seal after puncture with a non-coring needle.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although a specific configuration for injection port <b>18</b> is disclosed herein, there are many suitable configurations which may be used in conjunction with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, injection port <b>18</b> includes three integral rotatable circumferentially spaced retention members/fasteners <b>30</b>, each of which is rotatably carried by a respective pin <b>32</b>. Each fastener <b>30</b> is disposed to rotate in a respective radial plane, about a respective tangential axis. Each pin <b>32</b> is supported by a respective fastener support <b>34</b> which is carried by flange <b>22</b>. For each fastener support <b>34</b>, portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of flange <b>22</b> extends generally radially outward, with a pair of spaced apart upright flanges <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b</i>, defining a gap therebetween, extending upwardly relative to top surface <b>22</b><i>b </i>of flange portion <b>22</b><i>a</i>, adjacent either side of slot <b>36</b>. Recesses <b>36</b><i>a </i>may be formed into the side of housing <b>20</b> if necessary to provide clearance for rotation of rotatable retention members <b>30</b>. Fastener supports <b>34</b> may be of unitary construction with flange <b>22</b>, or may be mounted thereon in any suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Each flange <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>includes a respective mutually aligned hole into which pin <b>32</b> is pressed with an interference fit sufficient to retain pin <b>32</b> therein. In the depicted embodiment, ribs <b>38</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b </i>extend from the facing inner surfaces of flanges <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b</i>, and bear against fasteners <b>30</b> to keep them from rotating freely so that fasteners <b>30</b> may be kept a non-deployed state until implantation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Flange <b>22</b> includes two circumferentially spaced recesses <b>40</b> (only one of which is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Flange <b>22</b> includes a stepped/raised portion <b>22</b><i>c </i>overlying recess <b>40</b>. It is noted that recess <b>40</b> may be formed in flange <b>22</b> without including raised portion <b>22</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The teachings of this invention may be practiced with any suitable configuration of a injection port, such as having a smaller flange or a discontinuous flange. Three fasteners <b>30</b> are effective to prevent injection port <b>18</b> from flipping over after implantation, such as due to passive or induced movements of the patient. However, the present invention is not limited to the use of three fasteners, and one or more fasteners may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, rotatable retention member <b>30</b> is formed as a hook, having an arm <b>30</b><i>a </i>extending from base portion <b>30</b><i>b </i>to arcuate portion <b>30</b><i>c</i>. Arcuate portion <b>30</b><i>c </i>terminates in tip <b>30</b><i>d </i>which is sharp enough to penetrate tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate injection port assembly <b>42</b> with injection port <b>18</b> installed in applicator subassembly <b>44</b>. Applicator subassembly <b>44</b> includes base <b>46</b> and plunger <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, base <b>46</b> includes handle portion <b>50</b>, which can be any suitable configuration, and tubular housing portion <b>52</b>. End <b>54</b> includes recesses <b>56</b> dimensioned and shaped to receive fastener supports <b>34</b> and portions <b>22</b><i>a</i>. Each recess includes slot portion <b>56</b><i>a </i>which provides clearance for rotatable retention member <b>30</b>. End <b>54</b> also includes recess <b>58</b>, which provides clearance for nipple <b>24</b> when injection port <b>18</b> is installed in applicator subassembly <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Base <b>46</b> includes two circumferentially spaced resilient retention members <b>60</b>, each defined by two respective elongated slots <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b</i>. Each pair of slots <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are circumferentially spaced a distance such that retention members <b>60</b> are essentially cantilevered springs which may be deflected outwardly to release injection port <b>18</b>, as will be described below. Extending from each longitudinal edge of each retention member <b>60</b> near end <b>60</b><i>a </i>is a respective retention member actuator <b>64</b><i>a </i>and <b>64</b><i>b</i>. End <b>60</b><i>a </i>includes an inwardly extending lip <b>60</b><i>b</i>. The arcuate width, height and depth of recess <b>40</b> are complementary to the corresponding dimensions of lip <b>60</b><i>b</i>, such that lip <b>60</b><i>b </i>engages recess <b>40</b> to thereby retain injection port <b>18</b> at end <b>54</b> of base <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, plunger <b>48</b> includes shaft portion <b>66</b> and cylindrical portion <b>68</b>, both of which are shaped and sized complementary to corresponding portions of base <b>46</b> so as to be axially moveably received therein. End <b>70</b> of cylindrical portion <b>68</b> is configured to complementarily engage flange <b>22</b>, and includes axial recesses <b>72</b><i>a </i>and <b>72</b><i>b </i>which align with raised portion <b>22</b><i>c</i>. End <b>70</b> may alternatively be flat, if the configuration of flange <b>22</b> dictates. Cylindrical portion <b>68</b> defines cavity <b>74</b> which is shaped to receive injection port <b>18</b> without interfering with the desired engagement between end <b>70</b> and flange <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Cylindrical portion <b>68</b> includes pairs of spaced apart, outwardly extending actuators <b>76</b><i>a </i>and <b>76</b><i>b</i>. Actuators <b>76</b><i>a </i>and <b>76</b><i>b </i>are depicted as ramps, having inclined leading surfaces <b>78</b><i>a </i>and <b>78</b><i>b </i>and declined trailing surfaces <b>80</b> and <b>80</b><i>b</i>. When plunger <b>48</b> is disposed within base <b>46</b>, each actuator <b>76</b><i>a </i>and <b>76</b><i>b </i>is disposed within a respective slot <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b</i>. As will be described below, as plunger is depressed to advance end <b>70</b> toward end <b>54</b>, actuators <b>76</b><i>a </i>and <b>76</b><i>b </i>engage respective resilient member actuators <b>64</b><i>a </i>and <b>64</b><i>b </i>and urge them outwardly, causing resilient members <b>60</b> to move outwardly, and eventually moving lips <b>60</b><i>b </i>out of respective recesses <b>22</b><i>c</i>, releasing injection port <b>18</b> from applicator subassembly <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates applicator subassembly <b>44</b> in cross section. Base <b>46</b> includes bore <b>82</b> into which shaft portion <b>66</b> is slidably disposed. Plunger <b>48</b> is retained in base <b>46</b> by pin <b>84</b> which is secured to base <b>46</b>, and extends into longitudinal slot <b>86</b> in shaft portion <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 11</figref>, injection port assembly <b>42</b> is illustrated, having injection port <b>18</b> installed in applicator subassembly <b>44</b>. Fasteners <b>30</b> are in the retracted position in an undeployed state. End <b>66</b><i>a </i>of shaft <b>66</b> extends out of handle portion <b>50</b> as shown. To assemble injection port <b>18</b> into applicator assembly <b>44</b>, fastener supports <b>34</b> are aligned with openings <b>56</b>, and snapped into place with lips <b>60</b><i>b </i>engaging recesses <b>22</b><i>c</i>. To keep plunger <b>48</b> in place, lock clip <b>88</b> engages annular groove <b>90</b> in shaft portion <b>66</b>. To implant injection port <b>18</b>, clip <b>88</b> is removed and shaft portion <b>66</b> is advanced through bore <b>82</b>, contacting fasteners <b>30</b> and rotating them into the deployed state at a position piercing and engaging fascia layer <b>92</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Further advancement of shaft portion <b>66</b> will disengage injection port <b>18</b> from applicator subassembly <b>48</b>, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a cross sectional view of the injection port attachment assembly taken along line <b>13</b>-<b>13</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. At this position, end <b>70</b> has rotated rotatable retention members/fasteners <b>30</b> about 90&#xb0; from their retracted position in an undeployed state, by initially contacting fasteners <b>30</b> at their uppermost point in the retracted position. This creates a moment about pin <b>32</b>, rotating fasteners <b>30</b>, and transmitting sufficient force thereto to pierce the fascia layer. Full rotation of fasteners <b>30</b> into the deployed state is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, although at this position end <b>70</b> has not bottomed against the upper surface of flange <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, which is an enlarged illustration of a portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, showing resilient retention member <b>60</b> still maintaining lip <b>60</b><i>b </i>in recess <b>40</b>. Also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, at the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, ramp actuators <b>76</b><i>a </i>and <b>76</b><i>b </i>are in contact with retention member actuators <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>(<b>62</b><i>b </i>and <b>76</b><i>b </i>are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). Longitudinal advancement of plunger <b>66</b> causes retention member actuators <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>to ride up ramps <b>78</b><i>a </i>and <b>78</b><i>b</i>, urging resilient retention members <b>60</b> outwardly. As plunger <b>66</b> advances, portions of end <b>70</b> engage flange <b>22</b>, and begin urging injection port <b>18</b> axially out. When ramps <b>78</b><i>a </i>and <b>78</b><i>b </i>have moved retention members <b>60</b> outwardly enough, lips <b>60</b><i>b </i>move out of recesses <b>40</b> and injection port <b>18</b> is released. Further travel of plunger <b>66</b> pushes flange <b>22</b> past end <b>54</b> of housing <b>52</b>. Slot <b>86</b> bottoms against pin <b>84</b>, preventing further travel of plunger <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a side view of an alternate embodiment of an injection port attachment assembly according the present invention. Injection port attachment assembly <b>94</b> includes handle portion <b>96</b> which is rotatable relative to cylindrical portion <b>98</b>. Handle portion <b>96</b> includes grip <b>100</b> connected to shaft <b>102</b>. In addition to the configuration of handle portion, injection port attachment assembly <b>94</b> differs from <b>42</b> injection port attachment assembly <b>94</b> in that it has four equally circumferentially spaced rotatable retention members <b>104</b> (see FIG. <b>18</b>), and in the configuration of the retention member actuators and the actuator ramp.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, plunger <b>106</b> includes two diametrically opposite resilient retention member actuators <b>108</b>. Resilient retention members <b>110</b> are disposed diametrically opposite each other since there are four rotatable retention members <b>104</b>. If only three retention members were present, resilient retention members would be disposed as described above. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, resilient retention member <b>110</b> includes ramp actuator <b>112</b>. As plunger <b>106</b> is advanced, actuator <b>108</b> engages ramp <b>112</b>, urging resilient retention members <b>110</b> outwardly and out of engagement with the injection port.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is noted that in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-20</figref>, plunger <b>106</b> bottoms out, after disengaging resilient retention members, without pushing the injection port out. Either embodiment described so far may be configured to push or not to push the injection port out at the end of the plunger stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, there is shown another embodiment of a injection port constructed in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment, injection port <b>114</b> includes a plurality of rotatable retention members/fasteners <b>116</b>, each disposed to rotate in a tangential plane. Rotatable fasteners <b>116</b> are rotatably carried by respective pins <b>118</b> which are pressed radially into flange <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, an additional configuration of rotatable retention members/fasteners <b>116</b><i>a</i>. Fastener <b>116</b><i>a </i>has a generally circular cross section, and includes a generally arcuate portion <b>122</b> which extends higher than end <b>124</b><i>a </i>of arm <b>124</b> is shown. Operation of fasteners <b>116</b> and <b>116</b><i>a </i>is the same.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, applicator <b>126</b> includes shaft <b>128</b> and cylindrical end <b>130</b>. Cavity <b>132</b> forms the center of cylindrical end <b>130</b>, providing clearance for injection port <b>114</b>. Cylindrical end <b>130</b> includes circumferentially spaced openings <b>132</b> which are sized and spaced to align with rotatable retention members <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>, injection port <b>114</b> is implanted by placing it on fascia layer <b>134</b> with fasteners <b>116</b> in the retracted position in an undeployed state. End <b>130</b><i>a </i>of applicator <b>126</b> is placed in contact with flange <b>120</b>, with openings <b>132</b> aligned with fasteners <b>116</b>. With sufficient axial force, shaft <b>128</b> is rotated, urging edges <b>132</b><i>a </i>against fasteners <b>116</b>, causing them to rotate and pierce fascia layer <b>134</b>. Edges <b>132</b><i>a </i>include rounded portions where they transition to end <b>130</b><i>a </i>for smooth engagement with fasteners <b>116</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, injection port <b>114</b> is implanted when recesses <b>132</b> of applicator <b>126</b> have been rotated into the deployed state at the position as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, there is shown another embodiment of an injection port with integral, moveable fasteners. Injection port <b>136</b> includes eight circumferentially spaced fasteners <b>138</b> extending radially outward (four shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>). This embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the use of eight fasteners, and one or more fasteners may be used. Fasteners <b>138</b> extend from and are secured to bottom surface <b>136</b><i>a </i>of the distal end of injection port <b>136</b> in any suitable manner, such as by one end <b>138</b><i>a </i>being pressed, welded, epoxied, or otherwise secured into a blind hole formed in bottom surface <b>136</b><i>a</i>. Distal end <b>138</b><i>b </i>are sharp for tissue penetration.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As depicted, in the undeformed deployed state, each fastener <b>138</b> is a single coil, forming a hook shape, with distal end <b>138</b><i>b </i>disposed touching or otherwise adjacent the side of housing <b>140</b> of injection port <b>136</b>. It is noted that the relative positions of the side of housing <b>140</b> and distal ends <b>138</b><i>b </i>may leave fasteners <b>138</b> in a somewhat deformed state with some stress and strain. Fasteners <b>138</b>, also referred to as radial elements, are flexible, being made of any suitable material. Material having super elastic properties, such as a nickel titanium alloy, for example Nitinol&#xae; wire.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Fasteners <b>138</b> may be of any suitable dimensions. In one example, Nitinol&#xae; wire having a diameter in the range of 0.020-0.080 mm, coiled to a diameter of about 4-8 mm was used.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-31</figref>, implantation of injection port <b>136</b> may be accomplished through use of applier <b>142</b>. Applier <b>142</b> includes plunger <b>144</b> axially reciprocable disposed inside of tube <b>146</b>. End <b>144</b><i>a </i>is shaped complementarily to housing <b>140</b> of plunger <b>144</b>. End <b>146</b><i>a </i>of tube <b>146</b> includes a plurality of circumferentially spaced slots <b>148</b> located complementarily to the spacing of fasteners <b>138</b>. Tube <b>146</b> may include a slot to accommodate the nipple extending from injection port <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, injection port <b>44</b> is initially disposed inside of tube <b>146</b>, spaced up from end <b>146</b><i>a </i>a distance sufficient to orient fasteners <b>138</b> in an undeployed state at a position such that tips <b>138</b><i>b </i>are respectively disposed in slots <b>148</b> without extending outside of the diameter of tube <b>146</b>. The wall thickness of tube <b>146</b> at end <b>146</b><i>a </i>is sufficient to provide adequate length for tips <b>138</b><i>b </i>to remain disposed therein without extending beyond the outer diameter of tube <b>146</b>. Tube <b>146</b> may be uniform along its entire length, or have a thin wall along its length with a thicker wall suction at end <b>146</b><i>a</i>, such as provided by a collar (not illustrated) disposed about end <b>146</b><i>a</i>, to provide the desired radial thickness for slots <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates flexible fasteners <b>138</b> as extending straight between slots <b>148</b> and bottom surface <b>136</b><i>a</i>, fasteners <b>138</b> may assume a curved configuration dictated by their specific physical properties and the distance between slots <b>148</b> and bottom surface <b>136</b><i>a</i>. Slots <b>148</b><i>a </i>are configured to keep fasteners <b>138</b> in a suitable orientation and configuration to feed through slots <b>148</b> as described below. Tube <b>146</b> may be made of any suitable material, such as stainless steel or plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Injection port <b>136</b> may be releasably held in the appropriate location within tube <b>146</b> in any suitable manner. For example, a pin may extend through a hole in tube <b>146</b> to restrain injection port <b>136</b> across bottom <b>1364</b><i>a </i>until implantation; an adequate frictional fit between injection port <b>136</b> and the inside of tube <b>146</b> may be provided, with the tightest fit being at the highest location of injection port <b>136</b> within tube <b>146</b>; end <b>144</b><i>a </i>could be configured to releasably engage injection port <b>44</b>, with plunger <b>144</b> being retained in tube <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">It is contemplated, but not required, that applier <b>142</b> will be provided to the surgeon with injection port <b>136</b> premounted inside of tube <b>144</b> as a sterilized assembly. Implantation of self attaching injection port <b>136</b> is accomplished by urging end <b>146</b><i>a </i>against fascia layer <b>150</b> to depress the tissue surface slightly thereby upraising the tissue so that fasteners <b>138</b> may go through it the surgeon then pushers plunger <b>144</b> to deploy fasteners <b>138</b>, and withdraws tube <b>146</b>. Sharp lips <b>138</b><i>b </i>penetrate through and curl back out of fascia layer <b>150</b>, and stop against the side of housing <b>140</b> to protect tips <b>138</b><i>b</i>. In the deployed state, fasteners <b>138</b> are in a &#x201c;relaxed&#x201d; configuration, having less deformation, and therefore less stress strain, than in the pre-attachment, deformed state.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Deformable fasteners <b>138</b> may be sized to provide holding strength similar to sutures, with the flexibility of fasteners <b>138</b> allowing injection port <b>136</b> to be removed without the tissue being ripped. For example, after attachment, injection port may be reposition by grasping injection port <b>136</b> and pulling it up, uncurling fasteners <b>138</b> in the process. It may then be reinserted into applier <b>142</b> and reimplanted. Applier <b>142</b> may also be used to remove injection port <b>136</b>, such as by configuring end <b>150</b><i>a </i>to engage injection port <b>136</b> to be withdrawn, as tube <b>146</b> is urged against tissue. In such a case, it may be advantageous to provide structure to index plunger <b>144</b> relative to injection port <b>136</b> and slots <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Although flexible fasteners <b>138</b> are illustrated extending from bottom <b>136</b><i>a</i>, this aspect of the present invention may be practiced with fasteners <b>146</b> extending in other directions from injection port <b>136</b>, such as from the side. As will be appreciated, modifications to applicr <b>142</b>, such as a larger diameter to accommodate the circumferential attachment to injection port <b>136</b> for implantation, may be made. It is noted that with flexible fasteners <b>138</b> extending from bottom <b>136</b><i>a</i>, tips <b>138</b><i>a </i>are oriented in a downward pointing undeployed state at a position ready to penetrate the tissue from the top, which allows a smaller diameter than would fasteners extending outwardly from the side. A small diameter applier minimizes the size of the incision, and requires less dissection.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, another embodiment of an injection port having an integral moveable retention member is illustrated. Injection port <b>152</b> includes housing <b>154</b> with annular flange <b>156</b> extending outwardly from the lower distal end of housing <b>154</b>. Annular flange <b>156</b> includes upper surface <b>156</b><i>a </i>and lower surface <b>156</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Hinge <b>158</b> is carried by annular flange <b>156</b>, moveably connecting retention member/fastener <b>160</b> to flange <b>156</b>. Hinge <b>158</b> may be any structure which allows the necessary relative movement between retention member/fastener <b>160</b> and flange <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, retention member <b>160</b> includes upper surface <b>160</b> and lower surface <b>160</b><i>b</i>. Locking member <b>162</b> extends upwardly from upper surface <b>160</b><i>a</i>, and includes distal tip <b>162</b><i>a </i>which is configured to pierce tissue. Locking member <b>162</b> also includes locking configuration <b>162</b><i>b </i>which is configured to engage annular flange <b>156</b> and lock retention member <b>160</b> in a deployed state, as described below. As depicted, locking configuration <b>162</b><i>b </i>includes step <b>162</b><i>c </i>and inclined surface/ramp <b>162</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the embodiment depicted, flange <b>156</b> includes opening <b>164</b> which is shaped complementary to locking member <b>162</b>, configured to receive locking member <b>162</b> and engage step <b>162</b><i>c </i>to maintain locking member <b>162</b> and retention member/fastener <b>160</b> in the deployed state. Locking member <b>162</b> has enough flexibility to allow outward movement of locking member <b>162</b> as inclined surface <b>162</b><i>d </i>engages and advances along corresponding edge <b>164</b><i>a </i>of opening <b>164</b>. Once locking member <b>162</b> has been inserted far enough into opening <b>164</b> for ramp <b>162</b><i>d </i>to disengage with corresponding edge <b>164</b><i>a</i>, step <b>162</b><i>c </i>will clear upper surface <b>156</b><i>a</i>, and the locking member <b>162</b> will move inwardly, with step <b>162</b><i>c </i>engaging upper surface <b>156</b><i>a </i>to resist withdrawal of locking member <b>162</b> from opening <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Alternatively, opening <b>164</b> may open to outer edge <b>156</b><i>c </i>of flange <b>156</b>, or may even be eliminated, with locking member <b>162</b> disposed such that inclined surface <b>162</b><i>d </i>engages and advances along outer edge <b>156</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Locking member <b>162</b> may be made of any suitable material which provides the necessary flexibility, including plastic. Locking member <b>162</b> is not limited to the shape shown, and may be of any shape which is functional to retain retention member <b>162</b> at the position shown in the deployed state. Locking member <b>162</b> and flange <b>156</b> may be configured such that distal tip <b>162</b><i>a </i>does not extend above, or as far above, upper surface <b>154</b><i>a</i>. For example, locking member <b>162</b> could include a stop surface which engages the annular flange <b>156</b> so as to limit the position of distal tip <b>162</b><i>a </i>relative to upper surface <b>156</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Retention member <b>160</b> may also be made of any suitable material, including plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> illustrates retention member <b>160</b>, in the undeployed state. Hinge <b>158</b> may include a detent to hold retention member <b>160</b> in a particular undeployed state position relative to housing <b>154</b>. To implant injection port <b>152</b>, retention member <b>160</b> is inserted below the fascia tissue, with injection port <b>152</b> remaining there above. If necessary, an incision may be made in the tissue sufficient to insert retention member <b>160</b>. Retention member <b>160</b> is moved relative to housing <b>154</b> and flange <b>156</b> into a deployed state, with distal tip <b>162</b><i>a </i>piercing the tissue and engaging opening <b>164</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>.</p>

As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, hinge <b>158</b> is located so as to maintain flange <b>156</b> and retention member <b>160</b> in a spaced apart relationship, creating a gap therebetween within which tissue <b>166</b> may be captured. Alternatively, it may be possible to omit the gap if either flange <b>156</b> or retention member <b>160</b> is flexible enough to so capture tissue <b>166</b> without damage.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Although retention member/fastener <b>160</b> is illustrated as shaped complementary to flange <b>156</b>, retention member/fastener <b>160</b> does not have to have the same shape as flange <b>156</b>.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Global and domestic demand for fossil fuels continues to rise despite price increases and other economic and geopolitical concerns. As such demand continues to rise, research and investigation into finding additional economically viable sources of fossil fuels correspondingly increases. Historically, many have recognized the vast quantities of energy stored in oil shale, coal and tar sand deposits, for example. However, these sources remain a difficult challenge in terms of economically competitive recovery. Canadian tar sands have shown that such efforts can be fruitful, although many challenges still remain, including environmental impact, product quality, and process time, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Estimates of world-wide tar sands reserves generally exceed 5 trillion barrels of oil, depending on the estimating source. Regardless, these reserves represent a tremendous volume and remain a substantially untapped resource. Only Canada and Venezuela currently have significant amounts of commercial production of oil from tar sands. A large number of companies and investigators continue to study and test methods of recovering oil from such reserves. Methods of extraction have included open pit mining or strip mining followed by various extraction and separation techniques and underground in-situ methods.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among tar sand resources, the bitumen and sand arrangement can vary from location to location. For example, Canadian tar sands are water-wetted, i.e. a water envelope around the sand, while U.S. tar sands (predominantly found in Utah) are hydrocarbon wetted. This often demands distinct extraction techniques to address these differences. Hot water extraction is currently the most common extraction process used, although a wide variety has been proposed in the literature and tested on small scale. In situ processes generally include steam injection, steam assisted gravity drainage, solvent injection, cold flow, vapor extraction, or flame front combustion (e.g. toe to heel burning). Unfortunately, current tar sand or oil sand processes require significant amounts of energy and water. High water usage, in particular, can be a critical limiting factor for these processes. As a general rule, these processes require several barrels of water per barrel of petroleum produced. This water is unsuitable for further usage and is deposited in huge drainage and settling ponds. Due to the makeup of this water, including sand particles and processing chemicals, the water is slow to evaporate and thus becomes an environmental problem. Thus, environmental impacts, such as water usage, inability to recycle or otherwise use such water, greenhouse gas emissions, habitat disturbance, and the like can make commercial exploitation of these resources difficult. Methods are needed that accomplish environmental stewardship, yet still provide high volume fuel output.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Below ground in-situ concepts emerged based on their ability to produce high volumes while avoiding the cost of mining. While the cost savings associated with avoiding mining can be achieved, the in-situ method requires heating a formation for a long period of time due to the extremely low permeability of undisturbed formations. Perhaps the most significant challenge for any in-situ process is the uncertainty and long term potential of water contamination that can occur with underground aquifers. In the case of Shell's ICP method which can be applied to tar sands, oil shale or other deposits, a &#x201c;freeze wall&#x201d; is used as a barrier to, in theory, keep separation between aquifers and an underground treatment area. Although this is possible, no long term analysis has proven for extended periods to guarantee the prevention of contamination. Without guarantees and with even fewer remedies should a freeze wall fail, other methods are desirable to address such environmental risks.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For this and other reasons, the need remains for methods and systems which can provide improved recovery of hydrocarbons from suitable water-containing hydrocarbonaceous materials, which have acceptable economics and avoid the drawbacks mentioned above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the present invention, a method of recovering hydrocarbons from water-containing hydrocarbonaceous materials, such as tar sands, can include forming a constructed permeability control infrastructure. This constructed infrastructure defines a substantially encapsulated volume. A mined water-containing hydrocarbonaceous material can be introduced into the control infrastructure to form a permeable body of hydrocarbonaceous material. The permeable body can be heated sufficient to remove water therefrom in the form of water vapor. The water vapor can be removed from the encapsulated volume via a water vapor outlet such as a relief valve, perforated conduit, or the like. The water vapor outlet can further be closed at a time to prevent removal of substantial amounts of hydrocarbon vapors via the water vapor outlet. Specifically, when water vapor content falls to a predetermined level the vapor outlet can be either shut off or redirected to a separate hydrocarbon recovery system. Generally, this time corresponds to a time when a substantial portion of the water from the water-containing hydrocarbonaceous material has been removed. The remaining dewatered permeable body can be heated sufficiently to remove hydrocarbons therefrom. During heating the hydrocarbonaceous material can be substantially stationary. Removed hydrocarbons can be collected for further processing, use in the process as supplemental fuel or additives, and/or direct use without further treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention can allow difficult problems to be solved related to the extraction of hydrocarbon liquids and gases from surface or underground mined hydrocarbon bearing deposits and from harvested biomass such as tar sands, peat, lignite, coal, and biomass. Among other things, the present invention can help to reduce cost, increase volume output, lower air emissions, limit water consumption, prevent underground aquifer contamination, reclaim surface disturbances, reduce material handling costs, remove fine particulates, and improve composition of recovered hydrocarbon liquid or gas. The present invention also addresses water contamination issues with a safer, more predictable, engineered, observable, repairable, adaptable and preventative water protection structure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is an &#x201c;aboveground&#x201d; method which is mining-dependent, or dependent on separately collected material, e.g. biomass, yet it is not limited or encumbered to conventional aboveground (ex-situ) extraction and separation processes. This invention can substantially reduce or eliminate dependence on large quantities of water and provides better process control of temperature, pressure, injection rates, fluid and gas compositions, product quality and better permeability due to processing and heating mined tar sands or other functionally similar water-containing hydrocarbon materials. These advantages are available in accordance with the present invention while still addressing the volume, handling, and scalability issues.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other improvements which can be realized from the present invention are related to environmental protection. Conventional extraction and separation have had the problem of disposal of spent sands after mining and separation. This invention can address reclamation in a uniquely combined approach. In regards to air emissions which are also a major problem typical of prior surface retort methods, this invention, because of its enormous volume capacity and high permeability, can accommodate longer heating residence times and therefore lower temperatures. One benefit of lower temperatures in the extraction process is that carbon dioxide production from decomposition of carbonate ores can be substantially limited thereby dramatically reducing CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions and atmospheric pollutants. This invention uniquely provides solutions to problems for not just one, but many problems, and in an integrated approach. As a result, significant benefits to the public can be achieved in terms of energy production, economic opportunity, environmental stewardship and energy output.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In accordance with the present invention, a method of recovering hydrocarbons from water-containing hydrocarbonaceous materials can include forming a constructed permeability control infrastructure. This constructed infrastructure defines a substantially encapsulated volume. A mined or harvested water-containing hydrocarbonaceous material can be introduced into the control infrastructure to form a permeable body of hydrocarbonaceous material. The permeable body can be heated sufficient to remove water therefrom as a water vapor. The water vapor can be removed from the encapsulated volume via a water vapor outlet. The water vapor outlet can be controlled to prevent removal of substantial amounts of hydrocarbon vapor along with the water vapor. Generally, as the water vapor content begins to exhibit significant amounts of hydrocarbon vapor, the permeable body has been significantly dewatered. The dewatered permeable body can be heated sufficient to remove hydrocarbons therefrom. During heating, the hydrocarbonaceous material is substantially stationary as the constructed infrastructure is a fixed structure. Removed hydrocarbons can be collected for further processing, use in the process, and/or use as recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each of these aspects of the present invention is described in further detail below. The constructed permeability control infrastructure can be formed using existing grade as floor support and/or as side wall support for the constructed infrastructure. For example, the control infrastructure can be formed as a free standing structure, i.e. using only existing grade as a floor with side walls being man-made. Alternatively, the control infrastructure can be formed within an excavated pit. Regardless, the control infrastructures of the present invention are always formed above-grade.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A constructed permeability control infrastructure of the present invention can include a permeability control impoundment which defines a substantially encapsulated volume. The permeability control impoundment of the present invention is substantially free of undisturbed geological formations. Specifically, the permeability control aspect of the impoundment can be completely constructed and manmade as a separate isolation mechanism for prevention of uncontrolled migration of material into or out of the encapsulated volume.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment of the present invention, the permeability control impoundment can be formed along walls of an excavated hydrocarbonaceous material deposit. For example, tar sands or peat can be mined from a deposit to form a cavity which corresponds approximately to a desired encapsulation volume for an impoundment. The excavated cavity can then be used as a form and support to create the permeability control impoundment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one alternative aspect of the present invention, at least one additional excavated hydrocarbonaceous material deposit can be formed such that a plurality of impoundments can be operated. Further, such a configuration can facilitate a reduction in transportation distance of the mined material. Specifically, the mined hydrocarbonaceous material for any particular encapsulated volume can be mined from an adjacent excavated hydrocarbonaceous material deposit. In this manner, a grid of constructed structures can be built such that mined material can be immediately and directly filled into an adjacent impoundment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Mining and/or excavation of hydrocarbonaceous deposits can be accomplished using any suitable technique. Conventional surface mining can be used, although alternative excavators can also be used without requirement of transportation of the mined materials. In one specific embodiment, the hydrocarbonaceous deposit can be excavated using a crane-suspended excavator. One example of a suitable excavator can include vertical tunnel boring machines. Such machines can be configured to excavate rock and material beneath the excavator. As material is removed, the excavator is lowered to ensure substantially continuous contact with a formation. Removed material can be conveyed out of the excavation area using conveyors or lifts. Alternatively, the excavation can occur under aqueous slurry conditions to reduce dust problems and act as a lubricant/coolant. The slurry material can be pumped out of the excavation for separation of solids in a settling tank or other similar solid-liquid separator, or the solids may be allowed to precipitate directly in an impoundment. This approach can be readily integrated with simultaneous or sequential solution-based recovery of metals and other materials as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, excavation and formation of a permeability control impoundment can be accomplished simultaneously. For example, an excavator can be configured to remove hydrocarbonaceous material while side walls of an impoundment are formed. Material can be removed from just underneath edges of the side walls such that the walls can be guided downward to allow additional wall segments to be stacked above. This approach can allow for increased depths while avoiding or reducing dangers of cave-in prior to formation of supporting impoundment walls.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The impoundment can be formed of any suitable material which provides isolation of material transfer across walls of the impoundment. In this manner, integrity of the walls is retained during operation of the control infrastructure sufficient to substantially prevent uncontrolled migration of fluids outside of the control infrastructure. Non-limiting examples of suitable material for use in forming the impoundment of the constructed permeability control infrastructure can include clay, bentonite clay (e.g. clay comprising at least a portion of bentonite), compacted fill, refractory cement, cement, synthetic geogrids, fiberglass, rebar, nanocarbon fullerene additives, filled geotextile bags, polymeric resins, oil resistant PVC liners, or combinations thereof. Engineered cementitious composites (ECC) materials, fiber reinforced composites, and the like can be particularly strong and can be readily engineered to meet permeability and temperature tolerance requirements of a given installation. As a general guideline, materials having low permeability and high mechanical integrity at operating temperatures of the infrastructure are preferred although not required. For example, materials having a melting point above the maximum operating temperature of the infrastructure can be useful to maintain containment during and after heating and recovery. However, lower temperature materials can also be used if a non-heated buffer zone is maintained between the walls and heated portions of the permeable body. Such buffer zones can range from 6 inches to 50 feet depending on the particular material used for the impoundment and the composition of the permeable body. In another aspect of the present invention, walls of the impoundment can be acid, water and/or brine resistant, e.g. sufficient to withstand exposure to solvent recovery and/or rinsing with acidic or brine solutions, as well as to steam or water. For impoundment walls formed along formations or other solid support, the impoundment walls can be formed of a sprayed grouting, sprayed liquid emulsions, or other sprayed material such as sprayable refractory grade grouting which forms a seal against the formation and creates the permeability control wall of the impoundments of the present invention. Impoundment walls may be substantially continuous such that the impoundment defines the encapsulated volume sufficiently to prevent substantial movement of fluids into or out of the impoundment other than defined inlets and outlets, e.g. via conduits or the like as discussed herein. In this manner, the impoundments of the present invention can readily meet government fluid migration regulations. Alternatively, or in combination with a manufactured barrier, portions of the impoundment walls can be undisturbed geological formation and/or compacted earth. In such cases, the constructed permeability control infrastructure is a combination of permeable and impermeable walls as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one detailed aspect of the present invention, a portion of hydrocarbonaceous material, either pre- or post-processed, can be used as a cement fortification and/or cement base which are then poured in place to form portions or the entirety of walls of the control infrastructure. These materials can be formed in place or can be preformed and then assembled on site to form an integral impoundment structure. For example, the impoundment can be constructed by cast forming in place as a monolithic body, extrusion, stacking of preformed or precast pieces, concrete panels joined by a grout (cement, ECC or other suitable material), inflated form, or the like. The forms can be built up against a formation or can be stand alone structures. Forms can be constructed of any suitable material such as, but not limited to, steel, wood, fiberglass, polymer, or the like. The forms can be assembled in place or may be oriented using a crane or other suitable mechanism. Alternatively, the constructed permeability control infrastructure can be formed of gabions and/or geosynthetic fabrics assembled in layers with compacted fill material. Optional binders can be added to enhance compaction of the permeability control walls. In yet another detailed aspect of the present invention, the control infrastructure can comprise, or consists essentially of, sealant, grout, rebar, synthetic clay, bentonite clay, clay lining, refractory cement, high temperature geomembranes, drain pipes, alloy sheets, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, the construction of impoundment walls and floors can include multiple compacted layers of indigenous or manipulated low grade shale with any combination of sand, cement, fiber, plant fiber, nano carbons, crushed glass, reinforcement steel, engineered carbon reinforcement grid, clay, bentonite, calcium, carbonate, and the like. In addition to such composite walls, designs which inhibit long term fluid and gas migration through additional impermeability engineering can be employed including, but not limited to, liners, geo-membranes, compacted soils, imported sand, gravel or rock and gravity drainage contours to move fluids and gases away from impervious layers to egress exits. Impoundment floor and wall construction, can, but need not comprise, a stepped up or stepped down slope or bench as the case of mining course may dictate following the optimal ore grade mining. In any such stepped up or down applications, floor leveling and containment wall construction can typically drain or slope to one side or to a specific central gathering area(s) for removal of fluids by gravity drainage assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Optionally, capsule wall and floor construction can include insulation which prevents heat transfer outside of the constructed infrastructure or outside of inner capsules or conduits within the primary constructed capsule containment. Insulation can comprise manufactured materials, cement or various materials other materials which are less thermally conductive than surrounding masses, i.e. permeable body, formation, adjacent infrastructures, etc. Thermally insulating barriers can also be formed within the permeable body, along impoundment walls, ceilings and/or floors. One detailed aspect of the present invention includes the use of biodegradable insulating materials, e.g. soy insulation and the like. This is consistent with embodiments of the present invention wherein the impoundment is a single use system such that insulations, pipes, and/or other components can have a relatively low useful life, e.g. less than 1-2 years. This can reduce equipment costs as well as reduce long-term environmental impact.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The structures and methods of the present invention can be applied at almost any scale. Larger encapsulated volumes and increased numbers of impoundments can readily produce hydrocarbon products and performance comparable to or exceeding smaller constructed infrastructures. As an illustration, single impoundments can range in size from tens of meters across to tens of acres. Optimal impoundment sizes may vary depending on the hydrocarbonaceous material and operating parameters, however it is expected that suitable areas can range from about one-half to five acres in top plan surface area.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The methods and infrastructures of the present invention can be used for recovery of hydrocarbons from a variety of water-containing hydrocarbonaceous materials. One particular advantage of the present invention is a wide degree of latitude in controlling particle size, conditions, and composition of the permeable body introduced into the encapsulated volume. Non-limiting examples of mined hydrocarbonaceous material which can be treated comprise tar sands, coal, lignite, bitumen, peat, oil shale, or combinations thereof. Although tar sands and peat are most commonly water-containing materials, other hydrocarbonaceous materials can have water content sufficiently high to make conventional oil recovery processes difficult. In some cases it can be desirable to provide a single type of hydrocarbonaceous material so that the permeable body consists essentially of one of the above materials. However, the permeable body can include mixtures of these materials such that grade, oil content, hydrogen content, permeability and the like can be adjusted to achieve a desired result. Further, different hydrocarbon materials can be placed in multiple layers or in a mixed fashion such as combining coal, oil shale, tar sands, biomass, and/or peat.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, hydrocarbon containing material can be classified into various inner capsules within a primary constructed infrastructure for optimization reasons. For instance, layers and depths of mined oil shale formations may be richer in certain depth pay zones as they are mined. Once, blasted, mined, shoveled and hauled inside of capsule for placement, richer oil bearing ores can be classified or mixed by richness for optimal yields, faster recovery, or for optimal averaging within each impoundment. Further, providing layers of differing composition can have added benefits. For example, a lower layer of tar sands can be oriented below an upper layer of oil shale. Generally, the upper and lower layers can be in direct contact with one another although this is not required. The upper layer can include heating pipes embedded therein as described in more detail below. The heating pipes can heat the oil shale sufficient to liberate kerogen oil, including short-chain liquid hydrocarbons, which can act as a solvent for bitumen removal from the tar sands. In this manner, the upper layer acts as an in situ solvent source for enhancing bitumen removal from the lower layer. Heating pipes within the lower layer are optional such that the lower layer can be free of heating pipes or may include heating pipes, depending on the amount of heat transferred via downward passing liquids from the upper layer and any other heat sources. The ability to selectively control the characteristics and composition of the permeable body adds a significant amount of freedom in optimizing oil yields and quality.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, in many embodiments of the present invention, the liberated gaseous and liquid products act as an in situ produced solvent which supplements kerogen removal and/or additional hydrocarbon removal from the hydrocarbonaceous material.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In yet another detailed aspect of the present invention, the permeable body can further comprise an additive or biomass. Additives can include any composition which acts to increase the quality of removed hydrocarbons, e.g. increased API, decreased viscosity, improved flow properties, reduced wetting of residual sand or shale, reduction of sulfur, hydrogenation agents, etc. Non-limiting examples of suitable additives can include bitumen, kerogen, propane, natural gas, natural gas condensate, crude oil, refining bottoms, asphaltenes, natural gas, butane, methane, common solvents, other diluents, and combinations of these materials. In one specific embodiment, the additive can include a flow improvement agent and/or a hydrogen donor agent. Some materials can act as both or either agents to improve flow or as a hydrogen donor. Non-limiting examples of such additives can include methane, natural gas condensates, common solvent such as acetone, toluene, benzene, etc., and other additives listed above. Additives can act to increase the hydrogen to carbon ratio in any hydrocarbon products, as well as act as a flow enhancement agent. For example, various solvents and other additives can create a physical mixture which has a reduced viscosity and/or reduced affinity for particulate solids, rock and the like. Further, some additives can chemically react with hydrocarbons and/or allow liquid flow of the hydrocarbon products. Any additives used can become part of a final recovered product or can be removed and reused or otherwise disposed of.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Similarly, biological hydroxylation of hydrocarbonaceous materials to form synthetic gas or other lighter weight products can be accomplished using known additives and approaches. Other enzymes or biocatalysts can also be used in a similar manner. Further, manmade materials can also be used as additives such as, but not limited to, tires, polymeric refuse, or other hydrocarbon-containing materials.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Although the methods of the present invention are broadly applicable, as a general guideline, the permeable body can include particles from about &#x215b; inch to about 6 feet, and in some cases less than 1 foot and in other cases less than about 6 inches. However, as a practical matter, sizes from about 1 inch to about 2 feet can provide good results. As a general matter, any functional void space can be used; however, about 15% to about 40% and in some cases about 30% usually provides a good balance of permeability and effective use of available volumes. Void volumes can be varied somewhat by varying other parameters such as heating conduit placement, additives, and the like. Mechanical separation of mined water-containing hydrocarbonaceous materials allows creation of fine mesh, high permeability particles which enhance thermal dispersion rates once placed in capsule within the impoundment. The added permeability allows for more reasonable, low temperatures which also help to avoid higher temperatures which result in greater CO<sub>2 </sub>production from carbonate decomposition and associated release of trace heavy metals, volatile organics, and other compounds which can create toxic effluent and/or undesirable materials which must be monitored and controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, computer assisted mining, mine planning, hauling, blasting, assay, loading, transport, placement, and dust control measures can be utilized to fill and optimize the speed of mined material movement into the constructed capsule containment structure. In one alternative aspect of the present invention, the impoundments of the present invention can be formed in excavated volumes of a hydrocarbonaceous formation, although other locations remote from the control infrastructure can also be useful. For example, some hydrocarbonaceous formations have relatively thin hydrocarbon-rich layers, e.g. less than about 300 feet. Therefore, vertical mining and drilling tend to not be cost effective. In such cases, horizontal mining can be useful to recover the water-containing hydrocarbonaceous materials for formation of the permeable body. Although horizontal mining continues to be a challenging endeavor, a number of technologies have been developed and continue to be developed which can be useful in connection with the present invention. In such cases, at least a portion of the impoundment can be formed across a horizontal layer, while other portions of the impoundment can be formed along and/or adjacent non-hydrocarbon bearing formation layers. Other mining approaches such as, but not limited to, room and pillar mining can provide an effective source of hydrocarbonaceous material with minimal waste and/or reclamation which can be transported to an impoundment and treated in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As mentioned herein, the present invention allows for a large degree of control regarding properties and characteristics of the permeable body which can be designed and optimized for a given installation. Impoundments, individually and across a plurality of impoundments can be readily tailored and classified based on varying composition of materials, intended products and the like. For example, several impoundments can be dedicated to production of heavy crude oil, while others can be configured for production of lighter products and/or syn gas. Non-limiting example of potential classifications and factors can include catalyst activity, enzymatic reaction for specific products, aromatic compounds, hydrogen content, microorganism strain or purpose, upgrading process, target final product, pressure (effects product quality and type), temperature, swelling behavior, aquathermal reactions, hydrogen donor agents, heat superdisposition, garbage impoundment, sewage impoundment, reusable pipes, and others. Typically, a plurality of these factors can be used to configure impoundments in a given project area for distinct products and purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Once a desired permeable body has been formed within the control infrastructure, heat can be introduced sufficient to begin removal of water from the water-containing hydrocarbonaceous material to form a dewatered permeable body. As the permeable body is heated, water is typically among the first volatile components to be driven off as a water vapor. This water vapor will readily permeate through the permeable body and can be collected and removed via a suitable water vapor outlet. The water vapor outlet can be any outlet which can direct water vapor away from the encapsulated volume. For example, one or more steam relief valves can be placed along upper ceiling or upper walls of the encapsulated volume. Alternatively, or in addition to relief valves, perforated conduits can be embedded within the permeable body which can direct water vapor out of the encapsulated volume. During this portion of the heating process, small amounts of other non-water components may also be volatilized. Natural gas or other light hydrocarbons may be driven off with the water vapor. Such materials can be readily separated by physical separations. However, as a general guideline, withdrawal of the water vapor can be controlled in order to minimize removal of hydrocarbons. In particular, water vapor removal can generally correspond to initial dewatering stage of heating or pyrolysis of the bitumen or other hydrocarbons. Thus, the removal of water and initial stages of hydrocarbon heating and treatment can overlap in time. However, the water vapor outlet can be shut off at a time when the hydrocarbon content (especially C6 or greater) exceeds about 5% by volume of the total vapors removed via the water vapor outlet. The water vapor can often have sufficient heat value that heat recycling to other portions of the process can be beneficial, e.g. recycling heat to the permeable body, preheating of heating gases, driving a steam turbine, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The comminuted hydrocarbonaceous material can be filled into the control infrastructure to form the permeable body in any suitable manner. Typically the comminuted hydrocarbonaceous material can be conveyed into the control infrastructure by dumping, conveyors or other suitable approaches. As mentioned previously, the permeable body can have a suitably high void volume. Indiscriminate dumping can result in excessive compaction and reduction of void volumes. Thus, the permeable body can be formed by low compaction conveying of the hydrocarbonaceous material into the infrastructure. For example, retracting conveyors can be used to deliver the material near a top surface of the permeable body as it is formed. In this way, the hydrocarbonaceous material can retain a significant void volume between particles without substantial further crushing or compaction despite some small degree of compaction which often results from lithostatic pressure as the permeable body is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Once a desired permeable body has been formed within the control infrastructure, heat can be introduced sufficient to begin removal of hydrocarbons, e.g. via pyrolysis. A suitable heat source can be thermally associated with the permeable body. Optimal operating temperatures within the permeable body can vary depending on the composition and desired products. However, as a general guideline, operating temperatures can range from about 200&#xb0; F. to about 750&#xb0; F. Temperature variations throughout the encapsulated volume can vary and may reach as high as 900&#xb0; F. or more in some areas. In one embodiment, the operating temperature can be a relatively lower temperature to facilitate production of liquid product such as from about 200&#xb0; F. to about 650&#xb0; F. This heating step can be a roasting operation which results in beneficiation of the crushed ore of the permeable body. Further, one embodiment of the present invention comprises controlling the temperature, pressure and other variables sufficient to produce predominantly, and in some cases substantially only, liquid product. Generally, products can include both liquid and gaseous products, while liquid products can require fewer processing steps such as scrubbers etc. The relatively high permeability of the permeable body allows for production of liquid hydrocarbon products and minimization of gaseous products, depending to some extent on the particular starting materials and operating conditions. In one embodiment, the recovery of hydrocarbon products can occur substantially in the absence of cracking within the permeable body.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one aspect of the present invention, heat can be transferred to the permeable body via convection. Heated gases can be injected into the control infrastructure such that the permeable body is primarily heated via convection as the heated gases pass throughout the permeable body. Heated gases can be produced by combustion of natural gas, hydrocarbon product, or any other suitable source. The heated gases can be imported from external sources or recovered from the process of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Alternatively, or in combination with convective heating, a highly configurable approach can include embedding a plurality of conduits within the permeable body. The conduits can be configured for use as heating pipes, cooling pipes, heat transfer pipes, drainage pipes, or gas pipes. Further, the conduits can be dedicated to a single function or may serve multiple functions during operation of the infrastructure, i.e. heat transfer and drainage. The conduits can be formed of any suitable material, depending on the intended function. Non-limiting examples of suitable materials can include clay pipes, refractory cement pipes, refractory ECC pipes, poured in place pipes, metal pipes such as cast iron, stainless steel etc., polymer such as PVC, and the like. In one specific embodiment, all or at least a portion of the embedded conduits can comprise a degradable material. For example, non-galvanized 6&#x2033; cast iron pipes can be effectively used for single use embodiments and perform well over the useful life of the impoundment, typically less than about 2 years. Further, different portions of the plurality of conduits can be formed of different materials. Poured in place pipes can be especially useful for very large encapsulation volumes where pipe diameters exceed several feet. Such pipes can be formed using flexible wraps which retain a viscous fluid in an annular shape. For example, PVC pipes can be used as a portion of a form along with flexible wraps, where concrete or other viscous fluid is pumped into an annular space between the PVC and flexible wrap. Depending on the intended function, perforations or other apertures can be made in the conduits to allow fluids to flow between the conduits and the permeable body. Typical operating temperatures exceed the melting point of conventional polymer and resin pipes. In some embodiments, the conduits can be placed and oriented such that the conduits intentionally melt or otherwise degrade during operation of the infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The plurality of conduits can be readily oriented in any configuration, whether substantially horizontal, vertical, slanted, branched, or the like. At least a portion of the conduits can be oriented along predetermined pathways prior to embedding the conduits within the permeable body. The predetermined pathways can be designed to improve heat transfer, gas-liquid-solid contacting, maximize fluid delivery or removal from specific regions within the encapsulated volume, or the like. Further, at least a portion the conduits can be dedicated to heating of the permeable body. These heating conduits can be selectively perforated to allow heated gases or other fluids to convectively heat and mix throughout the permeable body. The perforations can be located and sized to optimize even and/or controlled heating throughout the permeable body. Alternatively, the heating conduits can form a closed loop such that heating gases or fluids are segregated from the permeable body. Thus, a &#x201c;closed loop&#x201d; does not necessarily require recirculation, rather isolation of heating fluid from the permeable body. In this manner, heating can be accomplished primarily or substantially only through thermal conduction across the conduit walls from the heating fluids into the permeable body. Heating in a closed loop allows for prevention of mass transfer between the heating fluid and permeable body and can reduce formation and/or extraction of gaseous hydrocarbon products.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">During the heating or roasting of the permeable body, localized areas of heat which exceed parent rock decomposition temperatures, often above about 900&#xb0; F., can reduce yields and form carbon dioxide and undesirable contaminating compounds which can lead to leachates containing heavy metals, soluble organics and the like. The heating conduits of the present invention can allow for substantial elimination of such localized hot spots while maintaining a vast majority of the permeable body within a desired temperature range. The degree of uniformity in temperature can be a balance of cost (e.g. for additional heating conduits) versus yields. However, at least about 85% of the permeable body can readily be maintained within about 5-10% of a target temperature range with substantially no hot spots, i.e. exceeding the decomposition temperature of the hydrocarbonaceous materials such as about 800&#xb0; F. and in many cases about 900&#xb0; F. Thus, operated as described herein, the systems of the present invention can allow for recovery of hydrocarbons while eliminating or substantially avoiding production of undesirable leachates. Although products can vary considerably depending on the starting materials, high quality liquid and gaseous products are possible. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a crushed oil shale material can produce a liquid product having an API from about 30 to about 45, with about 33 to about 38 being currently typical, directly from the oil shale without additional treatment. Interestingly, practice of the present invention has led to an understanding that pressure appears to be a much less influential factor on the quality of recovered hydrocarbons than temperature and heating times. Although heating times can vary considerably, depending on void space, permeable body composition, quality, etc., as a general guideline times can range from a few days (i.e. 3-4 days) up to about one year. In one specific example, heating times can range from about 2 weeks to about 4 months. Under-heating oil shale at short residence times, i.e. minutes to several hours, can lead to formation of leachable and/or somewhat volatile hydrocarbons. Accordingly, the present invention allows for extended residence times at moderate temperatures such that organics present in oil shale can be volatilized and/or carbonized, leaving insubstantial leachable organics. In addition, the underlying shale is not generally decomposed or altered which reduces soluble salt formation.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, conduits can be oriented among a plurality of impoundments and/or control infrastructures to transfer fluids and/or heat between the structures. The conduits can be welded to one another using conventional welding or the like. Further, the conduits can include junctions which allow for rotation and or small amounts of movement during expansion and subsidence of material in the permeable body. Additionally, the conduits can include a support system which acts to support the assembly of conduits prior to and during filling of the encapsulated volume, as well as during operation. For example, during heating flows of fluids, heating and the like can cause expansion (fracturing or popcorn effect) or subsidence sufficient to create potentially damaging stress and strain on the conduits and associated junctions. A truss support system or other similar anchoring members can be useful in reducing damage to the conduits. The anchoring members can include cement blocks, I-beams, rebar, columns, etc. which can be associated with walls of the impoundment, including side walls, floors and ceilings.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Alternatively, the conduits can be completely constructed and assembled prior to introduction of any mined materials into the encapsulated volume. Care and planning can be considered in designing the predetermined pathways of the conduits and method of filling the volume in order to prevent damage to the conduits during the filling process as the conduits are buried. Thus, as a general rule, the conduits used in the present invention are oriented ab initio, or prior to embedding in the permeable body such that they are non-drilled. As a result, construction of the conduits and placement thereof can be performed without extensive core drilling and/or complicated machinery associated with well-bore or horizontal drilling. Rather, horizontal or any other orientation of conduit can be readily achieved by assembling the desired predetermined pathways prior to, or contemporaneous with, filling the infrastructure with the mined hydrocarbonaceous material. The non-drilled, hand/crane-placed conduits oriented in various geometric patterns can be laid with valve controlled connecting points which yield precise and closely monitored heating within the capsule impoundment. The ability to place and layer conduits including connecting, bypass and flow valves, and direct injection and exit points, allow for precision temperature and heating rates, precision pressure and pressurization rates, and precision fluid and gas ingress, egress and composition admixtures. For example, when a bacteria, enzyme, or other biological material is used, optimal temperatures can be readily maintained throughout the permeable body to increase performance, reaction, and reliability of such biomaterials.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The conduits will generally pass through walls of the constructed infrastructure at various points. Due to temperature differences and tolerances, it can be beneficial to include an insulating material at the interface between the wall and the conduits. The dimensions of this interface can be minimized while also allowing space for thermal expansion differences during startup, steady-state operation, fluctuating operating conditions, and shutdown of the infrastructure. The interface can also involve insulating materials and sealant devices which prevent uncontrolled egress of hydrocarbons or other materials from the control infrastructure. Non-limiting examples of suitable materials can include high temperature gaskets, metal alloys, ceramics, clay or mineral liners, composites or other materials which having melting points above typical operating temperatures and act as a continuation of the permeability control provided by walls of the control infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, walls of the constructed infrastructure can be configured to minimize heat loss. In one aspect, the walls can be constructed having a substantially uniform thickness which is optimized to provide sufficient mechanical strength while also minimizing the volume of wall material through which the conduits pass. Specifically, excessively thick walls can reduce the amount of heat which is transferred into the permeable body by absorbing the same through conduction. Conversely, the walls can also act as a thermal barrier to somewhat insulate the permeable body and retain heat therein during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment, fluid and gas compounds within the permeable body can be altered for desired extractive products using, as an example, induced pressure through gases or piled lithostatic pressure from piled rubble. Thus, some degree of upgrading and/or modification can be accomplished simultaneous with the recovery process of the present invention. Further, certain water-containing hydrocarbonaceous materials can require treatment using specific diluents or other materials. For example, treatment of tar sands and dewatering thereof can be enhanced by supplemental steam injection or solvent injection to facilitate separation of bitumen from sand particles. Particularly in the case of tar sands, disposal and storage of spent solids, e.g. sands, is a simple matter. Specifically, once the hydrocarbon content of the peremeable body is sufficiently depleted, heating can be stopped. Any commercially valuable equipment can be removed, although the bulk of the constructed infrastructure and spent material can be left as is with substantially no additional treatment. Walls of the impoundment create a substantially permanent barrier to prevent environmental contamination of underground water reservoirs, nearby water flues, or the like. The top outer surfaces of the impoundment can be readily revegetated or remediated. Therefore, the methods and systems of the present invention can substantially eliminate environmental concerns related to disposal and storage of spent solids.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With the above description in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a side view of one embodiment of the invention showing an engineered capsule containment and extraction impoundment <b>100</b> where existing grade <b>108</b> is used primarily as support for the impermeable floor layer <b>112</b>. Exterior capsule impoundment side walls <b>102</b> provide containment and can, but need not be, subdivided by interior walls <b>104</b>. Subdividing can create separate containment capsules <b>122</b> within a greater capsule containment of the impoundment <b>100</b> which can be any geometry, size or subdivision. Further subdivisions can be horizontally or vertically stacked. By creating separate containment capsules <b>122</b> or chambers, classification of lower grade materials, varied gases, varied liquids, varied process stages, varied enzymes or microbiology types, or other desired and staged processes can be readily accommodated. Sectioned capsules constructed as silos within larger constructed capsules can also be designed to provide staged and sequenced processing, temperatures, gas and fluid compositions and thermal transfers. Such sectioned capsules can provide additional environmental monitoring and can be built of lined and engineered tailings berms similar to the primary exterior walls. In one embodiment, sections within the impoundment <b>100</b> can be used to place materials in isolation, in the absence of external heat, or with the intent of limited or controlled combustion or solvent application. Lower content hydrocarbon bearing material can be useful as a combustion material or as fill or a berm wall building material. Material which does not meet a various cut-off grade thresholds can also be sequestered without alteration in an impoundment dedicated for such purpose. In such embodiments, such areas may be completely isolated or bypassed by heat, solvents, gases, liquids, or the like. Optional monitoring devices and/or equipment can be permanently or temporarily installed within the impoundment or outside perimeters of the impoundments in order to verify containment of the sequestered material.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Walls <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> as well as cap <b>116</b> and impermeable layer <b>112</b> can be engineered and reinforced by gabions <b>146</b> and or geogrid <b>148</b> layered in fill compaction. Alternatively, these walls <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>112</b> which comprise the permeability control impoundment and collectively define the encapsulated volume can be formed of any other suitable material as previously described. In this embodiment, the impoundment <b>100</b> includes side walls <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> which are self-supporting. In one embodiment, tailings berms, walls, and floors can be compacted and engineered for structure as well as permeability. The use of compacted geogrids and other deadman structures for support of berms and embankments can be included prior to or incorporated with permeability control layers which may include sand, clay, bentonite clay, gravel, cement, grout, reinforced cement, refractory cements, insulations, geo-membranes, drainpipes, temperature resistant insulations of penetrating heated pipes, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one alternative embodiment, the permeability control impoundment can include side walls which are compacted earth and/or undisturbed geological formations while the cap and floors are impermeable. Specifically, in such embodiments an impermeable cap can be used to prevent uncontrolled escape of volatiles and gases from the impoundment such that appropriate gas collection outlets can be used. Similarly, an impermeable floor can be used to contain and direct collected liquids to a suitable outlet such the drain system <b>133</b> to remove liquid products from lower regions of the impoundment. Although impermeable side walls can be desirable in some embodiments, such are not always required. In some cases, side walls can be exposed undisturbed earth or compacted fill or earth, or other permeable material. Having permeable side walls may allow some small egress of gases and/or liquids from the impoundment.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Above, below, around and adjacent to constructed capsule containment vessels environmental hydrology measures can be engineered to redirect surface water away from the capsule walls, floors, caps, etc. during operation. Further, gravity assisted drainage pipes and mechanisms can be utilized to aggregate and channel fluids, liquids or solvents within the encapsulated volume to central gathering, pumping, condensing, heating, staging and discharge pipes, silos, tanks, and/or wells as needed. In a similar manner, steam and/or water which is intentionally introduced, e.g. for tar sands bitumen treatment, can be recycled.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Once wall structures <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> have been constructed above a constructed and impermeable floor layer <b>112</b> which commences from ground surface <b>106</b>, the mined rubble <b>120</b> (which may be crushed or classified according to size or hydrocarbon richness), can be placed in layers upon (or next to) placed tubular heating pipes <b>118</b>, fluid drainage pipes <b>124</b>, and, or gas gathering or injection pipes <b>126</b>. These pipes can be oriented and designed in any optimal flow pattern, angle, length, size, volume, intersection, grid, wall sizing, alloy construction, perforation design, injection rate, and extraction rate. In some cases, pipes such as those used for heat transfer can be connected to, recycled through or derive heat from heat source <b>134</b>. Alternatively, or in combination with, recovered gases can be condensed by a condenser <b>140</b>. Heat recovered by the condenser can be optionally used to supplement heating of the permeable body or for other process needs.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Heat source <b>134</b> can derive, amplify, gather, create, combine, separate, transmit or include heat derived from any suitable heat source including, but not limited to, fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells, solar sources, wind sources, hydrocarbon liquid, solid (e.g. coal, coke, lignite, etc.) or gas combustion heaters, geothermal heat sources, nuclear power plant, coal fired power plant, radio frequency generated heat, wave energy, flameless combustors, natural distributed combustors, or any combination thereof. In some cases, electrical resistive heaters or other heaters can be used, although solid oxide fuel cells and combustion-based heaters are currently preferred. In some locations, geothermal water can be circulated to the surface in adequate amounts to heat the permeable body and directed into the infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In another embodiment, electrically conductive material can be distributed throughout the permeable body and an electric current can be passed through the conductive material sufficient to generate heat. The electrically conductive material can include, but is not limited to, metal pieces or beads, conductive cement, metal coated particles, metal-ceramic composites, conductive semi-metal carbides, calcined petroleum coke, laid wire, combinations of these materials, and the like. The electrically conductive material can be premixed having various mesh sizes or the materials can be introduced into the permeable body subsequent to formation of the permeable body.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Liquids or gases can transfer heat from heat source <b>134</b>, or in another embodiment, in the cases of hydrocarbon liquid or gas combustion, radio frequency generators (microwaves), fuel cells, or solid oxide fuel cells all can, but need not, actually generate heat inside of capsule impoundment area <b>114</b> or <b>122</b>. In one embodiment, heating of the permeable body can be accomplished by convective heating from hydrocarbon combustion. Of particular interest is hydrocarbon combustion performed under stoichiometric conditions of fuel to oxygen. Stoichiometric conditions can allow for significantly increased heat gas temperatures. Stoichiometric combustion can employ but does not generally require a pure oxygen source which can be provided by known technologies including, but not limited to, oxygen concentrators, membranes, electrolysis, and the like. In some embodiments oxygen can be provided from air with stoichiometric amounts of oxygen and hydrogen. Combustion off gas can be directed to an ultra-high temperature heat exchanger, e.g. a ceramic or other suitable material having an operating temperature above about 2500&#xb0; F. Air obtained from ambient or recycled from other processes can be heated via the ultra high temperature heat exchanger and then sent to the impoundment for heating of the permeable body. The combustion off gases can then be sequestered without the need for further separation, i.e. because the off gas is predominantly carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In order to minimize heat losses, distances can be minimized between the combustion chamber, heat exchanger and impoundments. Therefore, in one specific detailed embodiment portable combustors can be attached to individual heating conduits or smaller sections of conduits. Portable combustors or burners can individually provide from about 100,000 Btu to about 1,000,000 Btu with about 600,000 Btu per pipe generally being sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Alternatively, in-capsule combustion can be initiated inside of isolated capsules within a primary constructed capsule containment structure. This process partially combusts hydrocarbonaceous material to provide heat and intrinsic pyrolysis. Unwanted air emissions <b>144</b> can be captured and sequestered in a formation <b>108</b> once derived from capsule containment <b>114</b>, <b>122</b> or from heat source <b>134</b> and delivered by a drilled well bore <b>142</b>. Heat source <b>134</b> can also create electricity and transmit, transform or power via electrical transmission lines <b>150</b>. The liquids or gases extracted from capsule impoundment treatment area <b>114</b> or <b>122</b> can be stored in a nearby holding tank <b>136</b> or within a capsule containment <b>114</b> or <b>122</b>. For example, the impermeable floor layer <b>112</b> can include a sloped area <b>110</b> which directs liquids towards drain system <b>133</b> where liquids are directed to the holding tank.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As rubble material <b>120</b> is placed with piping <b>118</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, and <b>128</b>, various measurement devices or sensors <b>130</b> are envisioned to monitor temperature, pressure, fluids, gases, compositions, heating rates, density, and all other process attributes during the extractive process within, around, or underneath the engineered capsule containment impoundment <b>100</b>. Such monitoring devices and sensors <b>130</b> can be distributed anywhere within, around, part of, connected to, or on top of placed piping <b>118</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, and <b>128</b> or, on top of, covered by, or buried within rubble material <b>120</b> or impermeable barrier zone <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As placed rubble material <b>120</b> fills the capsule treatment area <b>114</b> or <b>122</b>, <b>120</b> becomes the ceiling support for engineered impermeable cap barrier zone <b>138</b>, and wall barrier construction <b>170</b>, which may include any combination of impermeability and engineered fluid and gas barrier or constructed capsule construction comprising those which may make up <b>112</b> including, but not limited to clay <b>162</b>, compacted fill or import material <b>164</b>, cement or refractory cement containing material <b>166</b>, geo synthetic membrane, liner or insulation <b>168</b>. Above <b>138</b>, fill material <b>116</b> is placed to create lithostatic pressure upon the capsule treatment areas <b>114</b> or <b>122</b>. Covering the permeable body with compacted fill sufficient to create an increased lithostatic pressure within the permeable body can be useful in further increasing hydrocarbon product quality. A compacted fill ceiling can substantially cover the permeable body, while the permeable body in return can substantially support the compacted fill ceiling. The compacted fill ceiling can further be sufficiently impermeable to removed hydrocarbon or an additional layer of permeability control material can be added in a similar manner as side and/or floor walls. Additional pressure can be introduced into extraction capsule treatment area <b>114</b> or <b>122</b> by increasing any gas or fluid pressures via any of piping <b>118</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, or <b>128</b>, which gases or fluids can be extracted, treated, recycled or from other sources. All relative measurements, optimization rates, injection rates, extraction rates, temperatures, heating rates, flow rates, pressure rates, capacity indicators, chemical compositions, or other data relative to the process of heating, extraction, stabilization, sequestration, impoundment, upgrading, refining or structure analysis within the capsule impoundment <b>100</b> are envisioned through connection to a computing device <b>132</b> which operates computer software for the management, calculation and optimization of the entire process. Further, core drilling, geological reserve analysis and assay modeling of a formation prior to blasting, mining and hauling (or at anytime before, after or during such tasks) can serve as data input feeds into computer controlled mechanisms that operate software to identify optimal placements, dimensions, volumes and designs calibrated and cross referenced to desired production rate, pressure, temperature, heat input rates, gas weight percentages, gas injection compositions, heat capacity, permeability, porosity, chemical and mineral composition, compaction, density. Such analysis and determinations may include other factors like weather data factors such as temperature and air moisture content impacting the overall performance of the constructed infrastructure. Other data such as ore moisture content, hydrocarbon richness, weight, mesh size, and mineral and geological composition can be utilized as inputs including time value of money data sets yielding project cash flows, debt service and internal rates of return.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a collection of impoundments including an uncovered or uncapped capsule impoundment <b>100</b>, containing sectioned capsule impoundments <b>122</b> inside of a mining quarry <b>200</b> with various elevations of bench mining. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a single impoundment <b>122</b> without associated conduits and other aspects merely for clarity. This impoundment can be similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or any other configuration. In some embodiments, it is envisioned that mining rubble can be transferred down chutes <b>230</b> or via conveyors <b>232</b> to the quarry capsule impoundments <b>100</b> and <b>122</b> without any need of mining haul trucks.</p>

Indigenous plants which may have been temporarily moved from the area may be replanted such as trees <b>306</b>. The constructed infrastructures of the present invention can generally be single use structures which can be readily and securely shut down with minimal additional remediation. This can dramatically reduce costs associated with moving large volumes of spent materials. However, in some circumstances the constructed infrastructures can be excavated and reused. Some equipment such as radio frequency (RF) mechanisms, tubulars, devices and emitters may be recovered from within the constructed impoundment upon completion of hydrocarbon recovery.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows computer means <b>130</b> controlling various property inputs and outputs of conduits <b>118</b>, <b>126</b>, or <b>128</b> connected to heat source <b>134</b> during the process among the subdivided impoundments <b>122</b> within a collective impoundment <b>100</b> to control heating of the permeable body. Heat can be optionally a closed loop such that gases are returned to the heat source via return conduits <b>135</b> or otherwise directed away from the impoundments. Similarly, liquid and vapor collected from the impoundments can be monitored and collected in tank <b>136</b> and condenser <b>140</b>, respectively. For example, liquid products can be collected via a drainage system (not shown) and stored in liquid collection tank <b>136</b>. Vapor products from individual impoundments can be collected via a suitable gas collection system and directed to the condenser. Condensable products are typically high quality hydrocarbons, e.g. kerosene, jet fuels, or other high grade fuels, and can be stored separately in condensables tank <b>141</b>. Similarly, non-condensable portions can be directed to other parts of the process or stored in tank <b>143</b>. As described previously, the liquid and vapor products can be combined or more often left as separate products depending on condensability, target product, and the like. A portion of the vapor product can be condensed and combined with the liquid products in tank <b>136</b>. However, much of the vapor product will be C4 and lighter gases which can be burned, sold or used within the process. For example, hydrogen gas may be recovered using conventional gas separation and used to hydrotreat the liquid products according to conventional upgrading methods, e.g. catalytic, etc. or the non-condensable gaseous product can be burned to produce heat for use in heating the permeable body, heating an adjacent or nearby impoundment, heating service or personnel areas, or satisfying other process heat requirements. The constructed infrastructure can include thermocouples, pressure meters, flow meters, fluid dispersion sensors, richness sensors and any other conventional process control devices distributed throughout the constructed infrastructure. These devices can be each operatively associated with a computer such that heating rates, product flow rates, and pressures can be monitored or altered during heating of the permeable body. Optionally, in-place agitation can be performed using, for example, ultrasonic generators which are associated with the permeable body. Such agitation can facilitate separation and pyrolysis of hydrocarbons from the underlying solid materials with which they are associated. Further, sufficient agitation can reduce clogging and agglomeration throughout the permeable body and the conduits.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows how any of the conduits can be used to transfer heat in any form of gas, liquid or heat via transfer means <b>510</b> from any sectioned capsule impoundment to another. Then, cooled fluid can be conveyed via heat transfer means <b>512</b> to the heat originating capsule <b>500</b>, or heat originating source <b>134</b> to pick up more heat from capsule <b>500</b> to be again recirculated to a destination capsule <b>522</b>. Thus, various conduits can be used to transfer heat from one impoundment to another in order to recycle heat and manage energy usage to minimize energy losses.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In yet another aspect of the present invention, a hydrogen donor agent can be introduced into the permeable body during the step of heating. The hydrogen donor agent can be any composition which is capable of hydrogenation of the hydrocarbons and can optionally be a reducing agent. Non-limiting examples of suitable hydrogen donor agents can include synthesis gas, propane, methane, hydrogen, natural gas, natural gas condensate, industrial solvents such as acetones, toluenes, benzenes, xylenes, cumenes, cyclopentanes, cyclohexanes, lower alkenes (C4-C10), terpenes, substituted compounds of these solvents, etc., and the like. Further, the recovered hydrocarbons can be subjected to hydrotreating either within the permeable body or subsequent to collection. Advantageously, hydrogen recovered from the gas products can be reintroduced into the liquid product for upgrading. Regardless, hydrotreating or hydrodesulfurization can be very useful in reducing nitrogen and sulfur content in final hydrocarbon products. Optionally, catalysts can be introduced to facilitate such reactions. In addition, introduction of light hydrocarbons into the permeable body can result in reforming reactions which reduce the molecular weight, while increasing the hydrogen to carbon ratio. This is particularly advantageous for use in the present invention due at least in part to high permeability of the permeable body, e.g. often around 30% void volume although void volume can generally vary from about 15% to about 40% void volume. Light hydrocarbons which can be injected can be any which provide reforming to recovered hydrocarbons. Non-limiting examples of suitable light hydrocarbons include natural gas, natural gas condensates, industrial solvents, hydrogen donor agents, and other hydrocarbons having ten or fewer carbons, and often five or fewer carbons. Currently, natural gas is an effective, convenient and plentiful light hydrocarbon. As mentioned previously, various solvents or other additives can also be added to aid in extraction of hydrocarbon products from the oil shale and can often also increase fluidity.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The light hydrocarbon can be introduced into the permeable body by conveying the same through a delivery conduit having an open end in fluid communication with a lower portion of the permeable body such that the light hydrocarbons (which are a gas under normal operating conditions) permeate up through the permeable body. Alternatively, this same approach can be applied to recovered hydrocarbons which are first delivered to an empty impoundment. In this way, the impoundment can act as a holding tank for direct products from a nearby impoundment and as a reformer or upgrader. In this embodiment, the impoundment can be at least partially filled with a liquid product where the gaseous light hydrocarbon is passed through and allowed to contact the liquid hydrocarbon products at temperatures and conditions sufficient to achieve reforming in accordance with well known processes. Optional reforming catalysts which include metals such as Pd, Ni or other suitable catalytically active metals can also be included in the liquid product within the impoundment. The addition of catalysts can serve to lower and/or adjust reforming temperature and/or pressure for particular liquid products. Further, the impoundments of the present invention can be readily formed at almost any depth. Thus, optimal reforming pressures (or recovery pressures when using impoundment depth as pressure control measure for recovery from a permeable body) can be designed based on hydrostatic pressure due to the amount of liquid in the impoundment and the height of the impoundment, i.e. P=&#x3c1;gh. In addition, the pressure can vary considerably over the height of the impoundment sufficient to provide multiple reforming zones and tailorable pressures. Generally, pressures within the permeable body can be sufficient to achieve substantially only liquid extraction, although some minor volumes of vapor may be produced depending on the particular composition of the permeable body. As a general guideline, pressures can range from about 5 atm to about 50 atm, although pressures from about 6 atm to about 20 atm can be particularly useful. However, any pressure greater than about atmospheric can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one embodiment, extracted crude has fines precipitated out within the subdivided capsules. Extracted fluids and gases can be treated for the removal of fines and dust particles. Separation of fines from shale oil can be accomplished by techniques such as, but not limited to, counter flow filtration, hot gas filtering, precipitation, and heavy oil recycling.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Hydrocarbon products recovered from the permeable body can be further processed (e.g. refined) or used as produced. Any condensable gaseous products can be condensed by cooling and collection, while non-condensable gases can be collected, burned as fuel, reinjected, or otherwise utilized or disposed of. Optionally, mobile equipment can be used to collect gases. These units can be readily oriented proximate to the control infrastructure and the gaseous product directed thereto via suitable conduits from an upper region of the control infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In yet another alternative embodiment, heat within the permeable body can be recovered subsequent to primary recovery of hydrocarbon materials therefrom. For example, a large amount of heat is retained in the permeable body. In one optional embodiment, the permeable body can be flooded with a heat transfer fluid such as water to form a heated fluid, e.g. heated water and/or steam. At the same time, this process can facilitate removal of some residual hydrocarbon products via a physical rinsing of the spent shale solids. In some cases, the introduction of water and presence of steam can result in water gas shift reactions and formation of synthesis gas. Steam recovered from this process can be used to drive a generator, directed to another nearby infrastructure, or otherwise used. Hydrocarbons and/or synthesis gas can be separated from the steam or heated fluid by conventional methods.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Although the methods and infrastructure of the present invention allow for improved permeability and control of operating conditions, significant quantities of unrecovered hydrocarbons, precious metals, minerals, sodium bicarbonate or other commercially valuable materials often remain in the permeable body. Therefore, a selective solvent can be injected or introduced into the permeable body. Typically, this can be done subsequent to collecting the hydrocarbons, although certain selective solvents can be beneficially used prior to heating and/or collection. This can be done using one or more of the existing conduits or by direct injection and percolation through the permeable body. The selective solvent or leachate can be chosen as a solvent for one or more target materials, e.g. minerals, precious metal, heavy metals, hydrocarbons, or sodium bicarbonate. In one specific embodiment, steam or carbon dioxide can be used as a rinse of the permeable body to dislodge at least a portion of any remaining hydrocarbons. This can be beneficial not only in removing potentially valuable secondary products, but also in cleaning remaining spent materials of trace heavy metal or inorganics to below detectable levels in order to comply with regulatory standards or to prevent inadvertent leaching of materials at a future date.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">More particularly, various recovery steps can be used either before or after heating of the permeable body to recover heavy metals, precious metals, trace metals or other materials which either have economic value or may cause undesirable problems during heating of the permeable body. Typically, such recovery of materials can be performed prior to heat treatment of the permeable body. Recovery steps can include, but are in no way limited to, solution mining, leaching, solvent recovery, precipitation, acids (e.g. hydrochloric, acidic halides, etc.), flotation, ionic resin exchange, electroplating, or the like. For example, heavy metals, bauxite or aluminum, and mercury can be removed by flooding the permeable body with an appropriate solvent and recirculating the resulting leachate through appropriately designed ion exchange resins (e.g. beads, membranes, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Similarly, bioextraction, bioleaching, biorecovery, or bioremediation of hydrocarbon material, spent materials, or precious metals can be performed to further improve remediation, extract valuable metals, and restoration of spent material to environmentally acceptable standards. In such bioextraction scenarios, conduits can be used to inject catalyzing gases as a precursor which helps to encourage bioreaction and growth. Such microorganisms and enzymes can biochemically oxidize the ore body or material or cellulosic or other biomass material prior to an ore solvent extraction via bio-oxidation. For example, a perforated pipe or other mechanism can be used to inject a light hydrocarbon (e.g. methane, ethane, propane or butane) into the permeable body sufficient to stimulate growth and action of native bacteria. Bacteria can be native or introduced and may grow under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Such bacteria can release metals from the permeable body which can then be recovered via flushing with a suitable solvent or other suitable recovery methods. The recovered metals can then be precipitated out using conventional methods.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Synthesis gas can also be recovered from the permeable body during the step of heating. Various stages of gas production can be manipulated through processes which raise or lower operating temperatures within the encapsulated volume and adjust other inputs into the impoundment to produce synthetic gases which can include but are not limited to, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, hydrocarbons, ammonia, water, nitrogen or various combinations thereof. In one embodiment, temperature and pressure can be controlled within the permeable body to lower CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions as synthetic gases are extracted.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Hydrocarbon product recovered from the constructed infrastructures of the present invention can most often be further processed, e.g. by upgrading, refining, etc. Sulfur from related upgrading and refining processing can be isolated in various constructed sulfur capsules within the greater structured impoundment capsule. Constructed sulfur capsules can be spent constructed infrastructures or dedicated for the purpose of storage and isolation after desulfurization.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Similarly, spent hydrocarbonaceous material remaining in the constructed infrastructure can be utilized in the production of cement and aggregate products for use in construction or stabilization of the infrastructure itself or in the formation of offsite constructed infrastructures. Such cement products made with the spent shale may include, but are not limited to, mixtures with Portland cement, calcium, volcanic ash, perlite, synthetic nano carbons, sand, fiber glass, crushed glass, asphalt, tar, binding resins, cellulosic plant fibers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In still another embodiment of the present invention, injection, monitoring and production conduits or extraction egresses can be incorporated into any pattern or placement within the constructed infrastructure. Monitoring wells and constructed geo membrane layers beneath or outside of the constructed capsule containment can be employed to monitor unwanted fluid and moisture migration outside of containment boundaries and the constructed infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Although a filled and prepared constructed infrastructure can often be immediately heated to recover hydrocarbons, this is not required. For example, a constructed infrastructure which is built and filled with mined hydrocarbonaceous material can be left in place as a proven reserve. Such structures are less susceptible to explosion or damage due to terrorist activity and can also provide strategic reserves of unprocessed petroleum products, with classified and known properties so that economic valuations can be increased and more predictable. Long term petroleum storage often faces quality deterioration issues over time. Thus, the present invention can optionally be used for long term quality insurance and storage with reduced concerns regarding breakdown and degradation of hydrocarbon products.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In still another aspect of the present invention, the high quality liquid product can be blended with more viscous lower quality (e.g. lower API) hydrocarbon products. For example, kerogen oil produced from the impoundments can be blended with bitumen to form a blended oil. The bitumen is typically not transportable through an extended pipeline under conventional and accepted pipeline standards and can have a viscosity substantially above and an API substantially below that of the kerogen oil. The amount of blending can vary considerably depending on the particular quality of bitumen and kerogen oils. However, as a general guideline the blended oil can be from 5% to 95% kerogen oil, in some cases from about 10% to about 40%, and in other cases from about 50% to 80%, with substantially a remainder of the blended oil comprising bitumen. By blending the kerogen oil and bitumen, the blended oil can be rendered transportable without the use of additional diluents or other viscosity or API modifiers. As a result, the blended oil can be pumped through a pipeline without requiring additional treatments to remove a diluent or returning such diluents via a secondary pipeline. Conventionally, bitumen is combined with a diluent such as natural gas condensate or other low molecular weight liquids, to allow pumping to a remote location. The diluent is removed and returned via a second pipeline back to the bitumen source. The present invention allows for elimination of returning diluent and simultaneous upgrading of the bitumen.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">It is to be understood that the above-referenced arrangements are illustrative of the application for the principles of the present invention. Thus, while the present invention has been described above in connection with the exemplary embodiments of the invention, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications and alternative arrangements can be made without departing from the principles and concepts of the invention as set forth in the claims.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(a) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The manufacturing method for seamless manmade leather ball of the invention is mainly disclosed to allow an inflatable ball bladder having a peripherally wrapped around binding yarn or cloth thereon to form a reinforcement layer to be formed to a seamless ball with a simulated leather surface, wherein its manufacturing method is mainly that composites such as soft bioplastic resin or manmade leather, etc are injected, extruded or hot compressed to form hemisphere shaped upper half bowl type thin cover and lower half bowl type thin cover to completely matchingly sleeve and sphere the corresponding ball bladder. Subsequently, said ball bladder enclosed by bowl type thin covers being put into the one step or two steps hemisphere shaped bowl type upper and lower matching curing molds is pressingly combined under the pressure of the same spherical shape and size and the high temperature curing condition suitable for resin compound softening or for foaming or not foaming resin compound, thereby allowing resin compound softening to fusionly paste with reinforcement layer on the peripheral outside of said ball bladder to become an initial blank with waterproof layer. Said initial blank while still hot can be put in another set of semi-spherical shaped bowl type upper and lower matching forming molds to be pressingly combined and cooled down to a fixed form, and various convex lines pre-made on the inside surfaces of forming molds form ball face pre-forming lines such as block shapes or seam lines on the peripheral surface of the initial blank, thereby forming a seamless base body. Next, surface of said base body is further cortex layer treated or is further put in the forming molds for pressingly combination by pre-made lines thereby allowing said ball body to appear an excellent simulated leather ball outlook.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(b) Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Inflated ball structures meeting the requirements for strong impact bearing, smooth rolling and roundness are usually made to a leather ball with ball cortex layer made by manual sewing, machine sewing, or piecewise pasted, as well as a true leather or a manmade leather sheet, wherein most of them are used in formal spots competitions such as foot ball games. However, due to complexity of processing cortex layer and precision requirement for said kinds of balls, besides of the major imperfections such as the incapability to effectively promote production and high price, the other disadvantages such as outlook defects such as degumming, drops off due to leather pasting method as well as poor waterproofing defects due to manual and machine sewing methods have caused rising demands and applicability in manmade leather balls with cheaper manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the conventional manufacturing method for manmade leather ball, the planetary leather or cloth is cut to pieces for separately pasting on or manually sewing, machine sewing on the outside of ball bladder ready to be inflated to a ball shape for use as the outer skin of the ball so as to form a ball with leather feeling and outlook. Nonetheless, conventional methods are mainly relied on manual pasting and sewing which has numerous processing procedures and complicated and have the imperfections to produce bad or non-uniform products. Especially there is a high waste ratio in the method of cutting pieces, hence regarding basic consideration in material cost, it is difficult to achieve economic effectiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, the first part of preparation work in cutting planetary leather or cloth to piecewise shapes as well as the succeeding work of pasting, manual sewing, machine sewing or piecewise printing operations all appear imperfections in processing complexities and unstable qualities causing unevenness on the ball body.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Especially for the spherical connecting outlook of concave seam lines which is normally stressed in true leather balls, the piecewise binding method is difficult to make overall tight closure or neatness on seaming areas, thereby usually causing serious defects in the outlook effect, quality sense, applicability and especially strength of ball structure due to unavoidable human errors by operators.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a composition of a granular solid wax particle coated with a powder, and a process for making a fuel or a base oil from the transported solid wax particles.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Highly paraffinic wax is made by a number of different refining processes. It may be further upgraded into other desirable hydrocarbon products, such as fuels, lubricants, and chemicals. As wax upgrading equipment is expensive to manufacture, and there are wax upgrading plants which are under utilized at a number of currently existing refineries, it is often desired to produce wax at one location and ship the wax to a distant location for further upgrading. The problem is that the wax is difficult to handle, especially in large quantities.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Others have shipped wax by melting it and transporting it in a molten form, selecting a high boiling cut of the wax and making hard solid pellets, making solid wax pellets and suspending them in other hydrocarbon liquids, and forming an emulsion of the wax in water. A number of these earlier shipping methods are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/950,662, filed Sep. 28, 2004. In some situations, the shipping of granular solids can be preferred over the shipping of molten wax or slurries. One situation is when the receiving site already has facilities for handling granular solids.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Others have also shipped wax as solid particles; however these waxes had boiling points well above 800&#xb0; F. such that the waxes were hard and could resist crushing. When a high boiling cut is selected, there is a wasteful loss of the up-gradable lower boiling wax. Typically these solid wax particles have been shipped in boxes or bags on pallets, where the pallets have only been loaded to about 2000 lbs per pallet. The majority of the earlier solid wax particles had low needle penetration at 25&#xb0; C. Either their needle penetrations were less than 2 mm/10 at 25&#xb0; C., or they were restricted to shipping in small containers so they would not break or clump together under their weight.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is desired is a granular solid wax particle with a lower boiling cut, or having a high needle penetration by ASTM D1321, that can be shipped in bulk in the hold of a large transport vessel without clumping together or breaking. It is especially desired that vessels with large holds, such as crude oil tankers, be utilized for shipping the granular solid wax particles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">We provide a granular solid wax particle, comprising: a) a highly paraffinic wax having a T10 boiling point less than 427&#xb0; C. (800&#xb0; F.) and comprising at least 40 weight percent n-paraffins; and b) an inorganic powder coating on the wax particle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">We also provide a process for making a fuel or a base oil, comprising transporting the granular solid wax particles in a transport vessel to a distant location where the granular solid wax particles are processed into the fuel or the base oil.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Although the shipping of granular solid particles may be relatively expensive compared to shipping liquid hydrocarbons, many common products are shipped this way. Examples of products that are economically shipped as granular solid particles are grains, hydroprocessing catalysts, coal, and granulated detergents. As long as the solid particles do not break or clump together, they may be easily transported as granular solids using a wide variety of processes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Sasol, Shell, and other wax producers, currently market granular solid wax pellets, flakes, grains, or pastilles. They are generally sold and transported in small packages to prevent the weight of the product from breaking or causing the solid particles to clump together. In addition, up until this invention the marketed granular solid wax particles have had T10 boiling points greater than 800&#xb0; F. Some examples of highly paraffinic Fischer-Tropsch derived granular solid wax particles are shown below.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Granular solid wax particles, in the context of this disclosure, are free flowing solids. &#x201c;Free flowing&#x201d; means: is capable of being in a flowing or running consistency. Examples of other free flowing solids include grains, hydroprocessing catalysts, coal, and granulated detergents. The granular solid wax particles of this invention have a particle size greater than 0.1 mm in the longest direction. Preferably they are of a particle size between 0.3 and 50 mm in diameter in the longest direction, and more preferably of a particle size between 1 and 30 mm in diameter in the longest direction. The granular solid wax particles most useful in this invention have a shape that is selected from one of the following: pastille, tablet, ellipsoid, cylinder, spheroid, egg-shaped, and essentially spheroid. By essentially spheroid we mean that the particle has a generally rounded shape with an aspect ratio of less than about 1.3. As used herein, &#x201c;aspect ratio&#x201d; is a geometric term defined by the value of the maximum projection of a particle divided by the value of the width of the particle. The &#x201c;maximum projection&#x201d; is the maximum possible particle projection. This is sometimes called the maximum caliper dimension and is the largest dimension in the maximum cross-section of the particle. The &#x201c;width&#x201d; of a particle is the particle projection perpendicular to the maximum projection and is the largest dimension of the particle perpendicular to the maximum projection. If the aspect ratio is being determined on a collection of particles, the aspect ratio may be measured on a few representative particles and the results averaged. Representative particles should be sampled by ASTM D5680-95a (Reapproved 2001). The wax may be formed into solid particles by a number of processes, including: molding, prilling, rolling, pressing, tumble agglomeration, extrusion, hydroforming, and rotoforming. Sandvik Process Systems (Shanghai), for example, has developed large rotoforming equipment for producing free flowing pastilles of paraffin wax that would be useful in this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Highly paraffinic wax, in the context of this disclosure, is wax having a high content of normal paraffins (n-paraffins). A highly paraffinic wax useful in the practice of the process scheme of the invention will generally comprise at least 40 weight percent n-paraffins, preferably greater than 50 weight percent n-paraffins, and more preferably greater than 75 weight percent n-paraffins. The weight percent n-paraffins is typically determined by gas chromatography, such as described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/897,906, filed Jul. 22, 2004.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Examples of highly paraffinic waxes that may be used in the present invention include slack waxes, deoiled slack waxes, refined foots oils, waxy lubricant raffinates, n-paraffin waxes, NAO waxes, waxes produced in chemical plant processes, deoiled petroleum derived waxes, microcrystalline waxes, Fischer-Tropsch derived waxes, and mixtures thereof. The pour points of the highly paraffinic waxes used in the practice of this invention are generally greater than about 50&#xb0; C. and usually greater than about 60&#xb0; C. The term &#x201c;Fischer-Tropsch derived&#x201d; means that the product, fraction, or feed originates, from or is produced at some stage by a Fischer-Tropsch process. The feedstock for the Fischer-Tropsch process may come from a wide variety of hydrocarbonaceous resources, including natural gas, coal, shale oil, petroleum, municipal waste, derivatives of these, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The highly paraffinic wax which is useful in the composition of the granular solid wax particle of this invention has a low T10 boiling point. Prior to this invention, granular solid waxes with such a low T10 boiling point would be too soft, and they would clump together under pressure during bulk transport. In preferred embodiments, the granular solid wax particle of this invention also has a broad boiling point. A broad boiling point granular solid wax particle is desired, for example, because the broader the boiling point the more crush resistant the granular solid wax particle will be, and the broader range of finished products that may be produced from it, preferably including one or more grades of base oils. All boiling range distributions and boiling points in this disclosure are measured using the simulated distillation total boiling point (SIMDIST TBP) standard analytical method ASTM D6352 or its equivalent unless stated otherwise. As used herein, an equivalent analytical method to ASTM D6352 refers to any analytical method which gives substantially the same results as the standard method. The T10 boiling point is the temperature at which 10 weight percent of the wax boils. The T90 boiling point is the temperature at which 90 weight percent of the wax boils. A highly paraffinic wax suitable for use in the invention has a T10 boiling point less than 427&#xb0; C. (800&#xb0; F.). Preferably the highly paraffinic wax has a T10 boiling point less than 343&#xb0; C. (650&#xb0; F.). Additionally, the highly paraffinic wax suitable for use in the invention will preferably have a T90 boiling point greater than 538&#xb0; C. (1000&#xb0; F.). Preferably the final boiling point of the highly paraffinic wax will be greater than about 620&#xb0; C. (about 1150&#xb0; F.). Less than about 10 weight percent of the highly paraffinic wax will preferably boil below about 260&#xb0; C. (about 500&#xb0; F.). Due to the broad boiling range of the highly paraffinic wax the difference between the T10 boiling point and the T90 boiling point will preferably be greater than about 275&#xb0; C. (about 500&#xb0; F.).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment the highly paraffinic wax which is useful in the composition of the granular solid wax particle of this invention has a high needle penetration at 25&#xb0; C. Needle penetration is determined by ASTM D1321-04. The needle penetration is greater than 3 mm/10 at 25&#xb0; C., preferably greater than 5. Prior to this invention, waxes with a needle penetration this high were too soft to ship in large transport containers without clumping together.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The granular solid wax particles of this invention comprise the highly paraffinic waxes described above and an inorganic powder coating. Inorganic powder compounds useful in this invention must be solid at room temperature, non-hydroscopic and be able to be reduced to a fine micron or submicron sized powder via conventional particle production technology. Useful inorganic powder compounds include but are not limited to the oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, phosphates, silicates, and combinations thereof of Group 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and/or 14 elements of the Periodic Table (IUPAC 1997). More preferred inorganic compounds that are useful in this art should be readily available and at low cost. They include but are not limited to alumina, aluminum phosphate, magnesium oxide, calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, iron oxide, silica, silicates, and various clays and minerals, such as kaolin, attapulgite, spiolite, talc, feldspars, olivines, dolomite, apatites, etc. While cost and availability of the powder coating is important, the most preferred compounds useful in this art are those powdered substances that adsorb the wax without being encapsulated by the wax in a hot drop wax test.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">We have discovered a simple test, referred to herein as the &#x201c;hot drop wax test,&#x201d; in which a hot molten droplet of the wax (from an eye dropper) at 80&#xb0; C. is dropped onto a flattened pile of powder heated to the same temperature as the wax. With the most useful powders, the wax will immediately be adsorbed by the powder, the resulting powder coating will not appear to be wet, and upon cooling, the wax impregnated powder can be easily spread out and dispersed by for example rolling the wax impregnated powder between one's fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With a less preferred powder, the molten wax droplet may linger on the surface for a few seconds, and then slowly penetrate the powder to produce a region that looks noticeably wet. Upon cooling a wax impregnated less preferred powder, the adsorbed wax will form a &#x201c;button&#x201d; with the powder indicating that the wax has encapsulated the less preferred powder. Some most useful powders that adsorb the wax without being encapsulated by the wax in a hot drop wax test include but are not limited to gamma alumina, alpha alumina, titanium oxide, and mixtures thereof. Adsorption occurs when one substance is being held inside another by physical bonds, rather than becoming chemically integrated into another (which is absorption).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The particle size of the powder will always be substantially smaller than the size of the highly paraffinic wax particles they are applied to. Thus the particle size of the powder coating should be less than 100 microns in diameter and more preferably less than 10 microns in diameter. Particle size and surface contaminants will influence the hot wax drop test. Thus it is important the powder coating material be ground to a size that performs acceptably in the hot drop wax test.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The amount of powder as a percentage of the total wax particle will clearly depend upon the surface to volume ratio of the wax particle and the sticking coefficient of the powder coating to the wax particle. However due to cost and handling issues, it is desirable that the powder coating account for less than eight weight percent by weight of the total coated wax particle. More preferably, the powder will weigh between 0.1 and 5 weight percent, and even more preferably will weigh between 0.1 and 3 weight percent or 0.5 and 3 weight percent of the total coated wax particle to insure that there is an adequate amount of the powder on the surface of the wax particle to prevent the particles from sticking or clumping together during transport.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Powder coatings are dry coatings that can be applied to the outer surface of the solid wax particles without the need for a solvent or volatile carrier. Examples of equipment that may be used to apply the powder coating are spray guns, tumbling drum mixers, and vibratory conveyors.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The likelihood of breakage or clumping is more pronounced the higher the height of wax in the hold of the transport vessel. The granular solid wax particles of this invention will not clump together or break under heavy loads. Typically they will withstand loads of greater than 450 g/cm2, more preferably greater than 600 g/cm2, and even more preferably greater than 650 g/cm2. A load of 690 g/cm2 is equivalent to the force of approximately 12 meters of solid wax particles pressing down from above. The granular solid wax particles of this invention may be transported in a transport vessel to a distant location when they are loaded in the transport vessel to a height of greater than 7.5 meters, preferably to a height greater than 12 meters.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An embodiment of the granular solid wax particle of this invention has a layer of harder wax between the highly paraffinic wax having a T10 boiling point less than 427&#xb0; C. (800&#xb0; F.) and the powder coating. This harder wax has a T10 boiling point greater than 510&#xb0; C. (950&#xb0; F.), such that it gives even greater crush resistance to the particle. The layer of harder wax can be applied by dipping, misting, spraying, standard panning, or other coating methods.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The granular solid wax particles may be loaded into a transport vessel using a wide variety of bulk solids handling equipment, including belt conveyors, screw conveyors, pneumatic conveyors, tubing, scoop loaders, blowers, vacuum-pressure loading systems, and hopper loaders. Due to dust created in handling and transporting the wax particles, it may be necessary to install either on shore or on the vessel one or more methods of trapping fine air borne particles, such as air filters, cyclones, electrostatic precipitators or any other method known in the art. Because the granular solid wax particles of this invention are less likely to crush and stick together, they may be handled relatively easily by conventional equipment. They are preferably loaded to a height greater than 7.5 meters, for example greater than 12 meters; such that large quantities may be transported in bulk in the hold of a large transport vessel. A preferred transport vessel is a crude oil tanker.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In preferred embodiments, the loaded transport vessel carrying the granular solid wax particles is transported to a distant location where the granular solid wax particles are unloaded for further processing. Similar processes used to load the transport vessel may be used to unload the granular solid wax particles from the transport vessel. Again due to attrition of the powder coating it may be necessary to make provisions for trapping dust such as particle filters, cyclones, electrostatic precipitators, and the like. Alternatively, a slurry of the granular solid wax particles could be made on the vessel just before unloading, such that the wax could be pumped off the vessel as a liquid slurry. Slurry processes that would be suitable to use are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/950,653, 10/950,654, and 10/950,662, filed on Sep. 28, 2004, and incorporated herein. Liquids useful for the creation of the liquid/wax slurry include water, alcohol, light-distillates, mid-grade distillates, vacuum gas oil, and/or other refinery streams or combinations thereof. Low sulfur liquids are preferred in applications where sulfur contamination of the wax is an issue. Alternatively, in some refineries where the resulting product could be sent to a conventional hydrocracker or lubricant hydrocracker, a liquid hydrocarbon feed such as a vacuum gas oil could be pumped into the transport vessel's hold, to allow for removal of the wax from the transport vessel as a slurry.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, one might use a pneumatic system to offload the solid wax particles from a transport vessel. A cyclone would be used to recover the wax, and the wax would be placed into an oil phase for further processing. The conditions of the cyclone would be set such that at least a portion of the powder is separated from the solid wax particles. The powder could be captured from the air in a conventional air filtration system (bag house), possibly with electrostatic precipitators. Optionally, at least a portion of the recovered powder can be returned to the granular solid wax particle production site.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the context of this invention a distant location is a site at least 10 miles away, preferably it is a site at least 100 miles away. The distant location may be a refinery, or more specifically a base oil production plant. Further processing may include melting, removal of the powder coating from the granular solid wax particles, vacuum distilling, hydroprocessing, solvent dewaxing, clay treating, and blending.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Removal of the powder coating, which may interfere with subsequent processing of the wax, may be achieved by one or more of the following: attrition, air blowing, water washing, acid washing or more preferably by melting the wax. With melting of the wax, the more dense powder coating will in most cases simply settle to the bottom of a tank or vessel where it can be collected and sold or simply reprocessed and returned to the granular solid wax particle production site. For very fine powder coatings it may be necessary to add a clarifying agent or additive, or use a hydrocyclone to separate the inorganic component from the molten wax. Alternatively, the molten wax could be purified by filtration or distillation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An especially preferred further processing option, and one for which the low boiling highly paraffinic wax has superior properties for, is hydroprocessing of the granular solid wax particles to produce one or more base oils. Hydroprocessing options include hydrotreating, hydrocracking, hydroisomerization, and hydrofinishing. Lighter products, such as diesel and naphtha, may also be produced as side products by the hydroprocessing of the low boiling highly paraffinic wax. Examples of hydroprocessing steps that would be suitable for use with the low boiling highly paraffinic wax are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/744,870, filed Dec. 23, 2003, and completely incorporated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment it is possible that the powder may be removed after the hydroprocessing of the wax if the hydroprocessing is done under upflow hydroprocessing conditions. Preferred processes for upflow hydroprocessing of wax are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,359,018, and incorporated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Examples of processes that may be used to remove the powder from the hydroprocessing product liquids are filtration, distillation, centrifugation, and combinations thereof. In some situations, removing the powder from the hydroprocessing product liquids may be easier than removing them from the granular solid wax particles prior to hydroprocessing.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The wax described in Example 1 was formed into substantially spherical particles of about 10 mm diameter by molding molten wax in a brass die. 15 grams of the wax particles were placed in a single layer in a 2&#x2033; diameter brass/bronze pellet press. A load of 690 g/cm2 was applied to the wax particles by slowly and evenly placing a large weight on the plunger of the pellet press. A load of 690 g/cm2 is equivalent to the force of approximately 12 meters (40 ft) of solid wax particles pressing down from above, assuming a wax density of 0.936 g/cm3 with a 40% void fraction. The particles were stored under the load at a temperature of 20&#xb0; C. After one week, the load was removed, and the plunger on the pellet press was carefully and slowly moved to push out the wax particles. It was observed that the uncoated wax particles stuck together into a single solid mass. When the compressed wax clump was placed in a Petri dish and then tilted the wax still clung together as one big lump. This demonstrated that the uncoated wax could not be shipped in the hold of a large transport vessel, since at the end of the journey it would be very difficult and/or expensive to remove the wax from the hold.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The 10 mm diameter wax particles described in Example 2 were coated by shaking the particles in a plastic bag with one of the following powders: 1.8 wt % titanium dioxide (JT Baker), 0.7 wt % gamma alumina (0.05 micron from Buehler), 2.8 wt % calcium carbonate (JT Baker), 1.0 wt % white wheat flour (Gold Medal), 1.0 wt % powdered sugar (C&#x26;H), or 0.1 wt % activated carbon (Darco KB-B, Aldrich). Thus 15 grams of coated particles of each type were individually placed into the 2&#x2033; diameter bronze/brass pellet press and a load of 690 g/cm2 was applied to the coated wax particles for 1 week at a temperature of 20&#xb0; C. The applied load was removed and the wax particles were then carefully ejected from the pellet press. The coated wax particles were then placed in a Petri dish, which was then tipped approximately 30 degrees to observe how the particles flowed.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The titanium dioxide and gamma alumina powder coatings completely prevented the wax particles from clumping together under the applied load. The coating of calcium carbonate was less effective but possibly could work if the load was smaller. The activated carbon coating was the least effective of the coatings. However, it is clear that even a poor powder coating is better than no coating at all.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 4</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To distinguish between highly effective powder coating materials from those that are less effective, we have discovered that by observing how a drop of hot molten wax interacts with the test powder heated to the same temperature, it is possible to predict the performance of the powder coating in the pressure test used in examples 2 and 3. Thus one drop of the Fischer-Tropsch wax from example 1 (FT wax), heated to 80&#xb0; C., was placed on approximately 3 grams of the test powder flattened with a spatula and also heated to 80&#xb0; C. The wax and test powder where then cooled to 20&#xb0; C. Observations were taken at 80&#xb0; C. and after cooling to 20&#xb0; C. The observations are summarized in Table III below:</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">These results demonstrate that certain powder coatings such as titanium dioxide interact very differently with the Fischer-Tropsch wax so that it does not become encapsulated by the wax, and thus does not form a solid &#x201c;button.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Clearly when two wax particles that are composed of highly paraffinic wax with a T10 boiling point less than 800&#xb0; F. are subject to pressures equivalent to 12 meters of wax the contact point surface will deform. The powder coatings help block the interdiffusion of wax from one particle to the next. Thus the particles can be easily separated. Powders that can be encapsulated by the wax are not as effective as those that seem to be readily adsorbed by the wax. Wax impregnated titanium dioxide powder flows and breaks apart almost the same as the pure starting material. This is not the case for the other powders that we tested, such as calcium carbonate and activated carbon, which at room temperature had formed a &#x201c;button.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">These results demonstrate that solid wax particles comprising a highly paraffinic wax with a T10 boiling point less than 800&#xb0; F. coated with a powder, such as titanium dioxide powder, would be ideal for shipping over long distances in the hold of a large transport vessel, such as a crude oil tanker.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention relates to the therapeutic use of oligonucleotides as immunostimulatory agents in immunotherapy applications. More particularly, the invention provides immunomers and an immunostimulatory oligonucleotides for use in methods for generating an immune response or for treating a patient in need of immunostimulation. The immunomers and an immunostimulatory oligonucleotides of the invention preferably comprise novel purines. The immunomers according to the invention further comprise at least two oligonucleotides linked at their 3&#x2032; ends, internucleoside linkages or functionalized nucleobase or sugar to a non-nucleotidic linker, at least one of the oligonucleotides being an immunomodulatory oligonucleotide and having an accessible 5&#x2032; end.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to immunology and immunotherapy applications using oligonucleotides as immunostimulatory agents.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Summary of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Oligonucleotides have become indispensable tools in modern molecular biology, being used in a wide variety of techniques, ranging from diagnostic probing methods to PCR to antisense inhibition of gene expression and immunotherapy applications. This widespread use of oligonucleotides has led to an increasing demand for rapid, inexpensive and efficient methods for synthesizing oligonucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The synthesis of oligonucleotides for antisense and diagnostic applications can now be routinely accomplished. See, e.g., <i>Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. </i>20: <i>Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs </i>pp. 165-189 (S. Agrawal, ed., Humana Press, 1993); <i>Oligonucleotides and Analogues, A Practical Approach</i>, pp. 87-108 (F. Eckstein, ed., 1991); and Uhlmann and Peyman, supra; Agrawal and Iyer, <i>Curr. Op. in Biotech. </i>6:12 (1995); and <i>Antisense Research and Applications </i>(Crooke and Lebleu, eds., CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993). Early synthetic approaches included phosphodiester and phosphotriester chemistries. For example, Khorana et al., <i>J. Molec. Biol. </i>72:209 (1972) discloses phosphodiester chemistry for oligonucleotide synthesis. Reese, <i>Tetrahedron Lett. </i>34:3143-3179 (1978), discloses phosphotriester chemistry for synthesis of oligonucleotides and polynucleotides. These early approaches have largely given way to the more efficient phosphoramidite and H-phosphonate approaches to synthesis. For example, Beaucage and Caruthers, <i>Tetrahedron Lett. </i>22:1859-1862 (1981), discloses the use of deoxyribonucleoside phosphoramidites in polynucleotide synthesis. Agrawal and Zamecnik, U.S. Pat. No. 5,149,798 (1992), discloses optimized synthesis of oligonucleotides by the H-phosphonate approach. Both of these modern approaches have been used to synthesize oligonucleotides having a variety of modified internucleotide linkages. Agrawal and Goodchild, <i>Tetrahedron Lett. </i>28:3539-3542 (1987), teaches synthesis of oligonucleotide methylphosphonates using phosphoramidite chemistry. Connolly et al., <i>Biochem. </i>23:3443 (1984), discloses synthesis of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates using phosphoramidite chemistry. Jager et al., <i>Biochem. </i>27:7237 (1988), discloses synthesis of oligonucleotide phosphoramidates using phosphoramidite chemistry. Agrawal et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci</i>. (<i>USA</i>) 85:7079-7083 (1988), discloses synthesis of oligonucleotide phosphoramidates and phosphorothioates using H-phosphonate chemistry.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">More recently, several researchers have demonstrated the validity of the use of oligonucleotides as immunostimulatory agents in immunotherapy applications. The observation that phosphodiester and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides can induce immune stimulation has created interest in developing this side effect as a therapeutic tool. These efforts have focused on phosphorothioate oligonucleotides containing the dinucleotide natural CpG. Kuramoto et al., <i>Jpn. J. Cancer Res. </i>83:1128-1131 (1992) teaches that phosphodiester oligonucleotides containing a palindrome that includes a CpG dinucleotide can induce interferon-alpha and gamma synthesis and enhance natural killer activity. Krieg et al., <i>Nature </i>371:546-549 (1995) discloses that phosphorothioate CpG-containing oligonucleotides are immunostimulatory. Liang et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>98:1119-1129 (1996) discloses that such oligonucleotides activate human B cells. Moldoveanu et al., <i>Vaccine </i>16:1216-124 (1998) teaches that CpG-containing phosphorothioate oligonucleotides enhance immune response against influenza virus. McCluskie and Davis, <i>J. Immunol. </i>161:4463-4466 (1998) teaches that CpG-containing oligonucleotides act as potent adjuvants, enhancing immune response against hepatitis B surface antigen. Hartman et al., J. Immunol 164: 1617-1624 (2000) teaches that the immunostimulatory sequence is species specific, and different between mice and primates.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other modifications of CpG-containing phosphorothioate oligonucleotides can also affect their ability to act as modulators of immune response. See, e.g., Zhao et al., <i>Biochem. Pharmacol</i>. (1996) 51:173-182; Zhao et al., <i>Biochem Pharmacol</i>. (1996) 52:1537-1544; Zhao et al., <i>Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev</i>. (1997) 7:495-502; Zhao et al., <i>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett</i>. (1999) 9:3453-3458; Zhao et al., <i>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett</i>. (2000) 10:1051-1054; Yu et al., <i>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett</i>. (2000) 10:2585-2588; Yu et al., <i>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett</i>. (2001) 11:2263-2267; and Kandimalla et al., <i>Bioorg Med. Chem</i>. (2001) 9:807-813.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">These reports make clear that there remains a need to be able to modulate the immune response caused by immunostimulatory oligonucleotides and to overcome species specificity of the immunostimulatory sequences.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention provides methods for modulating the immune response caused by oligonucleotide compounds. The methods according to the invention enable modifying the cytokine profile produced by immunostimulatory oligonucleotides for immunotherapy applications. The present inventors have surprisingly discovered that modification of immunostimulatory dinucleotides allows flexibility in the nature of the immune response produced and that certain modifications overcome the species specificities observed to date of the immunostimulatory sequences. In certain preferred embodiments, the modified dinucleotide is in the context of an &#x201c;immunomer&#x201d;, as further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a first aspect, therefore, the invention provides immunostimulatory oligonucleotides or immunomers comprising at least one immunostimulatory dinucleotide comprising at least one modified purine or pyrimidine.</p>

In another preferred embodiment, the immunomodulatory oligonucleotide or immunomer comprises an immunostimulatory dinucleotide of formula 5&#x2032;-Pur*-Pur-3&#x2032;, wherein Pur* is a non-natural purine nucleoside and Pur is a natural or non-natural purine nucleoside. A particularly preferred synthetic purine is 2-oxo-7-deaza-8-methyl-purine.

In certain preferred embodiments, the immunostimulatory dinucleotide is not CpG.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In yet another embodiment, the immunomodulatory oligonucleotide comprises an immunostimulatory domain of formula (III):

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">provided that at least one N1 or Nn is optionally an immunostimulatory moiety;</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">wherein n is a number from 0-30;</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">wherein the 3&#x2032; end, an internucleotide linkage, or a functionalized nucleobase or sugar may or may not be linked directly or via a non-nucleotidic linker to another oligonucleotide, which may or may not be immunostimulatory.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The invention relates to the therapeutic use of oligonucleotides as immunostimulatory agents for immunotherapy applications. The issued patents, patent applications, and references that are cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. In the event of inconsistencies between any teaching of any reference cited herein and the present specification, the latter shall prevail for purposes of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The invention provides methods for enhancing the immune response caused by immunostimulatory compounds used for immunotherapy applications such as, but not limited to, treatment of cancer, autoimmune disorders, asthma, respiratory allergies, food allergies, and bacteria, parasitic, and viral infections in adult and pediatric human and veterinary applications. Thus, the invention further provides compounds having optimal levels of immunostimulatory effect for immunotherapy and methods for making and using such compounds. In addition, compounds of the invention are useful as adjuvants in combination with DNA vaccines, antibodies, and allergens; and in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and/or antisense oligonucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The present inventors have surprisingly discovered that modification of an immunomodulatory oligonucleotide to optimally present its 5&#x2032; ends dramatically affects its immunostimulatory capabilities. In addition, the present inventors have discovered that the cytokine profile and species specificity of an immune response can be modulated by using novel purine or pyrimidine structures as part of an immunomodulatory oligonucleotide or an immunomer.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a first aspect, the invention provides immunostimulatory oligonucleotides or &#x201c;immunomers&#x201d;, the latter comprising at least two oligonucleotides linked at their 3&#x2032; ends, or an internucleoside linkage or a functionalized nucleobase or sugar to a non-nucleotidic linker, at least one of the oligonucleotides being an immunomodulatory oligonucleotide and having an accessible 5&#x2032; end. As used herein, the term &#x201c;accessible 5&#x2032; end&#x201d; means that the 5&#x2032; end of the oligonucleotide is sufficiently available such that the factors that recognize and bind to immunomers and stimulate the immune system have access to it. In oligonucleotides having an accessible 5&#x2032; end, the 5&#x2032; OH position of the terminal sugar is not covalently linked to more than two nucleoside residues or any other moiety that interferes with interaction with the 5&#x2032; end. Optionally, the 5&#x2032; OH can be linked to a phosphate, phosphorothioate, or phosphorodithioate moiety, an aromatic or aliphatic linker, cholesterol, or another entity which does not interfere with accessibility.

<p id="p-0123" num="0124">The immunomers according to the invention comprise at least two oligonucleotides linked at their 3&#x2032; ends or internucleoside linkage or a functionalized nucleobase or sugar via a non-nucleotidic linker. For purposes of the invention, a &#x201c;non-nucleotidic linker&#x201d; is any moiety that can be linked to the oligonucleotides by way of covalent or non-covalent linkages. Preferably such linker is from about 2 angstroms to about 200 angstroms in length. Several examples of preferred linkers are set forth below. Non-covalent linkages include, but are not limited to, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interactions, &#x3c0;-stacking interactions, and hydrogen bonding. The term &#x201c;non-nucleotidic linker&#x201d; is not meant to refer to an internucleoside linkage, as described above, e.g., a phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, or phosphorodithioate functional group, that directly connects the 3&#x2032;-hydroxyl groups of two nucleosides. For purposes of this invention, such a direct 3&#x2032;-3&#x2032; linkage (no linker involved) is considered to be a &#x201c;nucleotidic linkage.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0125">In some embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker is a metal, including, without limitation, gold particles. In some other embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker is a soluble or insoluble biodegradable polymer bead.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0126">In yet other embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker is an organic moiety having functional groups that permit attachment to the oligonucleotide. Such attachment preferably is by any stable covalent linkage. As a non-limiting example, the linker may be attached to any suitable position on the nucleoside, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In some preferred embodiments, the linker is attached to the 3&#x2032;-hydroxyl. In such embodiments, the linker preferably comprises a hydroxyl functional group, which preferably is attached to the 3&#x2032;-hydroxyl by means of a phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate or non-phosphate-based linkages.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0127">In some embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker is a biomolecule, including, without limitation, polypeptides, antibodies, lipids, antigens, allergens, and oligosaccharides. In some other embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker is a small molecule. For purposes of the invention, a small molecule is an organic moiety having a molecular weight of less than 1,000 Da. In some embodiments, the small molecule has a molecular weight of less than 750 Da.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0128">In some embodiments, the small molecule is an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, either of which optionally can include, either in the linear chain connecting the oligonucleotides or appended to it, one or more functional groups selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, amino, thiol, thioether, ether, amide, thioamide, ester, urea, and thiourea. The small molecule can be cyclic or acyclic. Examples of small molecule linkers include, but are not limited to, amino acids, carbohydrates, cyclodextrins, adamantane, cholesterol, haptens and antibiotics. However, for purposes of describing the non-nucleotidic linker, the term &#x201c;small molecule&#x201d; is not intended to include a nucleoside.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0129">In some embodiments, the small molecule linker is glycerol or a glycerol homolog of the formula HO&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>o</sub>&#x2014;CH(OH)&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>p</sub>&#x2014;OH, wherein o and p independently are integers from 1 to about 6, from 1 to about 4, or from 1 to about 3. In some other embodiments, the small molecule linker is a derivative of 1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane. Some such derivatives have the formula HO&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>&#x2014;C(O)NH&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH(OH)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;NHC(O)&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>&#x2014;OH, wherein m is an integer from 0 to about 10, from 0 to about 6, from 2 to about 6, or from 2 to about 4.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0130">Some non-nucleotidic linkers according to the invention permit attachment of more than two oligonucleotides, as schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the small molecule linker glycerol has three hydroxyl groups to which oligonucleotides may be covalently attached. Some immunomers according to the invention, therefore, comprise more than two oligonucleotides linked at their 3&#x2032; ends to a non-nucleotidic linker. Some such immunomers comprise at least two immunostimulatory oligonucleotides, each having an accessible 5&#x2032; end.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0131">The immunomers of the invention may conveniently be synthesized using an automated synthesizer and phosphoramidite approach as schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, and further described in the Examples. In some embodiments, the immunomers are synthesized by a linear synthesis approach (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). As used herein, the term &#x201c;linear synthesis&#x201d; refers to a synthesis that starts at one end of the immunomer and progresses linearly to the other end. Linear synthesis permits incorporation of either identical or un-identical (in terms of length, base composition and/or chemical modifications incorporated) monomeric units into the immunomers.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0132">An alternative mode of synthesis is &#x201c;parallel synthesis&#x201d;, in which synthesis proceeds outward from a central linker moiety (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). A solid support attached linker can be used for parallel synthesis, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,332. Alternatively, a universal solid support (such as phosphate attached controlled pore glass) support can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0133">Parallel synthesis of immunomers has several advantages over linear synthesis: (1) parallel synthesis permits the incorporation of identical monomeric units; (2) unlike in linear synthesis, both (or all) the monomeric units are synthesized at the same time, thereby the number of synthetic steps and the time required for the synthesis is the same as that of a monomeric unit; and (3) the reduction in synthetic steps improves purity and yield of the final immunomer product.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0134">At the end of the synthesis by either linear synthesis or parallel synthesis protocols, the immunomers may conveniently be deprotected with concentrated ammonia solution or as recommended by the phosphoramidite supplier, if a modified nucleoside is incorporated. The product immunomer is preferably purified by reversed phase HPLC, detritylated, desalted and dialyzed.</p>

<p id="p-0137" num="0138">In a second aspect, the invention provides immunomodulatory oligonucleotide conjugates and immunomer conjugates, comprising an immunomodulatory oligonucleotide or an immunomer, as described above, and an antigen conjugated to the immunomer at a position other than the accessible 5&#x2032; end. In some embodiments, the non-nucleotidic linker comprises an antigen, which is conjugated to the oligonucleotide. In some other embodiments, the antigen is conjugated to the oligonucleotide at a position other than its 3&#x2032; end. In some embodiments, the antigen produces a vaccine effect.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0139">The antigen is preferably selected from the group consisting of antigens associated with a pathogen, antigens associated with a cancer, antigens associated with an auto-immune disorder, and antigens associated with other diseases such as, but not limited to, veterinary or pediatric diseases. For purposes of the invention, the term &#x201c;associated with&#x201d; means that the antigen is present when the pathogen, cancer, auto-immune disorder, food allergy, respiratory allergy, asthma or other disease is present, but either is not present, or is present in reduced amounts, when the pathogen, cancer, auto-immune disorder, food allergy, respiratory allergy, or disease is absent.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0140">The immunomodulatory oligonucleotide or immunomer is covalently linked to the antigen, or it is otherwise operatively associated with the antigen. As used herein, the term &#x201c;operatively associated with&#x201d; refers to any association that maintains the activity of both immunomer and antigen. Nonlimiting examples of such operative associations include being part of the same liposome or other such delivery vehicle or reagent. In embodiments wherein the immunomer is covalently linked to the antigen, such covalent linkage preferably is at any position on the immunomer other than an accessible 5&#x2032; end of an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide. For example, the antigen may be attached at an internucleoside linkage or may be attached to the non-nucleotidic linker. Alternatively, the antigen may itself be the non-nucleotidic linker.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0141">In a third aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising an immunomodulatory oligonucleotide, immunomodulatory oligonucleotide conjugate, immunomer or immunomer conjugate according to the invention and a physiologically acceptable carrier. As used herein, the term &#x201c;physiologically acceptable&#x201d; refers to a material that does not interfere with the effectiveness of the immunomer and is compatible with a biological system such as a cell, cell culture, tissue, or organism. Preferably, the biological system is a living organism, such as a vertebrate.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0142">As used herein, the term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; encompasses any excipient, diluent, filler, salt, buffer, stabilizer, solubilizer, lipid, or other material well known in the art for use in pharmaceutical formulations. It will be understood that the characteristics of the carrier, excipient, or diluent will depend on the route of administration for a particular application. The preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable formulations containing these materials is described in, e.g., <i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, </i>18th Edition, ed. A. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0143">In a fourth aspect, the invention provides methods for generating an immune response in a vertebrate, such methods comprising administering to the vertebrate an immunomodulatory oligonucleotide, immunomodulatory oligonucleotide conjugate, immunomer or immunomer conjugate according to the invention. In some embodiments, the vertebrate is a mammal. For purposes of this invention, the term &#x201c;mammal&#x201d; is expressly intended to include humans. In preferred embodiments, the immunomer or immunomer conjugate is administered to a vertebrate in need of immunostimulation.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0144">In the methods according to this aspect of the invention, administration of immunomodulatory oligonucleotide, immunomodulatory oligonucleotide conjugate, immunomer or immunomer conjugate can be by any suitable route, including, without limitation, parenteral, oral, sublingual, transdermal, topical, intranasal, aerosol, intraocular, intratracheal, intrarectal, vaginal, by gene gun, dermal patch or in eye drop or mouthwash form. Administration of the therapeutic compositions of immunomers can be carried out using known procedures at dosages and for periods of time effective to reduce symptoms or surrogate markers of the disease. When administered systemically, the therapeutic composition is preferably administered at a sufficient dosage to attain a blood level of immunomer from about 0.0001 micromolar to about 10 micromolar. For localized administration, much lower concentrations than this may be effective, and much higher concentrations may be tolerated. Preferably, a total dosage of immunomer ranges from about 0.001 mg per patient per day to about 200 mg per kg body weight per day. It may be desirable to administer simultaneously, or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the therapeutic compositions of the invention to an individual as a single treatment episode.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0145">In certain preferred embodiments, immunomodulatory oligonucleotide, immunomodulatory oligonucleotide conjugate, immunomer or immunomer conjugate according to the invention are administered in combination with vaccines, antibodies, cytotoxic agents, allergens, antibiotics, antisense oligonucleotides, peptides, proteins, gene therapy vectors, DNA vaccines and/or adjuvants to enhance the specificity or magnitude of the immune response. In these embodiments, the immunomers of the invention can variously act as adjuvants and/or produce direct immunostimulatory effects.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0146">Either the immunomodulatory oligonucleotide, immunomodulatory oligonucleotide conjugate, immunomer, immunomer conjugate or the vaccine, or both, may optionally be linked to an immunogenic protein, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), cholera toxin B subunit, or any other immunogenic carrier protein. Any of the plethora of adjuvants may be used including, without limitation, Freund's complete adjuvant, KLH, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), alum, and saponins, including QS-21, imiquimod, R848, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0147">For purposes of this aspect of the invention, the term &#x201c;in combination with&#x201d; means in the course of treating the same disease in the same patient, and includes administering the immunomer and/or the vaccine and/or the adjuvant in any order, including simultaneous administration, as well as temporally spaced order of up to several days apart. Such combination treatment may also include more than a single administration of the immunomer, and/or independently the vaccine, and/or independently the adjuvant. The administration of the immunomer and/or vaccine and/or adjuvant may be by the same or different routes.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0148">The methods according to this aspect of the invention are useful for model studies of the immune system. The methods are also useful for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of human or animal disease. For example, the methods are useful for pediatric and veterinary vaccine applications.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0149">In a fifth aspect, the invention provides methods for therapeutically treating a patient having a disease or disorder, such methods comprising administering to the patient an immunomodulatory oligonucleotide, immunomodulatory oligonucleotide conjugate, immunomer or immunomer conjugate according to the invention. In various embodiments, the disease or disorder to be treated is cancer, an autoimmune disorder, airway inflammation, inflammatory disorders, allergy, asthma or a disease caused by a pathogen. Pathogens include bacteria, parasites, fungi, viruses, viroids and prions. Administration is carried out as described for the fourth aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0150">For purposes of the invention, the term &#x201c;allergy&#x201d; includes, without limitation, food allergies and respiratory allergies. The term &#x201c;airway inflammation&#x201d; includes, without limitation, asthma. As used herein, the term &#x201c;autoimmune disorder&#x201d; refers to disorders in which &#x201c;self&#x201d; proteins undergo attack by the immune system. Such term includes autoimmune asthma.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0151">In any of the methods according to this aspect of the invention, the immunomodulatory oligonucleotide, immunomodulatory oligonucleotide conjugate, immunomer or immunomer conjugate can be administered in combination with any other agent useful for treating the disease or condition that does not diminish the immunostimulatory effect of the immunomer. For example, in the treatment of cancer, it is contemplated that the immunomodulatory oligonucleotide, immunomodulatory oligonucleotide conjugate, immunomer or immunomer conjugate may be administered in combination with a chemotherapeutic compound.</p>

The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. These results demonstrate that at the higher concentrations, Immunomer 6, having two accessible 5&#x2032; ends results in greater splenocyte proliferation than does Immunomer 5, having no accessible 5&#x2032; end or Oligonucleotide 4, with a single accessible 5&#x2032; end. Immunomer 6 also causes greater splenocyte proliferation than the LPS positive control.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">In Vivo Splenomegaly Assays</heading>
<p id="p-0156" num="0157">To test the applicability of the in vitro results to an in vivo model, selected oligonucleotides were administered to mice and the degree of splenomegaly was measured as an indicator of the level of immunostimulatory activity. A single dose of 5 mg/kg was administered to BALB/c mice (female, 4-6 weeks old, Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc, Baltic, Conn.) intraperitoneally. The mice were sacrificed 72 hours after oligonucleotide administration, and spleens were harvested and weighed. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. These results demonstrate that Immunomer 6, having two accessible 5&#x2032; ends, has a far greater immunostimulatory effect than do Oligonucleotide 4 or Immunomer 5.</p>

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Cytokine Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0157" num="0158">The secretion of IL-12 and IL-6 in vertebrate cells, preferably BALB/c mouse spleen cells or human PBMC, was measured by sandwich ELISA. The required reagents including cytokine antibodies and cytokine standards were purchased form PharMingen, San Diego, Calif. ELISA plates (Costar) were incubated with appropriate antibodies at 5 &#x3bc;g/mL in PBSN buffer (PBS/0.05% sodium azide, pH 9.6) overnight at 4&#xb0; C. and then blocked with PBS/1% BSA at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. Cell culture supernatants and cytokine standards were appropriately diluted with PBS/10% FBS, added to the plates in triplicate, and incubated at 25&#xb0; C. for 2 hours. Plates were overlaid with 1 &#x3bc;g/mL appropriate biotinylated antibody and incubated at 25&#xb0; C. for 1.5 hours. The plates were then washed extensively with PBS-T Buffer (PBS/0.05% Tween 20) and further incubated at 25&#xb0; C. for 1.5 hours after adding streptavidin conjugated peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). The plates were developed with Sure Blue&#x2122; (Kirkegaard and Perry) chromogenic reagent and the reaction was terminated by adding Stop Solution (Kirkegaard and Perry). The color change was measured on a Ceres 900 HDI Spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments). The results are shown in Table 5A below.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0159">Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque-1077, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). Briefly, heparinized blood was layered onto the Histopaque-1077 (equal volume) in a conical centrifuge and centrifuged at 400&#xd7;g for 30 minutes at room temperature. The buffy coat, containing the mononuclear cells, was removed carefully and washed twice with isotonic phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugation at 250&#xd7;g for 10 minutes. The resulting cell pellet was then resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing L-glutamine (MediaTech, Inc., Herndon, Va.) and supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS and penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/ml). Cells were cultured in 24 well plates for different time periods at 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml/well in the presence or absence of oligonucleotides. At the end of the incubation period, supernatants were harvested and stored frozen at &#x2212;70&#xb0; C. until assayed for various cytokines including IL-6 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.), IL-10 (BD Pharmingen), IL-12 (BioSource International, Camarillo, Calif.), IFN-&#x3b1; (BioSource International) and -&#x3b3; (BD Pharmingen) and TNF-&#x3b1; (BD Pharmingen) by sandwich ELISA. The results are shown in Table 5 below.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0160">In all instances, the levels of IL-12 and IL-6 in the cell culture supernatants were calculated from the standard curve constructed under the same experimental conditions for IL-12 and IL-6, respectively. The levels of IL-10, IFN-gamma and TNF-&#x3b1; in the cell culture supernatants were calculated from the standard curve constructed under the same experimental conditions for IL-10, IFN-gamma and TNF-&#x3b1;, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0163" num="0164">In order to study the effect of length of the oligonucleotide chains, immunomers containing 18, 14, 11, and 8 nucleotides in each chain were synthesized and tested for immunostimulatory activity, as measured by their ability to induce secretion of the cytokines IL-12 and IL-6 in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures (Tables 6-8). In this, and all subsequent examples, cytokine assays were carried out in BALB/c spleen cell cultures as described in Example 4.</p>

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Effect of the Linker on Immunostimulatory Activity</heading>
<p id="p-0172" num="0173">In order to examine the effect of the length of the linker connecting the two oligonucleotides, immunomers that contained the same oligonucleotides, but different linkers were synthesized and tested for immunostimulatory activity. The results shown in Table 12 suggest that linker length plays a role in the immunostimulatory activity of immunomers. The best immunostimulatory effect was achieved with C3- to C6-alkyl linkers or abasic linkers having interspersed phosphate charges.</p>

<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Effect of Oligonucleotide Backbone on Immunostimulatory Activity</heading>
<p id="p-0174" num="0175">In general, immunostimulatory oligonucleotides that contain natural phosphodiester backbones are less immunostimulatory than are the same length oligonucleotides with a phosphorothioate backbones. This lower degree of immunostimulatory activity could be due in part to the rapid degradation of phosphodiester oligonucleotides under experimental conditions. Degradation of oligonucleotides is primarily the result of 3&#x2032;-exonucleases, which digest the oligonucleotides from the 3&#x2032; end. The immunomers of this example do not contain a free 3&#x2032; end. Thus, immunomers with phosphodiester backbones should have a longer half life under experimental conditions than the corresponding monomeric oligonucleotides, and should therefore exhibit improved immunostimulatory activity. The results presented in Table 13 demonstrate this effect, with Immunomers 84 and 85 exhibiting immunostimulatory activity as determined by cytokine induction in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures.</p>

<p id="p-0176" num="0177">Oligonucleotides were synthesized on 1 &#x3bc;mol scale using an automated DNA synthesizer (Expedite 8909 PerSeptive Biosystems). Deoxynucleoside phosphoramidites were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.). 7-Deaza-2&#x2032;-deoxyguanosine phosphoramidite was obtained from Glen Research (Sterling Va.). 1,3-Bis-DMT-glycerol-CPG was obtained from ChemGenes (Ashland, Mass.). Modified nucleosides were incorporated into the oligonucleotides at specific site using normal coupling cycles. After the synthesis, oligonucleotides were deprotected using concentrated ammonium hydroxide and purified by reversed-phase HPLC, followed by dialysis. Purified oligonucleotides as sodium salt form were lyophilized prior to use. Purity of oligonucleotides was checked by CGE and MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Proflex III MALDI-TOF Mass spectrometer).</p>

<p id="p-0179" num="0180">BALB/c mouse (4-8 weeks) spleen cells were cultured in RPMI complete medium. Murine macrophage-like cells, J774 (American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and antibiotics (100 IU/mL of penicillin G/streptomycin). All other culture reagents were purchased from Mediatech (Gaithersburg, Md.).</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0181">ELISAs for IL-12 and IL-6. BALB/c mouse spleen or J774 cells were plated in 24-well dishes at a density of 5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>or 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL, respectively. The CpG DNA dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) was added to a final concentration of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0 &#x3bc;g/mL to mouse spleen cell cultures and 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0 &#x3bc;g/mL to J774 cell cultures. The cells were then incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 24 hr and the supernatants were collected for ELISA assays. The experiments were performed two or three times for each CpG DNA in triplicate for each concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0182">The secretion of IL-12 and IL-6 was measured by sandwich ELISA. The required reagents, including cytokine antibodies and standards were purchased from PharMingen. ELISA plates (Costar) were incubated with appropriate antibodies at 5 &#x3bc;g/mL in PBSN buffer (PBS/0.05% sodium azide, pH 9.6) overnight at 4&#xb0; C. and then blocked with PBS/1% BSA at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min. Cell culture supernatants and cytokine standards were appropriately diluted with PBS/1% BSA, added to the plates in triplicate, and incubated at 25&#xb0; C. for 2 hr. Plates were washed and incubated with 1 &#x3bc;g/mL of appropriate biotinylated antibody and incubated at 25&#xb0; C. for 1.5 hr. The plates were washed extensively with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and then further incubated at 25&#xb0; C. for 1.5 hr after the addition of streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase (Sigma). The plates were developed with Sure Blue&#x2122; (Kirkegaard and Perry) chromogenic reagent and the reaction was terminated by adding Stop Solution (Kirkegaard and Perry). The color change was measured on a Ceres 900 HDI Spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments) at 450 mm. The levels of IL-12 and IL-6 in the cell culture supernatants were calculated from the standard curve constructed under the same experimental conditions for IL-12 and IL-6, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0185" num="0186">Taken together, the current results suggest that an accessible 5&#x2032;-end of CpG DNA is required for its optimal immunostimulatory activity and smaller groups such as a phosphorothioate, a mononucleotide, or a dinucleotide do not effectively block the accessibility of the 5&#x2032;-end of CpG DNA to receptors or factors involved in the immunostimulatory pathway. However, the conjugation of molecules as large as fluorescein or larger at the 5&#x2032;-end of CpG DNA could abrogate immunostimulatory activity. These results have a direct impact on the studies of immunostimulatory activity of CpG DNA-antigen/vaccine/monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugates. The conjugation of large molecules such as vaccines or mAbs at the 5&#x2032;-end of a CpG DNA could lead to suboptimal immunostimulatory activity of CpG DNA. The conjugation of functional ligands at the 3&#x2032;-end of CpG DNA not only contributes to increased nuclease stability but also increased immunostimulatory potency of CpG DNA in vivo.</p>

<p id="p-0188" num="0189">To evaluate the optimal linker size for potentiation of immunostimulatory activity, we measured IL-12 and IL-6 secretion induced by modified CpG DNAs in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures. All CpG DNAs induced concentration-dependent IL-12 and IL-6 secretion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows data obtained at 1 &#x3bc;g/mL concentration of selected CpG DNAs, 116, 119, 126, 130, and 134, which had a linker at the fifth nucleotide position in the 5&#x2032;-flanking sequence to the CpG dinucleotide compared with the parent CpG DNA. The CpG DNAs, which contained C2-(1), C3-(2), and C4-linkers (3), induced secretion of IL-12 production similar to that of the parent CpG DNA 4. The CpG DNA that contained C6 and C9-linkers (4 and 5) at the fifth nucleotide position from CpG dinucleotide in the 5&#x2032;-flanking sequence induced lower levels of IL-12 secretion than did the parent CpG DNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), suggesting that substitution of linkers longer than a C4-linker results in the induction of lower levels of IL-12. All five CpG DNAs, which had linkers, induced two to three times higher IL-6 secretion than did the parent CpG DNA. The presence of a linker in these CpG DNAs showed a significant effect on the induction of IL-6 compared with CpG DNAs that did not have a linker. However, we did not observe length-dependent linker effect on IL-6 secretion.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0190">To examine the effect on immunostimulatory activity of CpG DNA containing ethyleneglycol-linkers, we synthesized CpG DNAs 137 and 138, in which a triethyleneglycol-linker (6) is incorporated at the fifth nucleotide position in the 5&#x2032;- and at the fourth nucleotide position in the 3&#x2032;-flanking sequences to the CpG dinucleotide, respectively. Similarly, CpG DNAs 139 and 140 contained a hexaethyleneglycol-linker (7) in the 5&#x2032;- or the 3&#x2032;-flanking sequence to the CpG dinucleotide, respectively. All four modified CpG DNAs (137-140) were tested in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures for cytokine induction (IL-12, IL-6, and IL-10) in comparison with parent CpG DNA 4. All CpG DNAs induced concentration-dependent cytokine production over the concentration range tested (0.03-10.0 &#x3bc;g/mL) (data not shown). The levels of cytokines induced at 0.3 &#x3bc;g/mL concentration of CpG DNAs 137-140 are shown in Table 18. CpG DNAs 137 and 139, which had an ethyleneglycol-linker in the 5&#x2032;-flanking sequence induced higher levels of IL-12 (2106&#xb1;143 and 2066&#xb1;153 pg/mL) and IL-6 (2362&#xb1;166 and 2507&#xb1;66 pg/mL) secretion than did parent CpG DNA 4 (Table 18). At the same concentration, 137 and 139 induced slightly lower levels of IL-10 secretion than did the parent CpG DNA (Table 18). CpG DNA 138, which had a shorter ethyleneglycol-linker (6) in the 3&#x2032;-flanking sequence induced IL-12 secretion similar to that of the parent CpG DNA, but significantly lower levels of IL-6 and IL-10 (Table 18). CpG DNA 140, which had a longer ethyleneglycol-linker (7) induced significantly lower levels of all three cytokines tested compared with the parent CpG DNA (Table 18).</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0191">Though triethyleneglycol-linker (6) had a chain length similar to that of C9-linker (5), the CpG DNA containing triethyleneglycol-linker had better immunostimulatory activity than did CpG DNA containing C9-linker, as determined by induction of cytokine secretion in spleen cell cultures. These results suggest that the lower immunostimulatory activity observed with CpG DNA containing longer alkyl-linkers (4 and 5) may not be related to their increased length but to their hydrophobic characteristics. This observation prompted us to examine substitution of branched alkyl-linkers containing hydrophilic functional groups on immunostimulatory activity.</p>

<p id="p-0194" num="0195">Parent CpG DNA 4 showed a proliferation index of 3.7&#xb1;0.8 at a concentration of 0.1 &#x3bc;g/mL. At the same concentration, modified CpG DNAs 151-154 containing amino-linker 9 at different positions caused higher spleen cell proliferation than did the parent CpG DNA (Table 19). As observed with other linkers, when the substitution was placed adjacent to CpG dinucleotide (150), a lower proliferation index was noted compared with parent CpG DNA (Table 19), further confirming that the placement of a linker substitution adjacent to CpG dinucleotide has a detrimental effect on immunostimulatory activity. In general, substitution of an amino-linker for 2&#x2032;-deoxyribonucleoside in the 5&#x2032;-flanking sequence (151 and 152) resulted in higher spleen cell proliferation than found with the substitution in the 3&#x2032;-flanking sequence (153 and 154). Similar results were observed in the splenomegaly assay (Table 19), confirming the results observed in spleen cell cultures. Modified CpG DNAs containing glycerol-linker (8) showed immunostimulatory activity similar to or slightly higher that that observed with modified CpG DNA containing amino-linker (9) (data not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0196">In order to compare the immunostimulatory effects of CpG DNA containing linkers 8 and 9, we selected CpG DNAs 145 and 152, which had substitution in the 5&#x2032;-flanking sequence and assayed their ability to induce cytokines IL-12 and IL-6 secretion in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures. Both CpG DNAs 145 and 152 induced concentration-dependent cytokine secretion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the levels of IL-12 and IL-6 induced by 145 and 152 in mouse spleen cell cultures at 0.3 &#x3bc;g/mL concentration compared with parent CpG DNA 4. Both CpG DNAs induced higher levels of IL-12 and IL-6 than did parent CpG DNA 4. CpG DNA containing glycerol-linker (8) induced slightly higher levels of cytokines (especially IL-12) than did CpG DNA containing amino-linker (9) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). These results further confirm that the linkers containing hydrophilic groups are more favorable for immunostimulatory activity of CpG DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0197">We examined two different aspects of multiple linker substitutions in CpG DNA. In one set of experiments, we kept the length of nucleotide sequence to 13-mer and incorporated one to five C3-linker (2) substitutions at the 5&#x2032;-end (120-124). These modified CpG DNAs permitted us to study the effect of an increase in the length of linkers without causing solubility problems. In the second set of experiments, we incorporated two of the same linker substitutions (3, 4, or 5) in adjacent positions in the 5&#x2032;-flanking sequence to the CpG dinucleotide to study if there would be any additive effect on immunostimulatory activity.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0198">Modified CpG DNAs were studied for their ability to induce cytokine production in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures in comparison with parent CpG DNA 4. All CpG DNAs induced concentration-dependent cytokine production. The data obtained at 1.0 &#x3bc;g/mL concentration of CpG DNAs is shown in Table 20. In this assay, parent CpG DNA 4 induced 967&#xb1;28 pg/mL of IL-12, 1593&#xb1;94 pg/mL of IL-6, and 14&#xb1;6 pg/mL of IL-10 secretion at 1 &#x3bc;g/mL of concentration. The data presented in Table 20 suggest that as the number of linker substitutions decreased IL-12 induction decreased. However, the induction of lower levels of IL-12 secretion by CpG DNAs 123 and 124 could be the result of the shorter length of CpG DNAs. Our studies with unmodified CpG DNA shorter than 15-nucleotides showed insignificant immunostimulatory activity (data not shown). Neither length nor the number of linker substitutions have a lesser effect on IL-6 secretion. Though IL-10 secretion increased with linker substitutions, the overall IL-10 secretion by these CpG DNAs was minimal.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0199">CpG DNAs containing two linker substitutions (linker 3-127; linker-4-131; linker-5-135) at the fourth and fifth positions in the 5&#x2032;-flanking sequences to the CpG dinucleotide and the corresponding 5&#x2032;-truncated versions 128, 132, and 136, respectively, were tested for their ability to induce cytokine secretion in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures. The levels of IL-12 and IL-6 secreted at 1.0 &#x3bc;g/mL concentration are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The results presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> suggest that the immunostimulatory activity is dependent on the nature of the linker incorporated. The substitution of the fourth and fifth nucleosides with C4-linker 3 (CpG DNA 127) had an insignificant effect on cytokine secretion compared with parent CpG DNA 4, suggesting that the nucleobase and sugar ring at these positions are not required for receptor recognition and/or binding. The deletion of the nucleotides beyond the linker substitutions (CpG DNA 128) caused higher IL-12 and IL-6 secretion than that found with CpG DNAs 4 and 127. As expected, the substitution of two C6-linkers (4) resulted in IL-12 secretion lower than and IL-6 secretion similar to that induced by parent CpG DNA 4. The 5&#x2032;-truncated CpG DNA 132 induced higher cytokine secretion than did CpG DNA 131. The CpG DNAs 135 and 136, which had two C9-linkers (5), induced insignificant cytokine secretion, confirming the results obtained with mono-substituted CpG DNA containing the same linker as described above.</p>

<p id="p-0201" num="0202">PS-CpG DNA 4 (Table 21) was found to induce an immune response in mice (data not shown) with PO-CpG DNA 155 serving as a control. PO-immunomers 156 and 157 each contain two identical, truncated copies of the parent CpG DNA 155 joined through their 3&#x2032;-ends via a glyceryl linker, X (Table 21). While 156 and 157 each contain the same oligonucleotide segments of 14 bases, the 5&#x2032;-ends of 157 were modified by the addition of two C3-linkers, Y (Table 21). All oligonucleotides 4, 155-157 contain a &#x2018;GACGTT&#x2019; hexameric motif known to activate the mouse immune system.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0203">The stability of PO-immunomers against nucleases was assessed by incubating CpG DNAs 4, 155-157 in cell culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (non-heat-inactivated) at 37&#xb0; C. for 4, 24, and 48 hr. Intact CpG DNA remaining in the reaction mixtures were then determined by CGE. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref> A-D shows the nuclease digestion profiles of CpG DNAs 4, 155-157 incubated in 10% FBS for 24 hr. The amount of full-length CpG DNA remaining at each time point is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref>. As expected, the parent PS-CpG DNA 4 is the most resistant to serum nucleases. About 55% of 18-mer 4 remained undegraded after 48 hr incubation. In contrast, only about 5% of full-length PO-immunomer 155 remained after 4 hr under the same experimental conditions confirming that DNA containing phosphodiester linkages undergoes rapid degradation. As expected, both PO-immunomers 156 and 157 were more resistant than 155 to serum nucleases. After 4 hr, about 62% and 73% of 156 and 157 respectively were intact compared with about 5% of 155 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref>). Even after 48 hr, about 23% and 37% of 156 and 157, respectively, remained undegraded. As well as showing that 3&#x2032;-3&#x2032;-linked PO-immunomers are more stable against serum nucleases, these studies indicate that chemical modifications at the 5&#x2032;-end can further increase nuclease stability.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0204">The immunostimulatory activity of CpG DNAs was studied in BALB/c and C3H/HeJ mice spleen cell cultures by measuring levels of cytokines IL-12 and IL-6 secreted. All CpG DNAs induced a concentration-dependent cytokine secretion in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). At 3 &#x3bc;g/mL, PS-CpG DNA 4 induced 2656&#xb1;256 and 12234&#xb1;1180 pg/mL of IL-12 and IL-6 respectively. The parent PO-CpG DNA 155 did not raise cytokine levels above background except at a concentration of 10 &#x3bc;g/mL. This observation is consistent with the nuclease stability assay results. In contrast, PO-immunomers 156 and 157 induced both IL-12 and IL-6 secretion in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0205">The results presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> show a clear distinction in cytokine induction profiles of PS- and PO-CpG DNAs. PO-immunomers 156 and 157 induced higher levels of IL-12 than did PS-CpG DNA 4 in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>). In contrast, at concentrations up to 3 &#x3bc;g/mL, they produced negligible amounts of IL-6 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>). Even at the highest concentration (10 &#x3bc;g/mL), PO-immunomer 156 induced significantly less IL-6 than did PS-CpG DNA 4. The presence of C3 linkers at the 5&#x2032;-terminus of PO-immunomer 157 resulted in slightly higher levels of IL-6 secretion compared with 156. However, importantly, the levels of IL-6 produced by PO-immunomer 157 are much lower than those induced by PS CpG DNA 4. The inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> shows the ratio of IL-12 to IL-6 secreted at 3 &#x3bc;g/mL concentration. In addition to increasing IL-12 secretion, PO-immunomers 156 and 157 induced higher levels of IFN-&#x3b3; than did PS-CpG DNA 4 in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures (data not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0206">The different cytokine profiles induced by PO- and PS-CpG DNAs in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures prompted us to study the pattern of cytokine induction of CpG DNAs in C3H/HeJ mouse spleen cell cultures (an LPS lower-responsive strain). All three CpG DNAs tested in this assay induced concentration-dependent cytokine secretion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A</figref> and B). Since PO-CpG DNA 155 failed to induce cytokine secretion in BALB/c mouse spleen cell cultures, it was not further tested in C3H/HeJ spleen cell cultures. Both PO-immunomers 156 and 157 induced higher IL-12 production than did PS-CpG DNA 4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>). However, at concentrations up to 3 &#x3bc;g/mL, neither induced IL-6 production. At the highest concentration tested (10 &#x3bc;g/mL), both induced significantly less IL-6 than did PS-CpG DNA 4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>). The ratio of IL-12 to IL-6 secreted is calculated to distinguish cytokine secretion profiles of PS and PO CpG DNAs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> inset). In addition, the C3H/HeJ spleen cell culture results suggest that the responses observed with CpG DNAs are not due to LPS contamination.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0207">PS-CpG DNAs have been shown to induce potent antitumor activity in vivo. Since PO-CpG DNAs exhibited greater nuclease stability and induced higher levels of IL-12 and IFN-&#x3b3; secretion in in vitro assays, we were interested to see if these desirable properties of PO-immunomers improve the antitumor activity in vivo. We administered PO-immunomer 157 subcutaneously at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg every other day to nude mice bearing tumor xenografts of MCF-7 breast cancer cells that express wild-type p53, or DU-145 prostate cancer cells that express mutated p53. PO-immunomer 157 gave 57% growth inhibition of MCF-7 tumors on day 15 compared with the saline control (FIG. <b>22</b>A). It also produced 52% growth inhibition of DU-145 tumors on day 34 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>). These antitumor studies suggest that PO-immunomers of the proposed design exhibit potent antitumor activity in vivo.</p>

<p id="p-0209" num="0210">Mouse splenocyte cultures were prepared and treated as described in Example 4. Cultures were treated with medium or with oligonucleotides 170, 171, or 172. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). All oligonucleotides contained mouse-specific immunostimulatory motifs (GACGTT), but oligonucleotide 171 contained an RpG substitution and oligonucleotide 172 contained a CpR substitution, wherein R is 2-oxo-7-deaza-8-methyl-purine. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The RpG substitution was recognized by the mouse spleen cultures resulting in cytokine production, whereas the CpR substitution was not. Treatment of the cultures with oligonucleotides 173 or 174, containing a human-specific immunostimulatory motif GTCGTT or with an RpG substitution, respectively, showed better recognition by the mouse splenocytes with the RpG substitution than with the native human sequence (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). Treatment with parent oligonucleotides 170 (mouse-specific) or 173 (human-specific), compared with their respective immunomers 175 or 176 (each containing the RpG substitution) showed better results for the immunomers, suggesting that incorporation of the RpG substitution into the immunomers may overcome species-dependent selectivity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). Treatment of human macrophage-like cell cultures with oligonucleotides 170 or 173, compared with immunomers 175 or 176 further suggests that incorporation of the RpG substitution into immunomers overcomes species-selective activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). Similar results are shown for activation of NF-&#x3ba;B and degradation of I&#x3ba;-B&#x3b1; in J774 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). Immunomer 176 also showed immunostimulatory activity in cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0216" num="0217">pDCs were isolated from human PBMCs using a BDCA-4 cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pDC were plated in 96-well plates using 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL, 200 &#x3bc;L/well). The Immunomers were added to a final concentration of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0 &#x3bc;g/mL to the cell cultures and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 24 hr. Supernatants were then harvested and assayed for IFN-&#x3b1;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x3b1; using ELISA kit (provided by PBL). Tables 24A-24D show an average&#xb1;SD of IFN-&#x3b1;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x3b1; for Donors 1-4 with Immunomers at a concentrations of 10.0 &#x3bc;g/mL.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">SUBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention concerns a biomaterial made of amide derivatives of hyaluronic acid (HA), particularly the hexadecylamide of HA, administered by the intra-articular route as a partial/total substitute for synovial fluid to treat joints affected by osteoarthrosis (OA) as well as cases of joint inflammation and/or trauma that cause damage to the cartilage and/or synovia (associated with pain). Lastly, we describe and claim their use in the treatment of joints where the entire structure shows signs of wear due to physiological aging.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">Osteoarthosis/osteoarthritis (OA) is a seriously disabling condition characterised by a progressive erosion of joint cartilage due to degradation of the joint matrix and loss of the main cell components: chondrocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">The exact etiology of the condition is still unclear. However, recent studies have shown it may be triggered by mechanical imbalance affecting the whole joint. Mechanical joint instability may be caused by various factors (e.g. trauma and/or mechanical stress involving the joint capsule in toto, inflammation of the joint system) and may upset the delicate balance between synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix, which is mainly synthesised by chondrocytes and synoviocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">When this perfect, but fragile, homeostasis is upset, degradation of the matrix is uncompensated by its synthesis because of the loss of chondrocytes, and gradually worsens.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Indeed, excessive and/or incorrect loading of the joint may cause a chondrocyte response that manifests itself in synthesis of the very enzymes responsible for degradation of the cartilage, protease enzymes called metallo-proteinase (MMP). These are synthesised by the chondrocytes when stimulated by inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF-&#x3b1;, that are produced and released in the joint cavity, particularly at the onset of an inflammatory pathology. IL-1 also stimulates synthesis of high levels of nitric oxide (responsible for chondrocyte death by apoptosis) as well as inhibiting proteoglycan synthesis (matrix components) by the chondrocytes themselves (Dozin B. et al., Matrix Biology, 2002, 21:449-459).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">It is known that the extracellular matrix must be integral for chondrocytes to survive. Data in the scientific literature have demonstrated that degradation of molecules from the matrix may lead to the release of other molecules (that likewise derive from degradation of the matrix) similarly capable of inducing chondrocyte apoptosis (Cao L. et al., Exp Cell Res, 1999, 246:527-537).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">For this reason, the cartilage of osteoarthrotic patients presents a decrease in cellularity and corresponding increase in the formation of empty &#x201c;lacunae&#x201d; within the joint matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">High levels of IL-1 have been found in the synovial fluid of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (Arend W. P. et al., Arthritis Rheum, 1995, 38:151-160).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">The physiological aging process of the joint surfaces also seems to involve the enzymatic mechanisms peculiar to OA. Consequently, the therapies normally used to treat this pathology are also applied to joints with cartilage partially or totally damaged by &#x201c;normal&#x201d; joint aging.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">The cartilage matrix is constituted by a three-dimensional structure formed by molecules of collagen and aggregated proteoglycan complexes. These in turn are constituted by a supporting structure based on hyaluronic acid that interacts with glycosaminoglycan molecules (GAG), non-covalently bound to polypeptide sequences associated with hyaluronic acid (HA), thus giving the cartilage both mechanical and viscoelastic properties.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">Indeed, HA is a molecule with special viscoelastic properties, synthesised and secreted also in the joint cavity mainly by the synoviocytes (Asari A. et al., Arch Histol Cytol, 1995, 58(1):65-76) and it is therefore one of the main components of synovial fluid. When the joint is moved slowly, HA acts as a viscous lubricant, while when it is moved briskly HA's elastic properties enable it to act as a shock absorber counteracting any trauma or microtrauma to which the joint may be exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">It is known that the functional characteristics of the synovial fluid depend on both the concentration and degree of polymerisation of HA, and that any changes in these may lead to OA-type histological damage to the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">The turnover of HA (and of glycosaminoglycans in general) in healthy synovial fluid is usually rapid (1 day in the sheep), but in the course of OA, a drop in its concentration (associated with a decrease in GAG) and its mean molecular weight (MW) has been observed, as well as a marked decrease in its turnover (Balazs E A. et al., J Rheumatol Suppl, 1993, 12:75-82; Belcher C. et al., Annals of the Rheumathic Disease, 1997, 56:299-307).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">Further findings have shown that HA not only has biomechanical viscosupplementation properties, but also the ability to protect chondrocytes from the action of IL-1, measured as the percentage of proteoglycan synthesis (Brun P. et al., OsteoArthritis and Cartilage, 2003, 11:208-216), (Stove J. et al., Journal of Orthopaedic Research, 2002, 20:551-555).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">Based on these observations, it was Balazs who first suggested that the evolution of osteoarthrosis might be modified by administering exogenous HA, especially high-molecular-weight HA, directly into the joint cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">There are various drugs currently on the market for the intra-articular administration of HA in OA, such as: Hyalgan&#xae;, HA purified from rooster combs with a MW of: 5-7.5&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>Da (European patent No. 0138572 B1); Synvisc&#xae;, (Hylan G-F 20) HA cross-linked with formaldehyde and divinyl sulphone with a MW of: 6-7&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Da (U.S. Pat. No. 4,713,448), Artz&#xae;, HA with MW: 6.2-12&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>Da.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">Moreover, European patent No. 1144459 B1 describes and claims a new HA derivative for the treatment of OA joint pathologies. It is a hyaluronic acid derivative cross-linked with polyamines to form amide bonds with the carboxy groups of HA. It is in the form of a generally water insoluble hydrogel, prepared and subsequently tested with a final degree of cross-linking of 50% (Barbucci R. et al., Biomaterials, 2002, 23:4503-4513).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">Intra-articular injections of HA are known to provide viscosupplementation and improve function in limbs affected by OA pathology, with a consequent reduction in joint pain. However, HA's residence time in the joint capsule is limited to about 40 hours after application of Hyalgan&#xae; (Fraser J R. et al., Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism, 1993, 22:9-17) while in the case of Synvisc&#xae; it may last for a few days (Fiorentini R., Proceedings of the US FDA Advisory Panel on Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices, Nov. 21, 1996 Fairfax (VA):CASET Associates, 1996; Berkowitz D., Proceedings of the US FDA Advisory Panel on Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices, Nov. 20, 1996 Fairfax (VA):CASET Associates, 1996).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">This limitation means that weekly administration cycles are usually called for, with a total of at least 5 intra-articular injections.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0020">Moreover, some of these drugs based on chemically modified HA, such as Synvisc&#xae;, have been involved in reports of sometimes serious adverse events (Hammesfahr J F. et al., The American Journal of Orthopaedics, 2003, 32:277-283), probably following the onset of inflammatory processes, especially linked with eosinophil recruitment (Schiavinato A. et al., Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology, 2002, 20:445-454).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021">Considering the above, new chemical derivatives of HA are being studied that enable the problems linked with both residence time in the joint cavity and the risk of toxicity due to solvents and/or particular chemical agents used in the chemical modification of HA to be overcome, while maintaining all the characteristics and intrinsic properties of the polysaccharide unaltered.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">The Applicant has surprisingly discovered that HA, chemically bound to an amine by its carboxy group and called HYADD&#x2122; (European patent No. 1095064 B1), has all the intrinsic properties of HA described above, demonstrating, moreover, that it provides a surprising proliferative stimulus towards OA human chondrocytes, elicits a protective action on OA synovia, slowing down the degenerative process, reducing the changes in the morphology of OA cartilage surface and the formation of osteophytes (the bony formations typical of osteoarthrosis), thus representing a new curative therapy for OA and, lastly, that it possesses viscoelastic characteristics that allow the partial and/or complete integration/substitution of the synovial fluid in a joint that has been damaged or treated by surgery, enabling correct, painless loading of the knee.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">European patent No. 1095064 B1 describes and claims amide derivatives of HA that originate from the formation of an amide bond between the carboxy group of HA and the amine group of an amine belonging to the aliphatic, aromatic, arylaliphatic, cycloaliphatic, heteroaliphatic series. The compounds that derive therefrom (called HYADD&#x2122;) can present different degrees of amidation, ranging from 0.1 to 5%, (Example 1) so that the final product is soluble in water, phosphate buffer or saline solution.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0036">Said derivatives have been described with regard to the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions formulated in various different ways, in the preparation of biomaterials made into different forms for the preparation of surgical articles and, lastly, in forms suitable for the coating of biomedical objects such as catheters and stents.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0037">Their use has also been claimed in a vast range of clinical practices, including orthopaedics. However, their use has never been described, claimed, or even hypothesised, as a biomaterial to be used specifically at an intra-articular level as a curative therapy for OA, or for RA and psoriatic arthritis, in all cases of inflammation and/or joint trauma causing damage to the cartilage and/or synovia (associated with pain) and lastly, as a therapy for pathologies associated with aging of the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">In particular, it is object of the present invention the use of amide derivatives of hyaluronic acid for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of osteoarthrosis/osteoarthritis.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">Amide derivatives of hyaluronic acid as partial and/or total substitutes for the synovial fluid in the treatment of joints affected by osteoartrosis, trauma, inflammation and/or wear due to aging of the joint structure are also object of the present invention. Biomaterials constituted by the amide derivatives of hyaluronic acid are also object of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0040">By the experiments described hereafter, the Applicant has demonstrated that:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0041">HYADD&#x2122; derivatives possess the intrinsic properties of HA, with a decidedly longer residence time in the joint than that of native HA;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0042">they exercise a strong proliferative stimulus on OA chondrocytes and therefore promise to be an effective new therapy for the cure of damaged cartilage;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0043">they exercise an unexpected protective action on OA synovia and cartilage, slowing down the degenerative process;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0044">they have viscoelastic properties that enable the partial and/or complete integration/substitution of the synovial fluid in a joint which is damaged/inflamed/aged or which has undergone surgery;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0045">they have no toxic effect on chondrocytes or synoviocytes treated in vitro and in vivo;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0046">lastly, for all the above reasons, the HYADD&#x2122; derivatives have proved active in reducing OA-associated pain, thus enabling correct loading of the joint.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">Based on the above, the Applicant claims HYADD&#x2122; derivatives as biomaterials to be used to substitute partially/totally the synovial fluid in the treatment of joints, especially those affected by OA and, moreover, for joints affected by trauma and/or inflammation, or that have been damaged by the physiological aging process or treated by surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">The HA derivatives known as HYADD&#x2122; described in the present invention are synthesised according to European patent No. 1095064 B1, starting with an HA derivative from any source, for example, obtained by extraction from rooster combs (European patent No. 0138572 B1), or by fermentation or by technological means, and have a molecular weight ranging between 400 and 3&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Da, in particular between 1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>Da and 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Da, and even more particularly between 500,000 and 750,000 Da.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">The HYADD&#x2122; derivative used in all the experiments performed, both in vitro and in vivo, has an average degree of amidation of 2-3%, and was synthesised using hexadecylamine with carbonyl diimidazole as the preferred activating agent (Example 2).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">The product obtained is water soluble and can be sterilised by the methods known to experts in the field. However, sterilisation by autoclave is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">In particular, in the amide derivatives of hyaluronic acid according to the present invention the amide is formed by amide bond between the carboxy group of hyaluronic acid and the amine group of an amine belonging to the aliphatic, aromatic, arylaliphatic, cycloaliphatic or heteroaliphatic series. The amine is preferably hexadecylamine. The degree of amidation ranges between 0.1 and 5%. More preferably the mean degree of amidation is 2% or 5%.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">The amide derivatives of hyaluronic acid according to the present invention are made in the form of gels, hydrogels, powders, microspheres, nanospheres.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">The purpose of the experiments described hereafter was to analyse both the viscosity and chemical/biological properties of the HYADD&#x2122; derivative:

</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0061">18 Merino sheep aged 7-8 years first underwent meniscectomy for removal of the lateral part of the meniscus in both front limbs; 16 weeks after surgery, OA was evident, as described in Ghosh P. et al., Proceeding Hyaluronan 2003 Congress, Ed. Matrix Biology Institute 2004 e in Little C. et al., J Rheumatol, 1997, 24:2199-2209.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Treatment</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0062">The 18 animals were then divided into 3 groups, each given a different treatment starting the 16<sup>th </sup>week after surgery and ending in the 20<sup>th </sup>week:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0063">OA+Placebo: the animals were treated weekly with 1 intra-articular injection of 2 ml of sterile saline solution, for a total of 5 injections;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0064">OA+HA: the animals were treated weekly with 1 intra-articular injection of 2 ml of HA (MW 500,000-730,000 D), for a total of 5 injections;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0065">OA+HYADD&#x2122;: these animals were treated every two weeks with 1 intra-articular injection of 2 ml of HYADD&#x2122; (Hexadecylamide of hyaluronic acid with a MW of PM 500,000-730,000 D and a mean degree of amidation of 2%) diluted in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, for a total of 3 injections.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0066">The animals were sacrificed in the 26<sup>th </sup>week.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0067">Synovial fluid was taken from the sheep immediately before the start of treatment and 1 week before sacrifice (hence, 5 weeks after the end of treatment), while the synovia and cartilage were removed at the time of sacrifice.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Analyses Performed In Vivo:</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Histology of the Synovia</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0068">The samples of synovia from the joints subjected to meniscectomy and treated as described above, were first immersed in buffered formalin solution (10% in PBS) for 24-48 hours. After dehydration with alcohol and xylol, they were embedded in paraffin and processed as known to an expert in the field to obtain sections 4 &#x3bc;m thick, subsequently stained with haematoxylin and eosin. To the 3 groups of samples treated as described, a 4th group of non-operated animals was added, representing &#x201c;non-OA controls&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0069">The synovial membrane covers the entire inside non-cartilage surface of the joint cavity and is constituted by connective tissue. Structurally, it is composed of three layers, known as the intima, subintima and subsynovial. In the intima, regularly arranged reticular and collagen fibres can be seen, that increase in number in the subintima and subsynovial. Said sections were analysed under an optical microscope using a grid of 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>which, with a 40&#xd7; magnifying lens, projected a visual field of 250 &#x3bc;m of each area analysed. Five randomly selected areas were analysed per section. The parameters considered (chosen because they characterise OA), were the following: hyperplasia of the intima, presence of plasma infiltrations in the intima and fibrosis of the synovial membrane (manifested by an &#x201c;untidy&#x201d; arrangement of the collagen fibres in the synovia).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0070">Fibrosis of the synovia was assessed by measuring the depth of the subintima up to a maximum value of 250 &#x3bc;m. Scoring in the first two parameters was based on the table below:</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0072">Meniscectomy caused a significant increase in all the histological parameters analysed, compared to the non-operated controls (which represent an OA-free situation), thus demonstrating the validity of the model of OA induction that was used. In all cases, treatment with HYADD&#x2122; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>) determined a marked and significant improvement in the parameters considered, with regard to treatment with both Placebo and HA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and, in one case (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), HYADD&#x2122; even gave the same result as the non-OA control.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0073">In parallel with the histological analysis of the synovial membrane, macroscopic morphological analysis was performed on the joint cartilage of the OA animals compared to the non-treated ones (placebo) and the controls (in this case too, a fourth group of non-operated animals representing &#x201c;non-OA controls&#x201d; was added to the three groups). The joints were opened to analyse the surface of the medial joints connecting the tibia and femur.

<p id="p-0062" num="0076">The animals treated with placebo had the highest scores for osteophyte development (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>). Treatment with HYADD&#xae; significantly reduced the development of such alterations, particularly evident in the medial compartment of the femoral condyle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0077">Similarly, the highest scores relative to cartilage damage were seen in the animals treated with placebo, while the cartilage of the group treated with HYADD&#xae; was the least altered, considering both the tibial plate and the femoral condyle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-7</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Glycosaminoglycan Concentration</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0078">The purpose of this analysis was to assess and compare the concentration of sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) present and/or newly synthesised in the synovial fluid of the treated animals vs placebo. The analysis was performed using the technique described by Farndale R W. et al., Connective Tissue Res., 1982, 9:247-248, and perfected by Appleyard R C. et al., Osteoarthritis Cartilage, 2003, 11:65-77.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0079">The results are shown as a graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> as the concentration of GAGs determined at the end of treatment and expressed as a percentage of the concentration measured at the start of treatment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows that treatment with HYADD&#x2122; alone determines a greater increase than placebo in the concentration of GAGS in the synovial fluid at the end of the experiment (which, conversely, gives substantially lower values than at the start of treatment, as discussed previously), GAGs which might derive from greater synthesis by the synoviocytes of synovial tissue stimulated and protected by the HA amide in question.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Dynamic Viscosity</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0080">The dynamic viscosity of the synovial fluid (i.e. its intrinsic viscosity) was measured at the beginning and 5 weeks after the end of each treatment with a Micro Fourier Rheometer. All the findings were calculated and compared with one another at a frequency of 0.5 Hz (Ghosh P. et al., Proceedings Hyaluronan 2003 Congress, Ed. Matrix Biology Institute 2004).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0081">The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>: HYADD&#x2122; treatment determines a significant increase in intrinsic viscosity in the treated animals, compared to placebo.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Residence Time</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0082">The residence time of HYADD&#x2122; in the joint cavity was assessed in non-OA rabbit joints: 5 groups of 5 rabbits each were given a single intra-articular injection of 0.25 ml of HYADD&#x2122; at an initial concentration of 5 mg/ml (each joint therefore received 1.25 mg of HYADD&#x2122;), and analysed 15, 25, 35, 45 and 55 days after administration.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0083">Residence time in the joint was determined by HPLC analysis of the amine residue (of the HYADD&#x2122; derivative) present in the synovial fluid taken from the treated joints, at the set times, after euthanasia of the animals.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0084">The synovial fluid samples were treated with NaOH before hydrolysis at 70&#xb0; C., thus enabling complete release of the hexadecyl amine from the molecule in question. The amine was then extracted from the solution with diethylether, dissolved in methanol and prepared for chromatographic analysis by the HPLC technique with fluorometer (excitation wavelength 330 nm, emission wavelength 440 nm).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0085">By quantifying the hexadecyl amine in the samples, it is possible to establish the concentration of HYADD&#x2122; in the synovial fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0086">The resulting residence time was 15 days, because 27% of the initial derivative was still present in the joint cavity after this time, but this value had dropped to 5% 25 days after injection, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Determining the Location of Preference of the HYADD&#x2122; Derivative</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0087">For this type of experiment, we used the HYADD&#x2122; derivative labelled with the isotope <sup>14</sup>C: (<sup>14</sup>C)-HYADD&#x2122; with specific initial activity of 3.01 &#x3bc;CI.mg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, prepared and supplied by ABC Laboratories. The derivative (<sup>14</sup>C)-HYADD&#x2122; was prepared in phosphate buffer at an initial concentration of 8 mg.ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>; 0.4 ml of the resulting solution was injected into the joint cavities of 5+5 rabbits which were later sacrificed on the 2<sup>nd </sup>and 14<sup>th </sup>days after treatment when the radioactivity present on the cartilage surface was analysed. The samples of cartilage taken were first exposed to basic hydrolysis with NaOH 2M for 30 minutes at 70&#xb0; C. Each sample was then washed with buffer and the washing buffer pooled with the previous solutions of NaOH. The samples were then mixed with Quickszint 1 scintillation fluid (in a ratio of 1:10) for the final radioactivity reading, then the radioactivity was determined using a Packard TR 2100 scintillation analyser.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0088">The results obtained were expressed as the percentage of initial injected radioactivity. Two days after the intra-articular injections, the % of radioactivity recovered after basic hydrolysis of the cartilage was 2% of that initially injected, while the value dropped to 1% 14 days after treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0089">This result clearly indicates that the HYADD&#x2122; derivative does not remain confined to the synovial fluid after being injected intra-articularly, but can be found on the surface of the joint cartilage as early as two days later, thus confirming that the amide derivative, subject of the present invention, represents a new therapy for the treatment of OA.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0091">They were first chopped in a Petri dish, washed and centrifuged with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at 2000 rpm at 20&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes, then resuspended in PBS containing trypsin (0.2%) and EDTA (0.1%). The digested material was washed and centrifuged with culture medium (DMEM) and then resuspended in DMEM containing foetal calf serum FCS (10%). The cells thus obtained were recentrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes and the pellet was collected with culture medium (DMEM/FCS) containing 2 mg/ml of collagenase. After 3 hours' incubation at 37&#xb0; C., the cells were centrifuged and seeded in Petri dishes with DMEM containing 10% FCS. The cells thus obtained were expanded to the second passage. The medium was renewed every 2/3 days and, when the cells had reached 90% confluence, used to determine HA synthesis, by incubating the synoviocytes with set aliquots of <sup>3</sup>H-acetate (Amersham Pharmacia Boitech). The cells were then treated as described by Ghosh P. et al., Proceedings Hyaluronan 2003 Congress, Ed. Matrix Biology Institute 2004 for the final determination of the <sup>3</sup>H-acetate incorporated in the HA molecules synthesised in vitro by the synoviocytes.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0092">The results obtained show that treating OA joints with HYADD&#x2122; protects the synoviocytes from the cytotoxic action of the proinflammatory cytokines normally present in OA joints, favouring/maintaining unaltered their cell metabolism, demonstrated by their high capacity for HA synthesis, as shown by the experimental data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, obtained with synoviocytes taken from OA sheep treated HYADD&#x2122; vs placebo.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0094">Human chondrocytes: the cells were obtained by biopsy from joint cartilage from patients who had undergone surgery for joint replacements. In short, the samples were minced and treated with trypsin (0.25%), testicular hyaluronidase and type I collagenase. The digested material was then resuspended in culture medium (Ham's F12) containing foetal calf serum (10%), glutamine, 4 mM, and penicillin/streptomycin, 100 U.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0095">The cells thus obtained were expanded to the second passage with daily changes of medium. Cell viability was tested by staining with Trypan Blue.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0096">To check for any toxicity and/or any possible influence that HYADD&#x2122; may have on the chondrocyte proliferation rate, the cells were seeded in the presence of two different concentrations of HYADD&#x2122; (0.5 and 1.5 mg/ml of culture medium) for a period of 3 to 9 days. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell viability was determined by the MTT method (Dezinot F. et al., J Immunol Methods, 1986, 22(89):271-277).</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Results</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0097">The results obtained (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) indicate that treatment with HYADD&#x2122; at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml significantly increased the viability of human chondrocytes in all the test preparations as early as the 3<sup>rd </sup>day of treatment. Moreover, after 9 days of treatment, a significant proliferative effect of the amide derivative could be seen, both for the concentration of 1.5 mg/ml and for the lower one of 0.5 mg/ml.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0098">The results of the study with HYADD&#x2122; therefore confirm that said hyaluronic acid derivative has a marked proliferative effect on cultures of human chondrocytes from OA patients.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0111">Two grams (3.2 mM) of tetrabutylammonium salt of HA (HA/TBA) is solubilised in 100 ml of DMSO. The solution is insufflated with HCL vapours or treated with 60 &#x3bc;l of methane sulphonic acid till it reaches a pH value of between 4.5 and 5. Subsequently, 52 grams (0.32 mM) of carbonyl diimidazole was added to the solution, which is shaken at room temperature for 1 hour, then 780 mg (3.2 mM) of hexadecylamine is added. It is left to react for 16-18 hours, after which 5 ml of a saturated NaCl solution is added and the product obtained is precipitated with 200 ml of acetone, filtered and vacuum-dried.

<p id="p-0007" num="0016">In addition, it is known that a primary allylic amine is produced from an allylic amide which is produced by reacting an allylic carbonate with an amide as a nucleophilic reagent in the presence of a phosphoramidite ligand and an iridium complex (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 5546-5549). Moreover, it is known that a secondary or tertiary allylic amine is produced from an allylic alcohol using a primary or secondary amine as a nucleophilic reagent in the presence of a phosphoramidite ligand and an iridium complex (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 7508-7509).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0017">Since all of the above-mentioned methods use a primary or secondary amine as a nucleophilic reagent, the obtained compound is a secondary or tertiary allylic amine, which is unsuitable for the production of a primary allylic amine. Moreover, since the first and the second methods involve production from an allylic carbonate, which is an activated allylic alcohol, the methods require a step for producing an allylic carbonate from an allylic alcohol. The third method requires a Lewis acid and molecular sieves (registered trade mark) as activators for an allylic alcohol in a reaction system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0018">The present invention provides a method capable of direct production of a primary allylic amine from an allylic alcohol, without use of an activator for an allylic alcohol or conversion of an allylic alcohol into an activated compound thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0019">The present inventors have conducted intensive studies in an attempt to solve the aforementioned problems and found that a primary allylic amine can be produced directly from an allylic alcohol, without conventional use of an activator for an allylic alcohol or conversion of an allylic alcohol into an activated compound thereof, by reacting an allylic alcohol with sulfamic acid in the presence of a catalyst prepared from a phosphoramidite ligand represented by the following formula (I) and an iridium complex (catalyst precursor), which resulted in the completion of the present invention. Of the phosphoramidite ligands represented by the following formula (I), a phosphoramidite ligand represented by the following formula (Ia) is a novel compound.</p>

N,N-Dimethylformamide (2 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at 23&#xb0; C. for 15 min. Racemic 1-cyclohexylprop-2-en-1-ol (70 mg, 0.50 mmol, 1 eq.) was added via syringe followed by the addition of solid sulfamic acid (49 mg, 0.50 mmol, 1 eq.). The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 23&#xb0; C. for 24 hr. After completion of the reaction, as determined by TLC, the solvent was carefully evaporated at high vacuum. The resulting brown residue was dissolved in methylene chloride (10 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution (10 mL), and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. The aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride (3&#xd7;15 mL). The combined organic layers were dried (sodium sulfate) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The ratio of regioisomers was determined by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR analysis of the unpurified sample. Purification of the residue by flash chromatography on neutral alumina using methylene chloride/methanol as an eluent afforded the desired amine which was immediately treated with 2M hydrochloric acid in diethyl ether. The corresponding hydrochloride salt (the title compound, 61 mg, 0.35 mmol, yield 70%) precipitated as a white solid.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0163">To determine the absolute configuration, the obtained amine hydrochloride (50 mg, 0.28 mmol, 1 eq.) was suspended in diethyl ether (1 mL) and treated with 6 M potassium hydroxide (0.5 mL, 10 eq.). After stirring at 23&#xb0; C. for 30 min, the mixture was partitioned between diethyl ether and water. The aqueous phase was extracted three times with diethyl ether. The combined organic layers were washed with brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. The mixture was carefully concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a brownish oil that was immediately dissolved in methylene chloride (2 mL) and treated with triethylamine (115 mg, 1.14 mmol, 4 eq.) and freshly distilled trichloroacetyl chloride (103 mg, 0.57 mmol, 2 eq.). After 3 hr stirring at 23&#xb0; C., the reaction mixture was partitioned between methylene chloride and water. The aqueous phase was extracted three times with methylene chloride. The combined organic layers were washed with brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. Concentration of the mixture under reduced pressure yielded in a brownish residue that was subjected to chromatography on silica gel (30:1 hexanes/ethyl acetate) to give 2,2,2-trichloro-N-(1-cyclohexylallyl)acetamide (36 mg, 0.13 mmol, 45%) as a colorless solid.

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2007-0108686, filed on Oct. 29, 2007, which is incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a light emitting diode (LED), particularly a GaN-based LED, and more particularly, to an LED having enhanced current spreading and light extraction efficiencies by incorporating a layer between a semiconductor layer and an electrode pad.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An LED is a photoelectric conversion device that emits light through recombination of electrons and holes when current is applied. As an example, a GaN-based LED has an n-type semiconductor layer, an active layer, and a p-type semiconductor layer, which are sequentially arranged on a substrate. A transparent electrode layer is arranged on the p-type semiconductor layer, and a p-type electrode pad is arranged on the transparent electrode. The active layer and the p-type semiconductor layer may be partially removed so that a portion of the n-type semiconductor layer is exposed. An n-type electrode pad is arranged on an upper region of the exposed n-type semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such an LED, light is mainly emitted through a portion of the transparent electrode layer, which serves as an electrode together with the electrode pad. Therefore, when selecting a material for the transparent electrode layer, it should have strong electrical characteristics and should minimally interrupt light emission. A Ni/Au layer or an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer may be used as the transparent electrode layer. The Ni/Au layer has an excellent electrical characteristic but has a low transparency with respect to visible light. Conversely, the ITO layer has a transmittance of 90% or more with respect to visible light and thus is excellent in transparency, but has a low electrical characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a conventional LED, an opening may be formed by etching a portion of a transparent electrode layer (particularly, an ITO layer), and a p-type electrode pad contacts the p-type semiconductor layer through the opening. In the conventional LED, a p-type tunnel layer (p++) doped with a highly concentrated p-type impurity is arranged on the p-type semiconductor layer for establishing an ohmic contact. Therefore, the p-type electrode pad contacts the p-type tunnel layer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the conventional LED, current flow is concentrated just under the p-type electrode pad, and therefore, current may not be widely spread out on the transparent electrode layer. This is because the p-type electrode pad is in direct contact with the p-type tunnel layer. The structure causes the recombination rate of electrons and holes in an active layer to decrease, thereby lowering luminous efficiency. Also, in the conventional LED, a large amount of light may be absorbed by the p-type electrode pad, and therefore lost.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This invention provides an LED having a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) formed under a p-type electrode pad to reduce light absorption and light loss and to spread light to surroundings of the DBR.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention discloses an LED having an n-type semiconductor layer, an active layer, a p-type semiconductor layer, and a transparent electrode layer. The LED includes a tunnel layer interposed between the p-type semiconductor layer and the transparent electrode layer, an opening arranged in the transparent electrode layer so that the tunnel layer or the p-type semiconductor layer arranged under the tunnel layer is exposed upward, a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) arranged in the opening; and an electrode pad arranged on the transparent electrode layer to cover the DBR in the opening. The LED may be a GaN-based LED.</p>

In addition, portions of the active layer <b>240</b> and the p-type electrode layer <b>260</b> may be removed so that a portion of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>220</b> is exposed upward. A p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> may be arranged on an upper surface of the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b>, and an n-type electrode pad <b>440</b> may be arranged on an upper surface of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The substrate <b>100</b> may be a sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) substrate or a SiC substrate having a thermal conductivity higher than that of a sapphire substrate. A buffer layer <b>210</b> for reducing lattice mismatch between the substrate <b>100</b> and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>220</b> may be arranged on the substrate <b>100</b>. The semiconductor layers arranged on the substrate <b>100</b> may be formed of a GaN-based semiconductor. The buffer layer <b>210</b> may be formed of AlN or GaN.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The active layer <b>240</b> is partially arranged on a region of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>220</b>, and the p-type semiconductor <b>260</b> is arranged on the active layer <b>240</b>. Therefore, a region of the upper surface of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>220</b> contacts the active layer <b>240</b>, and another region of the upper surface of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>220</b> is exposed upward by the partial removal of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>260</b> and the active layer <b>240</b>. An indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent electrode layer having excellent transmittance of visible light is used as the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b> and arranged on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The n-type semiconductor layer <b>220</b> may be formed of n-type Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>1-x-y</sub>N (0&#x2266;x, y, x+y&#x2266;1) and may include an n-type clad layer.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The active layer <b>240</b> is a region in which electrons and holes are recombined and may include InGaN. The wavelength of extracted light depends upon the material of the active layer <b>240</b>. The active layer <b>240</b> may be a multi-layered film having quantum well layers and barrier layers repeatedly formed. The barrier well layer and quantum well layer may be binary or quaternary compound semiconductor layers represented by a general formula of Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>1-x-y</sub>N (0&#x2266;x, y, x+y&#x2266;1).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a tunnel layer <b>310</b> is arranged between the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>260</b>. The tunnel layer <b>310</b> allows an ohmic contact to form between the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>260</b>.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, an opening <b>342</b> that exposes a portion of the tunnel layer <b>310</b> upward is arranged in the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b>. The opening <b>342</b> may be formed by etching a portion of the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b>. A portion of the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b> that is not to be etched is covered with a mask material such as photoresist (PR), and then an etching process is performed to remove the portion of the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b> corresponding to the opening <b>342</b>. The etching process may be a wet or dry etching process. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a portion of the tunnel layer <b>310</b> is exposed by the opening <b>342</b>. However, since the opening <b>342</b> is formed through the etching process, the p-type semiconductor layer <b>260</b> under the tunnel layer <b>310</b> may be exposed upward by the opening <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A DRB <b>330</b> may be arranged to a predetermined height in the opening <b>342</b>. The DBR <b>330</b> may be formed by filling the opening <b>342</b> so that the DBR <b>330</b> has the predetermined height measured from an upper surface of the tunnel layer <b>310</b>. A lower surface of the DBR <b>330</b> may contact the upper surface of the tunnel layer <b>310</b>, and an upper surface of the DBR <b>330</b> may contact the p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> arranged on the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b>. The p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> may be formed of a metallic material, such as Ni, Cr, Pt, Au, Ag, Ti or W, or a carbon nano tube.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A lower surface of the p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> may contact the upper surface of the DBR <b>330</b> in the opening <b>342</b>, and a side surface of the p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> may contact the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b> in the opening <b>342</b>. Furthermore, the p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> may contact the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b> outside of the opening <b>342</b>, such as along an upper surface of the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The DBR <b>330</b> blocks current from directly flowing from the p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> to the tunnel layer <b>310</b>, so that the current can be more widely spread in the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b>. Further, the DBR <b>330</b> structure has a light reflectance much greater than that of a metal of the p-type electrode pad <b>340</b>, thereby reducing light absorption by the p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> and light loss. An LED provided with a current spreading function under the p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> has been disclosed in Korean Patent No. 10-0721515, which is registered in the name of the applicant and incorporated herein by reference as a part of this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Where &#x3bb; is a wavelength of light, n is a refractive index of a medium, and m is an odd number, the DBR <b>330</b> may have a structure in which semiconductor layers are alternately laminated to a thickness of m&#x3bb;/4n to obtain a reflectance of 95% or more in light having a specific wavelength (&#x3bb;). The DBR <b>330</b> has bandgap energy greater than an oscillation wavelength, and therefore, light is not well absorbed thereto. The refractive index between the layers (i.e., media) of the DBR <b>330</b> is increased, whereby the reflectance can be more increased.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the DBR <b>330</b> has a structure in which low refractive index layers <b>330</b><i>a </i>and high refractive index layers <b>330</b><i>b </i>are repeatedly laminated. The low refractive index layers <b>330</b><i>a </i>and high refractive index layers <b>330</b><i>b </i>have a &#x3bb;/4 thickness of a reference wavelength. Although a variety of materials may be considered as the materials of the low refractive index layers <b>330</b><i>a </i>and the high refractive index layers <b>330</b><i>b</i>, SiO<sub>2 </sub>having a refractive index of 1.4 or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>having a refractive index of 1.6 may be used as the low refractive index layer <b>330</b><i>a</i>, while Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>or TiO<sub>2 </sub>having a refractive index of over 2 or Si&#x2014;H having a refractive index of over 3 may be used as the high refractive index layer <b>330</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view of an LED according to another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an LED <b>1</b> of this embodiment includes a DBR <b>330</b> (hereinafter, referred to as an &#x201c;upper DBR&#x201d;) arranged in an opening <b>342</b> between a p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> and a tunnel layer <b>310</b>, and further includes a DBR <b>230</b> (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;lower DBR&#x201d;) arranged under an active layer <b>240</b>. The configuration of the lower DBR <b>230</b> is the same as or substantially similar to that of the upper DBR <b>330</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Therefore, detailed description of the configuration will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the LED <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, light generated from the active layer <b>240</b>, which is designated by arrow A, and light reflected by the upper DBR <b>330</b>, which is designated by arrow B, are reflected upward by the lower DBR <b>230</b>. Thus, light extraction efficiency of the LED is enhanced by a high reflectance of the lower DBR <b>230</b>. Further, a moving distance of light can be shortened in the LED as compared with the conventional LED in which light is reflected by a reflective material arranged under a substrate. Accordingly, light extraction efficiency of the LED can also be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view of an LED <b>1</b> according to other embodiment of the present invention. In the LED <b>1</b> of this embodiment, an opening <b>342</b> is arranged in the transparent electrode layer <b>320</b>, and a p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> is arranged in the opening <b>342</b>, wherein a lower surface of the p-type electrode pad <b>340</b> contacts a layer <b>330</b>&#x2032;, which is arranged on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>260</b> and is in ohmic contact with the electrode pad <b>340</b>. The layer <b>330</b>&#x2032; may be an n++ layer doped with a high concentrated n-type impurity or an undoped InGaN. Thus, the DBR <b>330</b> positioned in the opening <b>342</b> as described in the previous embodiments may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a DBR reflects light advancing toward an electrode pad with high reflection efficiency, whereby light loss caused by light absorption by the electrode pad can be reduced. Therefore, light extraction efficiency can be enhanced. Further, the exemplary embodiments of the present invention prevent current from directly flowing from the electrode pad to a p-type semiconductor layer or a tunnel layer arranged thereon, thereby enhancing current spreading efficiency in a transparent electrode layer, and therefore, luminous efficiency of an LED.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to solid-state imaging devices, and particularly to a solid-state imaging device including a substrate contact and to a camera including the solid-state imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(2) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Charge Coupled Device (CCD) solid-state imaging devices and Metal Oxide Silicon (MOS) solid-state imaging devices are widely available as imaging devices for a digital still camera, a digital movie camera, and the like. Among such devices, each of the MOS solid-state imaging devices includes, on a single semiconductor substrate, an imaging region made up of imaging pixels and a peripheral circuit region that obtains a signal from each of the imaging pixels included in this imaging region.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Here, a conventional solid-state imaging device is to be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an entire structure of the solid-state imaging device having the conventional substrate contact which is described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001-230400. This solid-state imaging device has a p-type common well formed on an n-type semiconductor substrate, and on this common well, a pixel array area PXA including pixels PXL that are two-dimensionally arranged and a peripheral portion PP in which a circuit for driving and the like is arranged are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Each of the pixels PXL includes, on the semiconductor substrate, a photodiode <b>1</b>, a p+ type semiconductor region <b>2</b>, a transistor, and the like, and further, a substrate contact <b>3</b>. The peripheral portion PP includes a p+ type semiconductor region <b>2</b>&#x2032; and a substrate contact <b>3</b>&#x2032;. The substrate contacts <b>3</b> and <b>3</b>&#x2032; are electrically connected to the p+ semiconductor regions <b>2</b> and <b>2</b>&#x2032;, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, the reason why the substrate contact <b>3</b> is formed is to be described. Under transistors within a pixel PXL, the aforementioned p-type common well is formed so as to control a threshold of the transistors, and is connected to a base voltage (normally, 0V) so as to keep the voltage constant. However, in order to read an output signal from each of the pixels PXL, when turning amplifying transistors on and off in order, a potential of the common well varies with the capacitive coupling of the common well and a gate electrode of a selected transistor. Then, it takes finite lengths of time to reset the varying potential of the common well to the base potential. In the case where the substrate contact <b>3</b> is not formed within the pixel array area, since it is necessary to wait until the potential of the common well is reset to the base potential (0V) for operating the next-selected transistor, it becomes difficult to perform a high speed operation. In order to prevent such situation, conventionally, the substrate contact <b>3</b> is formed within the pixel array, and is connected to a wiring that connects to the base voltage. With this, it becomes possible to substantially reduce the time until the varying potential of the p-type common well is reset to the base potential.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, there is a problem that a sensitivity difference among photodiodes each located in a different position occurs due to the pixel structure of the solid-state imaging device having the aforementioned substrate contact <b>3</b> within the pixel array area.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3A</figref> to <b>3</b>C, the problem is to be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of a solid-state imaging device in which the sensitivity difference occurs among adjacent photodiodes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The diagram illustrates an example of a case where a solid-state imaging device is composed of four pixels in one cell, in other words, a pair of an amplifying transistor and a reset transistor is arranged per four photodiodes <b>1</b>. Furthermore, the diagram illustrates a part of the structure of the solid-state imaging device including: a photodiode <b>1</b>; a gate <b>11</b> of an amplifying transistor; a source region <b>5</b> of the amplifying transistor; a gate <b>10</b> of a reset transistor; a source region <b>7</b> of the reset transistor; a drain region <b>6</b> common to the amplifying transistor and the reset transistor; a power voltage contact <b>17</b> which is connected to a power voltage wiring <b>12</b> and the drain region <b>6</b> and which supplies a power voltage to the pair of the amplifying transistor and the reset transistor; a gate <b>8</b> of a transfer transistor; a detection capacitance unit (floating diffusion layer) <b>9</b>; a p+ type region <b>2</b>; and a substrate contact <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is a problem that the sensitivity difference occurs between the photodiode <b>1</b> that is the second (or third) one from the top and the photodiode <b>1</b> that is the fourth (or fifth) one from the top in the diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This problem is described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate cross-sectional views of the photodiode <b>1</b> when an amplifying transistor or a reset transistor is adjacent to both sides of the photodiode <b>1</b>. Although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the power voltage contact <b>17</b> and the substrate contact <b>3</b> are not arranged on the same section including the photodiode <b>1</b>, they are arranged on the same section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3C</figref> for the convenience of the description.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a collecting lens is placed above the photodiode <b>1</b>. Then, incident light is collected onto the photodiode <b>1</b> through the collecting lens.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, there are cases where incident light enters an element isolation unit <b>18</b> or the n+ type source region <b>7</b> (or <b>5</b>), but does not enter the photodiode. When incident light enters the element isolation unit <b>18</b> or an n+ type source region, electrons are generated with a photoelectric conversion effect. A power voltage (normally, approximately 2 to 5 positive voltages) is applied to the n+ type source region <b>7</b> (or <b>5</b>) for driving a transistor, and the generated electrons move to the power voltage side. For this reason, the electrons do not move to the photodiode side. In this case, the sensitivity of an adjacent photodiode <b>1</b> is not degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, when the photodiode <b>1</b> is adjacent to the p+ type regions <b>2</b> and incident light enters the element isolation unit <b>18</b> or the p+ type region <b>2</b>, similarly, electrons are generated. The substrate contact <b>3</b> is formed on the p+ type region <b>2</b>, and normally, the voltage is maintained at 0 voltage. Thus, the generated electrons move mainly to the photodiode <b>1</b>, but not to the substrate contact <b>3</b>. In this case, the sensitivity of the adjacent photodiode <b>1</b> is degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, in the conventional solid-state imaging device, a sensitivity difference (1 to 5%) occurs between a photodiode adjacent to an n-type region and a photodiode adjacent to a p-type region. In other words, sensitivity properties of photodiodes become different depending on a conductivity type in a semiconductor region adjacent to the photodiode. Accordingly, there is a problem that sensitivity inconsistency in an imaging area occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention has been conceived in view of the aforementioned problem, and the object is to provide the solid-state imaging device that includes a substrate contact and that reduces the sensitivity inconsistency between photodiodes and the sensitivity inconsistency in an imaging area.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to solve the aforementioned problem, the solid-state imaging device according to the present invention is a solid-state imaging device including unit pixels arranged in rows and columns on a semiconductor substrate, wherein the unit pixels include two kinds of unit pixels including a first unit pixel and a second unit pixel that are formed on a common well on the semiconductor substrate, the first unit pixel includes: at least one photoelectric conversion region which converts light into a signal charge; a first semiconductor region which is formed on the common well and which has a conductivity type identical to a conductivity type of the common well; and a first contact electrically connected to the first semiconductor region, and the second unit pixel includes: at least one photoelectric conversion region which converts light into a signal charge; a second semiconductor region which is formed on the common well and which has a conductivity type opposite to the conductivity type of the common well; and a second contact electrically connected to the second semiconductor region.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With this, it is possible to arrange the first semiconductor region in one of sides of the photoelectric conversion region and the second semiconductor region in the other side of the photoelectric conversion region by arranging the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel adjacently each other. In other words, the semiconductor regions each having a different conductivity type are arranged in both sides of the photoelectric conversion region. In this case, the number of electrons entering from the adjacent semiconductor region to the photoelectric conversion region becomes the half of the number of electrons entering thereto in the case where the n-type semiconductor regions are arranged in both sides of the photoelectric conversion region. With this, it becomes possible to reduce a sensitivity difference occurring depending on the placement of the photoelectric conversion region.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Here, the first contact may be connected to a wiring having a base voltage of the common well, and the second contact may be connected to a wiring having a positive voltage that is different from the base voltage. With this structure, it becomes further possible to reduce the time to recover from the variation of the common well with a combination of a voltage in the first contact and a voltage in the second contact.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel may be cyclically or randomly arranged. Here, the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel may be cyclically arranged in one of a column direction and a row direction. Here, the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel may be cyclically arranged in a column direction and in a row direction. With this structure, it becomes possible to reduce a sensitivity difference in the photoelectric conversion region and to reduce the sensitivity inconsistency occurring depending on the placement of the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Here, the first semiconductor region may be a region in which p-type impurities are implanted, and the second semiconductor region may be a region in which n-type impurities are implanted. With this structure, it becomes possible to prevent both sides of the photoelectric conversion region from contacting the p+ type region and to reduce a sensitivity difference occurring depending on the placement of the photoelectric conversion region.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Here, at least one of the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel may further include an amplifying transistor that amplifies the signal charge and a reset transistor that resets the signal charge, the signal charge being converted by the photoelectric conversion region. Furthermore, the first unit pixel further may include at least one dummy wiring, the at least one dummy wiring may have a shape identical to one of a gate electrode of the amplifying transistor and a gate electrode of the reset transistor within the first unit pixel, and a relative position of the dummy wiring and the photoelectric conversion region within the first unit pixel may be identical to a relative position of one of the gate electrode of the amplifying transistor and the gate electrode of the reset transistor and the photoelectric conversion region within the first unit pixel. With this structure including a dummy wiring, it becomes possible to reduce variations of a reflection and a scattering of incident light to the photoelectric conversion region within the first unit pixel which are caused by the difference in the placement of a gate electrode and by the presence or absence of the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Here, the second unit pixel further may include at least one dummy wiring, the at least one dummy wiring may have a shape identical to one of a gate electrode of the amplifying transistor and a gate electrode of the reset transistor within the second unit pixel, and a relative position of the dummy wiring and the photoelectric conversion region within the first unit pixel may be identical to a relative position of one of the gate electrode of the amplifying transistor and the gate electrode of the reset transistor and the photoelectric conversion region within the first unit pixel. With this structure including a dummy wiring, it becomes possible to reduce variations of a reflection and a scattering of incident light to the photoelectric conversion region within the second unit pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Here, the first unit pixel may further include two dummy wirings, each of the two dummy wirings may have a shape identical to a gate electrode of the amplifying transistor and a gate electrode of the reset transistor within the first unit pixel, a relative position of the two dummy wirings and the photoelectric conversion region within the first unit pixel may be identical to a relative position of the gate electrode of the amplifying transistor, the gate electrode of the reset transistor, and the photoelectric conversion region within the first unit pixel, the first semiconductor region may be arranged between the two dummy wirings, and the first unit pixel further may include: a first region which is adjacent to one of the two dummy wirings and is formed on the common well; a second region which is adjacent to the other one of the dummy wirings and is formed on the common well; a third contact electrically connected to the first region; and a fourth contact electrically connected to the second region. Furthermore, the first region and the second region may have a conductivity type opposite to the conductivity type of the first semiconductor region, and the third contact and the fourth contact may be electrically connected to the second contact. With this structure, it becomes possible to absorb the electrons generated in the p-type region (the first semiconductor region) connected to the first contact, in the third region connected to the third contact and in the fourth region connected to the fourth contact. With this, it becomes further possible to reduce the sensitivity difference between the photoelectric conversion regions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Here, the first region and the second region may have a conductivity type identical to the conductivity type of the first semiconductor region, and the third contact and the fourth contact may be electrically connected to the first contact. Since an area occupancy percentage in which the first semiconductor region connected to the first, third, and fourth contacts, and the first region, and the second region occupy the first pixel unit can be minimal with this structure, it becomes possible to reduce the sensitivity difference between the pixels. Furthermore, since the third contact and the fourth contact substantially serve as the first contact, it becomes further possible to reduce the time to recover from the variation of the common well.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Here, the second unit pixel further may include two dummy wirings, each of the two dummy wirings may have a shape identical to a gate electrode of the amplifying transistor and a gate electrode of the reset transistor within the second unit pixel, a relative position of the two dummy wirings and the photoelectric conversion region within the second unit pixel may be identical to a relative position of one of the gate electrode of the amplifying transistor and the gate electrode of the reset transistor and the photoelectric conversion region within the second unit pixel, the second semiconductor region may be arranged between the two dummy wirings, the second unit pixel further may include: a first region which is adjacent to one of the two dummy wirings and is formed on the common well; a second region which is adjacent to the other one of the dummy wirings and is formed on the common well; a third contact electrically connected to the first region; and a fourth contact electrically connected to the second region, the first region and the second region may have a conductive type identical to the conductivity type of the first semiconductor region, and the third contact and the fourth contact may be electrically connected to the first contact. With this structure, it becomes possible to absorb the electrons generated in the p-type region connected to the first contact (the first semiconductor region), in the third region connected to the third contact and in the fourth region connected to the fourth contact. With this, it becomes further possible to reduce the sensitivity difference between the photoelectric conversion regions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, the solid-state imaging device according to the present invention may further include metal wiring layers, wherein at least one of the metal wiring layers includes a metal wiring arranged in an identical structure with respect to each of adjacent photoelectric conversion regions. Since with this structure, at least one of the metal wiring layers is arranged in an identical structure with respect to each of the photoelectric conversion regions, in addition to the aforementioned advantage, a reflection and a scattering of incident light to the photoelectric conversion regions which are caused by the metal wiring can be uniform without having the variations with respect to any of the photoelectric conversion regions. As a result, it becomes possible to reduce variations in sensitivity with respect to each of the photoelectric conversion regions.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Here, the metal wiring included in at least one of the metal wiring layers may include a metal wiring for supplying a power voltage and a metal wiring for reading a signal charge.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Here, at least one of the metal wiring layers may be a second layer or a layer higher than the second layer from a semiconductor substrate side. Since the metal wiring in the second layer or in one of the aforementioned layers easily causes a reflection and a scattering of incident light to the photoelectric conversion region rather than a metal wiring in other layers, this structure produces considerable advantage of making the reflection and scattering of incident light uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, the solid-state imaging device according to the present invention includes unit pixels arranged in rows and columns on a semiconductor substrate, wherein the unit pixels may be formed on a common well on the semiconductor substrate, each of the unit pixels may include: two or more photoelectric conversion regions each for converting light into a signal charge; an amplifying transistor that amplifies the signal charge and a reset transistor that resets the signal charge, the signal charge being converted by each of the photoelectric conversion regions; a power voltage contact which is electrically connected to a drain region of the amplifying transistor and of the reset transistor and which supplies a power voltage to the amplifying transistor and the reset transistor; a first semiconductor region which has a conductivity type identical to a conductivity type of the common well; and a first contact electrically connected to the first semiconductor region, and wherein at least one of metal wiring layers formed close to and above the drain region and the first semiconductor region may be arranged in an identical structure with respect to each of adjacent photoelectric conversion regions. Since with this structure, at least one of the metal wiring layers is arranged in an identical structure with respect to each of the photoelectric conversion regions in addition to the aforementioned advantage, a reflection and a scattering of incident light to the photoelectric conversion regions which are caused by the metal wiring can be uniform without having the variations with respect to any of the photoelectric conversion regions. As a result, it becomes possible to reduce variations in sensitivity with respect to each of the photoelectric conversion regions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Here, the number of the metal wiring layers may be three or four, and a wiring included in one of the metal wiring layers may be a metal wiring in a second layer from a surface of the semiconductor substrate to an upward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Here, an opening width of an opening provided above the photoelectric conversion region including a metal wiring of the at least one of metal wiring layers that is arranged in the identical structure is a smallest opening width, among opening widths of openings included in different metal wiring layers. Since the metal wiring in the second layer or in one of the aforementioned layers easily causes a reflection and a scattering of incident light to the photoelectric conversion region rather a metal wiring in other layers, this structure produces considerable advantage of making the reflection and scattering of incident light uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, since the camera of the present invention includes the aforementioned solid-state imaging device, the similar advantage can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the solid-state imaging device of the present invention, it becomes possible to prevent the sensitivity from being lowered depending on the placement of the photoelectric conversion region. With this, it becomes possible to reduce a sensitivity difference between the photoelectric conversion regions.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The solid-state imaging device in the first embodiment is formed above a common well on a semiconductor substrate and has unit pixels that are two-dimensionally arranged. The unit pixels include two types of unit pixels including the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The first unit pixel includes: at least one photoelectric conversion region which converts light into a signal charge; the first semiconductor region that is formed on a common well and has a conductivity type (p+ type herein) identical to that of the common well; and the first contact electrically connected to the first semiconductor region. The first contact is similar to a conventional substrate contact, and is connected to a base voltage (normally 0V).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Furthermore, the second unit pixel includes: at least one photoelectric conversion region which converts light into a signal charge; the second semiconductor region that is formed on a common well and has a conductivity type (n+ type) opposite to that of the common well; and the second contact electrically connected to the second semiconductor region. The second contact is different from a conventional substrate contact, and is connected to a positive voltage, such as a power voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As such, by providing both the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel, it is possible to arrange the first semiconductor region in one of sides of the photoelectric conversion region and the second semiconductor region in the other side of the photoelectric conversion region. In other words, in many cases, the semiconductor regions each having the opposite conductivity type are arranged in both sides of the photoelectric conversion region. When the semiconductor regions each having the opposite conductivity type are arranged in both sides of the photoelectric conversion region, the number of electrons entering from the adjacent semiconductor region to the photoelectric conversion region becomes a half of that of the number of electrons entering thereto in the case where the n-type semiconductor regions are arranged in the both sides of the photoelectric conversion region. With this, it becomes possible to reduce a sensitivity difference occurring depending on the placement of the photoelectric conversion region.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With reference to the diagrams, the solid-state imaging device according to the first embodiment of the present invention is to be described.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a structure of main units in the solid-state imaging device according to the first embodiment of the present invention. This solid-state imaging device has a pixels-in-one-cell structure that is a structure made up of pixels in a single cell (a four-pixel-in-one-cell structure is applied herein as an example). In other words, the diagram illustrates a case where a pair of an amplifying transistor and a reset transistor is arranged per four photodiodes <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The diagram illustrates, as the structure of the pixel array unit of the solid-state imaging device, a photodiode (photoelectric conversion region) <b>1</b>, a gate <b>11</b> of the amplifying transistor (referred to as amplifying gate), a source region <b>5</b> of the amplifying transistor, a gate <b>10</b> of the reset transistor (referred to as reset gate), a source region <b>7</b> of the reset transistor, a drain region <b>6</b> common to the amplifying transistor and the reset transistor, a power voltage contact <b>17</b>, a gate <b>8</b> of the transfer transistor (referred to as transfer gate), a detecting capacitor unit (floating diffusion layer) <b>9</b>, a p+ type region (the first semiconductor region) <b>2</b>, a substrate contact (the first contact) <b>3</b>, an n+ type region (the second semiconductor region) <b>20</b>, and a power voltage contact (the second contact) <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">One cell having a four-pixel-in-one-cell structure corresponds to, for example, the four photodiodes <b>1</b> that are located in the second row and the first column, in the first row and the second column, in the second row and the third column, and in the first row and the fourth column.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The aforementioned one cell includes: the photodiodes <b>1</b> that are formed on a semiconductor substrate; the transfer gates <b>8</b> that are arranged in a manner that diagonally crosses a part of the respective photodiodes <b>1</b>; and the detecting capacitor unit (floating diffusion layer) <b>9</b> that accumulates a signal charge transferred from each of the transfer gates <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The power voltage contact <b>17</b> is connected to the power voltage wiring <b>12</b>, and supplies a power voltage from the drain region <b>6</b> to the pair of the amplifying transistor and the reset transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">There are cases where the transfer gate <b>8</b> is extended as a wiring for electronically connecting pixels that are adjacent to each other and cases where the transfer gate <b>8</b> is connected using a contact and a metal wiring that is set above the transfer gate. Note using the metal wiring can lower the resistance in the wiring, so that the solid-state imaging device can further accelerate the operation (high-speed driving).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, the substrate contact (the first contact) <b>3</b> is formed on the p+ type region (the first semiconductor region) <b>2</b> in which the same type of impurities as used in the p-type common well are implanted.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">On the other hand, impurities having the conductivity type opposite to the p-type common well are implanted in the n+ type region (the second semiconductor region) <b>20</b>. Furthermore, the power voltage contact <b>30</b> is formed on the n+ type region. In the four-pixel-in-one-cell structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the single substrate contact <b>3</b> and the single power voltage contact <b>30</b> are respectively arranged per eight photodiodes <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The details of the p+ type region (the first semiconductor region) <b>2</b> and the n+ type region (the second semiconductor region) <b>20</b> are to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Here, the signal charge accumulated in the photodiode <b>1</b> is transferred to the detecting capacitor unit <b>9</b> by turning on the transfer gate <b>8</b>. The detecting capacitor unit <b>9</b> is connected to the source region <b>7</b> of the reset transistor and the gate <b>11</b> of the amplifying transistor. When turning on the reset transistor, the detecting capacitor unit <b>9</b> containing the signal charge is reset. Furthermore, by turning on the amplifying transistor after transferring the signal charge from the transfer transistor to the detecting capacitor unit <b>9</b>, a voltage corresponding to the signal charge is outputted from the source of the amplifying transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thus, when a pair of an amplifying transistor and a reset transistor is commonly used for the photodiodes <b>1</b>, it becomes possible to improve an area occupancy percentage in which the photodiodes occupy an area of one cell compared to an area occupancy percentage in the case where a pair of an amplifying transistor and a reset transistor is provided for one photodiode <b>1</b>. Normally, the area occupancy percentage is increased approximately by 10 to 50 percentages. By increasing the area occupied by the photodiodes <b>1</b>, it becomes possible to increase the number of electrons capable of being accumulated in the photodiode <b>1</b> and thus to improve the electron saturation amount and the sensitivity. With this, a higher-definition image can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Note that an element isolation region is formed between adjacent pixels and between functional regions in a pixel. The element isolation region has a structure using a Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) process or a LOCOS (Local Oxidation of Silicon) process.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The transfer gate <b>8</b> is arranged in a diagonal direction with respect to the photodiode <b>1</b> in the solid-state imaging device of the first embodiment. This is because a motion of electrons (leakage) is reduced between the photodiode <b>1</b> and the detecting capacitor unit <b>9</b> when turning off the transfer gate <b>8</b>, and a gate length of the transfer gate <b>8</b> is ensured to be a predetermined length or more. In the solid-state imaging device according to the first embodiment, such placement of the transfer gate <b>8</b> is for striking a balance between preventing leakage of electrons when turning off the transfer gate <b>8</b> and making the device finer.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, the placement of the power voltage contact <b>30</b> and the substrate contact <b>3</b> is to be described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The first semiconductor region <b>2</b> on which the substrate contact <b>3</b> is connected is formed normally as a p-type region that is of the same type as a common well. Furthermore, the second semiconductor region <b>20</b> on which the power voltage contact <b>30</b> is connected is formed as an n-type region having the conductivity type opposite to that of the first semiconductor region <b>2</b>. Furthermore, the unit pixel (the second unit pixel) including the n-type second semiconductor region <b>20</b> having the conductivity type opposite to that of the first semiconductor region and the unit pixel (the first unit pixel) having the first semiconductor region <b>2</b> are cyclically or randomly arranged in the solid-state imaging device according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When the first and the second unit pixel are cyclically arranged, it is desirable that the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel are only arranged in one of a row direction and a column direction, and are arranged both in a row direction and a column direction cyclically.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">First, the case where the first and the second unit pixel are cyclically arranged only in a row direction, in particular, the two-row cycle is to be described. In the two-row cycle, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the n-type second semiconductor region <b>20</b> and the p-type first semiconductor region <b>2</b> are adjacent to both sides of the photodiode <b>1</b>. Thus, although the electrons generated in the n-type region do not move to the photodiode <b>1</b>, the electrons generated in the p-type region move to the photodiode <b>1</b>. In this case, the number of electrons entering from the adjacent semiconductor region to the photodiode <b>1</b> becomes a half of the number of electrons entering in the case where the n-type semiconductor regions are adjacent to both sides of the photodiode <b>1</b>. Furthermore, when the first unit pixel is arranged at every ten rows, the number of electrons entering from the adjacent semiconductor region to the photodiode becomes one tenth of the number of electrons in the aforementioned case.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Normally, although the number of electrons accumulated in a photodiode ranges from 1,000 to 50,000, the number of electrons entering from the adjacent semiconductor region to the photodiode can be reduced approximately to 100, and even to 10 or less at the minimum. Thus, an influence of the number of electrons entering from the adjacent semiconductor region to the photodiode is limited to 1 percentage or less, and thus, the influence on the sensitivity output extremely becomes small. Accordingly, a preferable image can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Note that the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel may correspond to the aforementioned cell made up of pixels and may not necessarily correspond to the cell. For example, the first unit pixel or the second unit pixel may be a set of pixels rectangularly arranged, such as a set of: (a) four pixels in a cell; (b) four pixels rectangularly adjacent at the left, right, top and the bottom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>; and (c) eight pixels rectangularly adjacent at the left, right, top and the bottom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (2 rows&#xd7;4 columns or 4 rows&#xd7;2 columns).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Furthermore, when the solid-state imaging device has a pixel-in-one-cell structure that is different from the one in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel may correspond to a cell (in other words, a pixel) or may include pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In other words, the first unit pixel has only to include one or more of the photodiodes <b>1</b>, the first semiconductor region (p+ type semiconductor region) <b>2</b>, and the first contact (substrate contact <b>3</b>). Furthermore, the second unit pixel has only to include one or more of the photodiodes <b>1</b>, the second semiconductor region (n+ type semiconductor region) <b>20</b>, and the second contact (power voltage contact <b>30</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, a case where unit pixels are cyclically arranged not only in a row direction, but also in a row direction and in a column direction is described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> illustrate examples of the first unit pixel and the second unit pixel, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A structural unit u<b>1</b> indicated by a bold line within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is one of the examples of the first unit pixel, and includes eight pixels (photodiode <b>1</b>), the p+ type first semiconductor region <b>2</b>, the substrate contact <b>3</b>, and further, the power voltage contact <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A structural unit u<b>2</b> indicated by a bold line within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is one of the examples of the second unit pixel, and includes eight pixels (photodiode <b>1</b>), and two sets of the n+ type second semiconductor region <b>20</b> and the power voltage contact <b>30</b> but does not include the substrate contact <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As such, the structural unit u<b>1</b> has a structure in which a substrate contact is formed per eight photodiodes. On the other hand, the structural unit u<b>2</b> has a structure in which the n+ type second semiconductor region <b>20</b> is formed in which an ion species that has a conductivity type opposite to that of the p-type common well is implanted and furthermore, the power voltage contact <b>30</b> is formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an example of the placement of the structural units u<b>1</b> and the structural units u<b>2</b> which are cyclically arranged in both the row direction and column direction. As illustrated in the diagram, by cyclically arranging the units in both the row direction and column direction, it becomes possible to reduce a ratio of photodiodes in which the sensitivity is deteriorated to all of the photodiodes included in a pixel array, with a phenomenon that electrons caused by angular light move to a adjacent photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Note that in the solid-state imaging device according to the first embodiment of the present invention, as long as one of pixels including the substrate contact <b>3</b> is included in photodiodes that are arranged in approximately 50 rows&#xd7;50 columns, it becomes possible to prevent the high-speed operation from being degraded for the time period when the p-type common well varies until it is recovered, and to sufficiently prevent variations of the pixel sensitivity in photodiodes from occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Note that normally, the substrate contact <b>3</b> has only to be included in 10 rows&#xd7;10 columns to in 100 rows&#xd7;100 columns.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Note that in the solid-state imaging device according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the effects of reducing the variations in sensitivity can be larger by arranging the structure units in a column and a row direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Compared to the solid-state imaging device in the first embodiment, a gate electrode and a dummy wiring that have the same shape and are made of the same material as the gate electrode are provided in the second embodiment. With such additional elements, the second embodiment describes the solid-state imaging device that reduces variations of a reflection and a scattering of incident light entering a photodiode which are caused by a difference in the placement of a gate electrode or the presence or absence of the gate electrode and that reduces the number of the generated electrons caused by angular light. Here, the dummy wirings have the same shape as those of the amplifying gate <b>11</b> and the reset gate <b>10</b>, and the dummy wirings are formed so that a relative position of the dummy wiring and the photodiode is the same as a relative position of the amplifying gate <b>11</b>, the reset gate <b>10</b>, and the photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">With reference to the diagrams, the solid-state imaging device according to the second embodiment of the present invention is to be described.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a structure of main units in the solid-state imaging device according to the second embodiment of the present invention. The solid-state imaging device in the diagram is different from the solid-state imaging device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in having: dummy wirings <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> on the first semiconductor region <b>2</b> and the second semiconductor region <b>20</b>; a p+ type region <b>2</b><i>a</i>, a first semiconductor region <b>2</b><i>b</i>, and a p+ type region <b>2</b><i>c </i>instead of the first semiconductor region <b>2</b>; and an n+ type region <b>20</b><i>a</i>, a second semiconductor region <b>20</b><i>b</i>, and an n+ type region <b>20</b><i>c </i>instead of the second semiconductor region <b>20</b>. The following mainly describes the different points other than the same points as in the aforementioned description for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The dummy wirings <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> have the same shape and are made of the same material as those of the reset gate <b>10</b> and the amplifying gate <b>11</b>, and are arranged in the same position relative to the photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Since an ion species is not implanted immediately under the dummy wirings <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, three small regions, namely, the p+ type region <b>2</b><i>a</i>, the first semiconductor region <b>2</b><i>b</i>, and the p+ type region <b>2</b><i>c </i>are formed instead of the first semiconductor region <b>2</b>. Similarly, three small regions, namely, the n+ type region <b>20</b><i>a</i>, the second semiconductor region <b>20</b><i>b</i>, and the n+ type region <b>20</b><i>c </i>are formed instead of the second semiconductor region <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9E</figref>, the solid-state imaging device according to the second embodiment of the present invention is to be described in details.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref> are cross-sectional views of the solid-state imaging device in the case where a dummy wiring is formed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a Section A-A&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a Section B-B&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a Section C-C&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9D and 9E</figref> are cross-sectional views of the solid-state imaging device in the case where a dummy wiring is not formed (FIG. <b>4</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a section corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, in the case where a dummy wiring is not formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a section corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, in the case where a dummy wiring is not formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">A solid-state imaging device is designed so as to collect light to a photodiode at a maximum through a collecting lens. However, there are cases where light leaks to the semiconductor regions <b>7</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> without collecting light to the photodiode. Note that generally, an amount of leakage light is approximately 5 to 10% of the total amount of incident light.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, there are cases where light is reflected from a gate electrode, and part of light is directed toward the photodiode in the semiconductor regions <b>5</b> to <b>7</b>. When the is dummy wiring is not arranged, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9D and 9E</figref>, the way light reflects differs between the second semiconductor region <b>20</b> and the first semiconductor region <b>2</b>, and light is absorbed inside the substrate. Thus, in a pixel of the photodiode adjacent to the second semiconductor region <b>20</b>, the sensitivity varies, compared to a pixel in other than the region.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref>, a dummy wiring is arranged in the solid-state imaging device according to the second embodiment of the present invention so as to make the way the leakage light reflects (in other words, a light path) identical to a way leakage light reflects on the semiconductor regions <b>5</b> to <b>7</b> each including a gate electrode. Furthermore, with a reflection and a scattering of incident light that are caused by a difference in a structure of the dummy wirings <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> and the gate electrodes <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>, an amount of light entering each photodiode can be made identical to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">More specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, with the formation of a dummy wiring, it becomes possible to make the way light scatters and reflects identical outside of the photodiode region, regardless of whether a region adjacent to each photodiode is a region for a reset transistor, a region for an amplifying transistor, or a region in which a contact is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">To sum up, with the formation of a dummy wiring, it becomes possible to make a light scattering and a light reflection identical in each pixel. Furthermore, it becomes possible to form a dummy wiring in the same manufacturing process for forming the gate electrodes <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. In other words, without increasing the number of processes, it becomes possible to obtain uniformity in sensitivity between pixels in a very effective manner.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Furthermore, when forming a dummy wiring in the second semiconductor region (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>) in which a power voltage contact is formed, it becomes possible to make a potential in the second semiconductor region entirely identical by introducing n+ ionized impurities in a source/drain region and further by introducing n-type impurities under the dummy wiring <b>14</b>. With this, the potential becomes a floating situation in a region which is separated by a dummy wiring, and thus, it becomes possible to prevent noise from occurring from the region.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the third embodiment, the solid-state imaging device in which the n+ type regions <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>are formed instead of the p+ type regions <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>c </i>and further the power voltage contact <b>30</b> is added to the n+ type regions <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>is to be described, compared to the solid-state imaging device according to the second embodiment.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a structure of main units in the solid-state imaging device according to the third embodiment.

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The way the n+ type regions <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>are formed instead of the p+ type regions <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>c </i>is that, in manufacturing processes, the p+ type implanting region is formed only in a region in which the substrate contact <b>3</b> sandwiched by the dummy wirings <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> is to be formed and that in a region other than a region that sandwiches the dummy wirings <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, an n+ type ion species is implanted so as to form an n+ type region.

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the regions <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>are made n+ type regions in the solid-state imaging device according to the third embodiment of the present invention. With this, when light enters, it becomes possible that the electrons generated within a substrate move to the regions <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c</i>, but not to a photodiode. This is because the regions <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>are connected to the power voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As such, according to the third embodiment of the present invention, the p+ type semiconductor region <b>2</b><i>b</i>, two dummy wirings that are adjacent to both sides of the p+ type semiconductor region <b>2</b><i>b</i>, and two regions that are adjacent to opposite sides of the two dummy wirings and that sandwich the p+ type semiconductor region <b>2</b><i>b </i>are arranged.

<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> illustrate respective structures of main units in the solid-state imaging device according to the fourth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Since the same reference numerals are used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> for the same units as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the description is omitted. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the signal reading line <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> in the detecting capacitor unit and the power voltage wiring <b>12</b> are arranged so as to sandwich the photodiodes <b>1</b>. When turning on the transfer gate <b>8</b>, the signal reading line <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> in the detecting capacitor unit is arranged so as to read a potential caused by a charge accumulated in the detecting capacitor unit <b>9</b>. In other words, by electrically connecting the detecting capacitor unit <b>9</b> and the amplifying gate <b>11</b> to a contact (unillustrated) and a metal wiring (unillustrated), a charge signal that is accumulated in the detecting capacitor unit <b>9</b> through the amplifying gate <b>11</b> is amplified, and the signal is read through the signal reading line <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> of the detecting capacitor unit and though the signal reading contact <b>17</b>A. Furthermore, the power voltage wiring <b>12</b> is arranged so as to supply the power voltage by electrically connecting to the power voltage contact <b>17</b> for a transistor and other contacts through a metal wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Here, it becomes possible to reduce sensitivity variations by arranging, in the same structure, the signal reading line <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> in the detecting capacitor unit and the power voltage wiring <b>12</b> for the photodiodes <b>1</b>. When the wiring structure is different, the variation occurs due to a difference in a reflection and a scattering of incident light for each of the photodiodes <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Furthermore, voltage supplying wirings <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>15</b>-<b>2</b> are arranged for applying a voltage to the transfer gates <b>8</b>. Furthermore, in order to easily connect to the transfer gates through contacts, the voltage supplying wirings <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>15</b>-<b>2</b> for the transfer gate are formed in the lowest layer, rather than being formed in the second layer.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Furthermore, a wiring <b>18</b>-<b>1</b> connected to the reset gates <b>10</b> through contacts (unillustrated) and a wiring <b>18</b>-<b>2</b> connected to the amplifying gates <b>11</b> through contacts (unillustrated) are formed. Furthermore, the wirings <b>18</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>18</b>-<b>2</b> are formed as metal wirings in the lowest layer, as the wirings <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>15</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">As described above, the fourth embodiment is characterized in that the signal reading line <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> in the detecting capacitor unit and the power voltage wiring <b>12</b> are formed as metal wirings in the second layer and a layer higher than the second layer.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Furthermore, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when incident light from a collecting lens is focused on a portion close to a surface of the photodiode <b>1</b>, since light is more exposed to metal wirings in the top layers, the wiring at the second layer rather than the first layer easily reflects or scatters light entering the photodiode <b>1</b>. Furthermore, since the wiring in the second layer serves as connecting a wiring in the first layer to a wiring in the third or higher layers, a opening width of an opening on the photodiode <b>1</b> (the smallest width) or the area of the opening becomes the smallest opening width or the smallest area. Furthermore, the opening widths of the openings on the photodiodes <b>1</b> (opening widths A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) include the smallest width between the signal reading line <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> in the detecting capacitor unit and the power voltage wiring <b>12</b>. When a shape of the metal wiring in the second layer is different for each of the photodiodes <b>1</b>, a sensitivity difference occurs between the photodiodes <b>1</b>. However, since the metal wirings in the second layer have the identical shape with respect to each of the adjacent photodiodes <b>1</b> in the fourth embodiment, it is possible to reduce the sensitivity variations.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As described above, the fourth embodiment is characterized in that a photodiode adjacent to the third semiconductor region and a photodiode adjacent to the fourth semiconductor region have the same structure in the shape of the metal wiring in the second layer.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Note that according to the fourth embodiment, the dummy wiring <b>18</b>-<b>3</b> is formed, without electrically connecting to other wirings and contacts, by forming the same shape of the metal wiring in the first layer with respect to each of the photodiodes <b>1</b>, and thus, the sensitivity difference between the photodiodes can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Furthermore, the sensitivity difference between the photodiodes can be further reduced by combining the fourth embodiment with one of the first to third embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">More specifically, in the second semiconductor region that is formed on the common well and that has the same conductivity type (p+ type) as that of the common well, and in the fourth semiconductor region including the source region <b>5</b> of the amplifying transistor, the common drain region <b>6</b>, and the source region <b>7</b> of the reset transistor, the first unit pixels in the first, second, and third embodiments are made the same structure in the shape of the metal wiring in the second layer.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Alternatively, in the second semiconductor region that is formed on the common well and that has the conductivity type (n+ type) opposite to that of the common well, and in the fourth semiconductor region including the source region <b>5</b> of the amplifying transistor, the common drain region <b>6</b>, and the source region <b>7</b> of the reset transistor, the second unit pixel is made the same structure in the shape of the metal wiring in the second layer.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Alternatively, the sensitivity difference between the photodiodes can be further reduced by making the structure in the shape of the metal wiring in the second layer of the first unit pixel and second unit pixel identical to each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Common Elements in all of the Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The solid-state imaging device according to the first to fourth embodiments is installed in an imaging apparatus, such as a digital camera.

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A control system for an electrical power generation system (EPGS) provides overload protection without disconnecting a generator of the EPGS from an excessive electrical load. Available engine power and current levels of the electrical load are continuously measured. A command voltage is calculated that corresponds to a voltage required to sustain with the maximum available power. Output voltage of a generator of the EPGS is controlled at the calculated command voltage so that a power limit of the engine is not exceeded during electrical overload conditions.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is in the field of electrical power generating and, more particularly, electrical power generating systems (EPGS) that may be subjected to electrical overloading.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In some applications of EPGS's, electrical loading may produce electrical power that exceed available power deliverable to a shaft of a generator of the EPGS. An aircraft power system may be one example of such an application of an EPGS. In an aircraft, a shaft driven generator may be powered with a turbine engine. Conditions may arise, during operation of the aircraft, when electrical power demands increase rapidly. In some cases, these demands, or increases in electrical load may exceed the shaft power available to drive the generator. The generator-driving engine may become overloaded and lose speed. In extreme cases, the engine may stall and require re-starting.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the prior-art, overload protection systems were employed to reduce or prevent engine overloading resulting from excessive increases in electrical loading. Prior art protection systems provide temporary electrical disconnection of excessive electrical load from the generator. Such temporary disconnection may occur for a time interval sufficient to allow the electrical load to decrease. After the electrical load reaches an acceptably reduced level, the load is then re-applied to the generator.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an operating aircraft, a loss of electrical power may be catastrophic. Consequently, prior art protection systems provide mechanisms for avoiding a total absence of electrical power during the temporary disconnection period. For example, batteries or banks of capacitors (so-called supercapacitors) may provide temporary electrical power. However, in these prior-art overload protection systems, a certain time delay may be experienced before an alternate source of electrical power becomes available to the electrical load. This is because it is necessary to recognize a need for and then connect these alternate sources of electrical power to the load. Typically, this recognition and connecting process occurs through switching arrangements that require a finite time period for completion. This may result in a brief but nevertheless finite period of time when the electrical load is not provided with electrical power. Transition from one source to another without interruption is not a trivial task. Transient behavior may create serious disturbances to the loads that are connected to the bus. In addition, as is the case with almost any aircraft electrical component, the presence of batteries or supercapacitors may add undesired weight and a need for complex wiring interconnection within the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As can be seen, there is a need to provide a protection system for an EPGS that prevents engine overloading without a loss of electrical power to an excessive electrical load. Additionally, in the case of an aircraft, there is a need to provide such a protection system without adding weight or external wiring interconnections to the aircraft.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect of the present invention, a control system for an electrical power generating system (EPGS) comprises a calculating device for determining a required voltage needed to sustain a measured current level of an electrical load with available power of an engine of the EPGS. A voltage controller provides control of an output of a generator of the EPGS at a voltage that corresponds to the calculated required voltage when electrical load on the EPGS exceeds the available power of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect of the present invention, a control apparatus for an electrical power generating system (EGPS) comprises a sensor for sensing a level of current of an electrical load applied to a generator of the EPGS, a controller for controlling output voltage of the generator, and a calculating device for determining a voltage required to provide the sensed level of current to the electrical load with power available from an engine of the EPGS. The calculating device and the controller are interconnected so that the output voltage corresponds to the determined voltage when the electrical load exceeds power available from the engine whereby overload protection is provided for the engine and the generator.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect of the present invention, a method for controlling an electrical power generation system (EPGS) comprises the steps of determining available power from an engine of the EPGS, determining a current level on a power bus of the EPGS, calculating a voltage required to sustain the determined current level with the determined available power from the engine, and controlling an output voltage of a generator of the EPGS at the calculated voltage.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Broadly, the present invention may be useful for providing overload protection of an EPGS. More particularly, the present invention may provide a system for altering a voltage at which power is delivered by a generator when an electrical overload develops. The present invention may be particularly useful in vehicles such as aircraft in which electrical loads may rapidly increase and in which even brief loss of electrical power may not be tolerable.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In contrast to prior-art overload protection systems, among other things, the present invention may embody a system in which electrical current may be provided, at a reduced voltage, to an electrical load when the electrical load exceeds power available at a shaft of an engine driving a generator of an EPGS. Instead of disconnecting an excessive electrical load from a generator, the present invention may reduce output voltage of a generator to permit continued delivery of power to an electrical load when the electrical load exceeds available shaft power thus protecting the engine from overloading and stalling. Additionally, the present invention may provide overload protection with no interruption of current flowing to an electrical load. And further, the present invention may provide overload protection without use of auxiliary electrical energy sources such as batteries or capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram symbolically illustrates an electric power generation system, designated generally by the numeral <b>10</b> (hereinafter EPGS <b>10</b>). The EPGS <b>10</b> may comprise a rotating-shaft electrical generator <b>11</b> and a control system <b>12</b>. The generator <b>11</b> may be driven by an engine <b>13</b>. The generator <b>11</b> may be interconnected to a power bus <b>14</b> through an inverter <b>16</b>. The inverter <b>16</b> may be provided with voltage control from a voltage controller <b>17</b> which may be a component of the control system <b>12</b>. The voltage controller <b>17</b> may be employed to control the inverter <b>16</b> to rectify the output from the generator <b>11</b> into a desired DC output voltage. The voltage controller <b>17</b> may be commanded to maintain a particular voltage through a voltage command signal input <b>18</b> (V<sub>cmd</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An overload protection system <b>20</b> may provide overload protection for the generator <b>11</b> and the engine <b>13</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, the overload protection system <b>20</b> may be comprised of various logic and calculating blocks of a conventional microprocessor or digital signal processor (DSP) <b>21</b>. The DSP <b>21</b> may also embody elements of the control system <b>12</b> such as the voltage controller <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The overload protection system <b>20</b> may comprise a calculating device or W/I calculator block <b>22</b> (hereinafter W/I block <b>22</b>), a mechanical loss calculator block <b>24</b>, an electrical loss calculator block <b>26</b> and a voltage comparator <b>28</b>. The overload protection system <b>20</b> may interconnected with the EPGS <b>10</b> through a current sensor <b>29</b> so that digital representations of current level in the power bus <b>14</b> may be transmitted to the W/I block <b>22</b> through a current input <b>30</b>. Conventional sensors (not shown) may provide an engine shaft power signal <b>32</b> (W<sub>shaft</sub>) to the mechanical loss calculator block <b>24</b> and a mechanical loss signal <b>34</b> (L<sub>mech</sub>) to the block <b>24</b>. Another conventional sensor (not shown) may provide an electrical loss signal <b>36</b> ((L<sub>elec</sub>) to the electrical loss calculator block <b>26</b>. The output of the calculator block <b>26</b> may produce a calculated available electric power signal <b>38</b> (W<sub>E</sub>)</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The loss calculator blocks <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> may be interconnected with the W/I block <b>22</b> so that the W/I block <b>22</b> may produce a voltage command signal <b>40</b> (V<b>1</b><sub>cmd</sub>) and provide the V<b>1</b><sub>cmd </sub>signal <b>40</b> to the voltage comparator <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A reference voltage source <b>42</b> may be interconnected with the voltage comparator <b>28</b> to provide a reference voltage signal <b>43</b> (V<sub>ref</sub>) to the voltage comparator <b>28</b>. When electrical load demands on the EPGS <b>10</b> are less than or equal to W<sub>E</sub>, the W/I block <b>22</b> may provide a V<b>1</b><sub>CMD </sub>signal <b>40</b> that is higher than or equal to V<sub>ref</sub>. The voltage comparator <b>28</b> may then produce an inverter command signal, V<sub>cmd </sub>signal <b>18</b>, at a voltage which is the equal to V<sub>ref</sub>. The voltage regulator <b>17</b> may then regulate voltage of power provided to the power bus <b>14</b> at the voltage V<sub>ref</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When electrical load demand exceeds W<sub>E</sub>, the W/I block <b>22</b> may produce the V<b>1</b><sub>CMD </sub>signal <b>40</b> at a voltage that is less than the voltage V<sub>ref</sub>. In that case the voltage comparator may provide the V<sub>cmd </sub>signal <b>18</b> at a voltage less than V<sub>ref</sub>. For example, if V<sub>ref </sub>is 115 V. and V<b>1</b><sub>CMD </sub>may be determined to be 83.3 V. A voltage signal of 83.3 V. may be produced as the V<b>1</b><sub>CMD </sub>voltage and provided to the input <b>40</b> of the voltage comparator <b>28</b>. The voltage comparator <b>28</b> may then produce V<sub>cmd </sub>at a voltage of 83.3 V. The voltage regulator <b>17</b> may then command the inverter <b>16</b> to deliver power to the power bus <b>14</b> at a voltage of 83.3 V.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a more detailed understanding of operational aspects of the present invention may be realized. A voltage versus current graph <b>200</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A solid horizontal line <b>202</b> may represent a desired voltage of operation of the EGPS <b>10</b>. This line <b>202</b> may correspond to V<sub>ref</sub>. A dashed horizontal line <b>204</b> may represent a minimum voltage V<sub>min</sub>. V<sub>min </sub>may be a voltage below which certain electrical power loads may be damaged. For example a small electric motor connected to the power bus <b>14</b> may rapidly overheat if it is supplied with electrical power at a voltage lower than V<sub>min</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A curved line or power limit curve <b>206</b> may represent a power limit relationship between current and voltage. The power limit curve <b>206</b> may define a voltage at which a particular current level may be sustained in the power bus <b>14</b>. It may be seen that for any current level less than that represented at a point <b>206</b><i>a</i>, power may be supplied at the voltage V<sub>ref</sub>. At these current levels, a power limit of the engine <b>13</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will not be exceeded when electrical power is delivered at V<sub>ref</sub>. However, if current level on the power bus <b>14</b> exceeds the current represented by the point <b>206</b><i>a</i>, then the electrical power may be provided in accordance with the voltage-current relationship defined by the power limit curve <b>206</b>. As current level increases, voltage is reduced in correspondence to the power limit curve <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The power limit curve <b>206</b> may represent power limits for the engine <b>13</b> in a first set of engine operating conditions. However the power limit of the engine <b>13</b> may be altered during its operation. For example, the engine <b>13</b> may be provided with a fuel boost or thrust loads on the engine may decrease or increase. In these changed circumstances the power limit of the engine <b>13</b> may not be accurately represented by the power limit curve <b>206</b>. A changed engine power limit may be more suitably represented by other power limit curves such <b>208</b> or <b>210</b>. The power limit curve <b>210</b> may represent a condition in which the engine <b>13</b> may be able to provide more deliverable power than that represented by the power limit curve <b>206</b>. The power limit curve <b>208</b>, on the other hand, may represent lower engine power availability.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Voltage-current relationships that correspond to any number of power limit curves such as the curves <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> may be programmed into the W/I block <b>22</b>. The W/I block <b>22</b> may apply data received through the inputs <b>30</b> and <b>38</b> to these programmed relationships in order to calculate and provide a proper level of V<b>1</b><sub>cmd </sub>voltage to the input <b>40</b> of the voltage comparator <b>28</b>. Calculation transitions may be made between and among any number of the programmed power limit curves such as <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> or <b>210</b> as engine power availability changes. This concept is illustrated graphically with a transition line <b>212</b> connecting points <b>206</b><i>b </i>and <b>210</b><i>a </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The W/I block <b>22</b> may perform numerous calculations in rapid succession. Typically, these calculations may be performed at a rate of between about two to about five calculations per millisecond (msec.). Newly acquired input data is provided to the W/I block <b>22</b> for each calculation. Consequently, the overload protection system <b>20</b> may have virtually instantaneous responsiveness to changes in electrical load and engine power availability. The system <b>20</b> may provide protection immediately whenever it may be needed without any interruption of current on the power bus <b>14</b>. Conversely, a desired V<sub>ref </sub>may be restored immediately when overload protection is no longer needed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. An EGPS <b>300</b> may be configured with a control system <b>312</b> having an overload protection system <b>320</b>. The overload protection system <b>320</b> may comprise a voltage comparator <b>322</b>, a proportional integral (PI) regulator <b>324</b>, a shaft speed/power analyzer <b>326</b> and an error calculator <b>328</b>. A generator <b>330</b> may be provided with a shaft position sensor <b>332</b>. In all other respects the elements of the EPGS <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are equivalent to those of the EPGS <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In operation, the overload protection system <b>320</b> may utilize the PI regulator <b>324</b>, the error calculator <b>328</b> and the shaft speed/power analyzer <b>326</b> to calculate a V<b>1</b><sub>CMD</sub>. An available mechanical power signal <b>327</b> (W<sub>EA</sub>) is obtained from shaft speed signals from the shaft positions sensor <b>332</b> and predefined loss values programmed into the speed/power analyzer <b>326</b>. The V<sub>cmd </sub>voltage provided to the voltage regulator <b>17</b> may be equal to V<sub>ref </sub>when the W<sub>EA </sub>signal <b>327</b> is greater than electrical power demand. The PI regulator <b>324</b> may produce the V<b>1</b><sub>cmd </sub>signal <b>18</b> by converting a difference between the W<sub>EA </sub>signal <b>327</b> and a measured power demand signal <b>329</b> (W<sub>EE</sub>). The V<b>1</b><sub>cmd </sub>signal <b>18</b> may be lower than V<sub>ref </sub>when the W<sub>EE </sub>signal <b>329</b> exceeds the available electrical power signal <b>327</b> (W<sub>EA</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It may be noted that the control system <b>12</b> and the overload protection system <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be incorporated into a single microprocessor or DSP such as the DSP <b>21</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Consequently, the overload protection system <b>20</b> may be introduced into a typical pre-existing aircraft design without adding weight or external wiring interconnections. This is because typical existing aircraft designs may already incorporate DSP based or microprocessor based control system for EGPS's. The inventive overload protection system <b>20</b> may be added to a DSP based or microprocessor based EGPS control system by merely programming additional software into the DSP or microprocessor. Similarly the overload protection system <b>320</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be incorporated into a DSP or microprocessor that embodies the control system <b>312</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for achieving overload protection for an EGPS. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates, in block form, a method <b>400</b> for protecting an engine of an EGPS from electrical overloads. In a step <b>402</b>, available engine power may be determined (e.g. through provision of an engine shaft power signal <b>32</b> (W<sub>shaft</sub>)) to the mechanical loss calculator block <b>24</b> and a mechanical loss signal <b>34</b> (L<sub>mech</sub>) to the block <b>24</b> and by provision of an electrical loss signal <b>36</b> (L<sub>elec</sub>) to the electrical loss calculator block <b>26</b>). In a step <b>404</b>, current level in a power bus may be determined (e.g. through the current sensor <b>29</b> on the power bus <b>14</b>). In a step <b>406</b>, a voltage (e.g. V<b>1</b><sub>CMD</sub>) may be calculated (e.g. by the W/I block <b>22</b>), which voltage may sustain the current level determined in step <b>404</b> with the available engine power determined in step <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a step <b>408</b>, a comparison may be made between a reference voltage (e.g. V<sub>ref</sub>) and the voltage calculated in step <b>406</b> to determine which of the two voltages is lower. In a step <b>410</b>, control of voltage delivered to a power bus may be made at the lower of the voltages compared in step <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing relates to exemplary embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of CMOS technology voltage controlled oscillators and phase-locked loops. More particularly, the present invention relates to a wide range/high speed and low power CMOS voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) for digital communications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) are well known and widely used in the electronics industry. Within the digital communications field, VCOs are used in a variety of applications. Such applications include, for example, frequency synthesizers, clock generation and the like. VCOs are typically designed to perform within a given set of boundary conditions and to perform according to a specified standard. Typical conditions include, for example, performance over operating temperature ranges, sensitivity to noise, output sensitivity to interference, and the like. Typical performance standards include, for example, output signal frequency stability, output signal programmability and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical prior art VCO circuit generates an oscillating output signal having a specified frequency. The signal can have several different wave forms (e.g., square, saw tooth, triangular, etc.). The frequency of the output is tunable and is a function of an input voltage, an external resistance or capacitance, or the like. The type of application in which the VCO circuit is used dictates its operating conditions and performance requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, the type of application also largely determines type of fabrication technology used to manufacture the VCO. A large number of modern digital integrated circuits are fabricated using well known and widely used CMOS technology. Where the VCO circuit is included in a CMOS IC (integrated circuit), it is usually fabricated in CMOS (e.g., fabricated using CMOS process technology).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a problem, however, when the application in which the overall IC is used requires the VCO circuit to operate at very high speed with low power while maintaining low noise and low PSS (Power Supply Sensitivity). For example, where the IC is part of a high speed serial transmission system (e.g., high speed wireless transmission systems) it is important that the output frequency of the VCO circuit be stable at high frequency, and be a consistent function of the control inputs while the output frequency exhibits very low phase noise.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Consequently, for these very high performance applications it is important that the VCO circuit provide a very stable, low jitter output signal at high frequencies with low power. However, prior art CMOS VCOs cannot reliably function at such high frequencies with low power while maintaining low jitter and low PSS.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, what is required is a CMOS VCO circuit which solves the high speed operation problems of the prior art. What is required is a circuit capable of reliable operation at high frequencies with low power consumption while exhibiting very low phase noise on the output signal. The present invention provides an advantageous solution to the above requirements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention provide a CMOS VCO circuit which solves the wide range/high speed and low power operation problems of the prior art. The present invention provides circuits capable of reliable operation at high frequencies with low power while exhibiting very low jitter and PSS on the output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the present invention is implemented as a wide range, high speed and low power CMOS voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) circuit. In this implementation, the VCO circuit is a two stage ring oscillator. The VCO circuit includes a VCO input for receiving a control voltage. A first and a second VCO cell are coupled to each other. Each VCO cell comprises an N-type transistor as a source follower whose gate is connected to the input control voltage. Each VCO cell also includes 4 N-type and 4 P-type transistors which form a complimentary CMOS inverter with 2 cross coupled transistors. The existence of the cross coupled transistors is configured to enable the VCO to oscillate with 2 stages.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The attribute whereby the circuit is based on CMOS technology and comprises only 2 stages, the power dissipation will be low and the speed can cover a wide range, from low up to very high speeds. Also the source follower will improve the PSS significantly. Depending on the applications, the output can be taken from one of the VCO cells or from both. Another variation of this circuit can be implemented by connecting the sources of the N-type source followers.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following detailed description of embodiments of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be recognized by one of ordinary skill, in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention provides a CMOS PLL circuit which solves the low spurs operation problems of the prior art. The present invention provides a circuit capable of reliable operation while exhibiting very low spurs on the output signal. The circuit of the present invention produces a stable, output signal with a waveform free of defects and irregularities. The present invention and its benefits are described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention provides a solution which solves the wide range/high speed/low power/low noise problems associated with the prior art. The present invention and its benefits are further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic block diagram of a VCO <b>100</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. VCO <b>100</b> illustrates the general scheme of operation of the present invention. VCO <b>100</b> is comprised of a two inverters where the output of the first inverter is coupled to the input of the second inverter, and the output of the second inverter is coupled to the input of the first inverter. Each inverter has a positive and a negative input and a corresponding positive and negative output. The first inverter, e.g., inverter <b>101</b> of VCO <b>100</b> has its outputs coupled to the inputs of the second inverter <b>102</b>. The outputs of the second inverter <b>120</b> are coupled to the inputs of the first inverter <b>101</b>. The resulting feed back effects an oscillation within VCO <b>100</b>. The frequency of oscillation is variable over a range. The degree of variation is determined by the application of a control voltage to the circuitry comprising each inverter. Feedback to the inputs Vip and Vin from the outputs Vop and Von sustain the oscillation. The output signal of VCO <b>100</b> is typically taken from one or both inverters.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">VCO <b>100</b> functions by maintaining a stable, predictable, output signal having a frequency which corresponds to an externally applied control voltage VCOIN.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the circuit diagram of the VCO cell used in VCO <b>100</b>. VCO cell <b>200</b> includes transistors <b>221</b>-<b>231</b> and <b>222</b>-<b>232</b> as complementary CMOS inverters and transistors <b>223</b>-<b>224</b> and <b>233</b>-<b>234</b> as cross-coupled transistors. The cross-coupled transistors do two things. First, they don't let the inverters <b>221</b>-<b>231</b> and <b>222</b>-<b>232</b> operate independently, and they keep the timing relationship between the inverters with 180 phase difference. Second, they create extra gain and extra phase shift so that the oscillator can oscillate with only 2 stages. Transistors <b>221</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>223</b> and <b>224</b> are all connected to node &#x2018;A&#x2019;, and node &#x2018;A&#x2019; is coupled to Vdd through source follower transistor <b>203</b>. Voltages Vip and Vin are respectively coupled to inverters <b>221</b>-<b>231</b> and <b>222</b>-<b>232</b>. The outputs are taken from nodes Vop and Von. As the VCOIN Moves, node &#x2018;A&#x2019; follows with the same manner with some voltage difference which depends on the type of N transistor used for the source follower and its size and the size of the rest of the transistors and the voltage of VCOIN. The N transistor in the source follower can also be a native device. Since this complementary inverters with cross-coupled transistor has a very high gain, even with low voltage at node &#x2018;A&#x2019; this oscillator can oscillate. Therefore, this oscillator can cover a very wide range, and the fact that it is only a 2 stage VCO, it can operate up to a very high frequency. Also the complementary CMOS architecture with cross-coupled transistors generates sharp-edges while consuming low power. The transistor sizes can be adjusted to get same rise and fall time, and consequently a symmetrical waveform which reduces the phase noise. The source follower will isolate Vdd from node &#x2018;A&#x2019; so it reduces the PSS.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. shows an alternate VCO with respect to FIG. <b>1</b>., where node &#x2018;A&#x2019; in both VCO cells are connected together, so the source followers will be in parallel and can be shown as one transistor with 2&#xd7; size. In this case the VCO cells <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> will be similar to what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The same argument can be applied to this architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be noted that the source follower in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> can be replaced by a unity gain amplifier. Additionally, it should be noted that each of the above VCOs can be designed with more than 2 stages to provide lower speed and higher power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto and their equivalents.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a display panel, and in particular, to a display panel employed in an organic light emitting display device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a conventional organic light emitting display panel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a panel <b>1</b> comprises a data driver <b>11</b>, a scan driver <b>12</b>, and a display array <b>13</b>. The data driver <b>11</b> controls a plurality of data lines DL<sub>1 </sub>to DL<sub>n</sub>, and the scan driver <b>12</b> controls a plurality of scan lines SL<sub>1 </sub>to SL<sub>m</sub>. Interlaced data lines DL<sub>1 </sub>to DL<sub>n </sub>and scan lines SL<sub>1 </sub>to SL<sub>m </sub>form a display array <b>13</b>. Each pair of the interlaced data line and scan line corresponds to a display unit. For example, the interlaced data line DL<sub>1 </sub>and scan line SL<sub>1 </sub>correspond to a display unit <b>100</b>. As with any other display unit, the equivalent circuit of the display unit <b>100</b> comprises a switch transistor T<b>11</b>, a storage capacitor Cs<b>1</b>, a driving transistor T<b>12</b>, and an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) D<b>1</b>. The driving transistor T<b>12</b> is a PMOS transistor, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The scan driver <b>12</b> sequentially outputs scan signals to the scan lines SL<sub>1 </sub>to SL<sub>m </sub>to turn on the switch transistors within all display units corresponding to one row and turn off the switch transistors within all display units corresponding to all other rows. The data driver <b>11</b> outputs video signals with gray scale values to the display units corresponding to one row through the data lines DL<sub>1 </sub>to DL<sub>n </sub>according to prepared but not yet displayed image data. For example, when the scan driver <b>12</b> outputs a scan signal to the scan line SL<sub>1</sub>, the switch transistor T<b>11</b> within the display unit <b>100</b> is turned on. The data driver <b>11</b> then outputs a corresponding video signal to the display unit <b>100</b> through the data line DL<sub>1</sub>, and the storage capacitor Cs<b>1</b> stores the voltage of the video signal. The driving transistor T<b>12</b> provides a driving current Id<b>1</b> to drive the OLED D<b>1</b> to emit light according to the stored voltage in the storage capacitor Cs<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Because the OLED D<b>1</b> is a current-driving element, the brightness of the OLED D<b>1</b> is determined by the intensity of the driving current Id<b>1</b>. The driving current Id<b>1</b> is a drain current of the driving transistor T<b>12</b> and refers to the driving capability thereof. The driving current Id<b>1</b> is represented by the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>id</i>1=<i>k</i>(<i>vsg+vth</i>)<sup>2 </sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">where id1, k, vsg and vth represent a value of the driving current Id<b>1</b>, a conductive parameter of the driving transistor T<b>12</b>, a value of the source-gate voltage Vsg of the driving transistor T<b>12</b>, and a threshold voltage of the driving transistor T<b>12</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Because the driving transistors in different regions of the display array <b>13</b> are not electrically identical due to the fabrication process thereof, the threshold voltages of the driving transistors are unequal. When the display units within different regions receive the same video signal, the driving current respectively provided by the driving transistors of the display units is not equal due to the unequal threshold voltages of the driving transistors. Thus, brightness of the OLEDs is not equal, resulting in unequal OLED light-emission intensity in a frame cycle and uneven images displayed on the panel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, because the driving transistor T<b>12</b> is a PMOS transistor, an input port <b>21</b> of a power line on the panel <b>1</b> is coupled to a voltage source Vdd. A person having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the input port <b>21</b> of the power line is coupled to a voltage source Vss when the driving transistor T<b>12</b> is an NMOS transistor. According to the disposition of the power lines on the panel <b>1</b>, the display unit, which farther from the input port <b>21</b>, corresponds to greater equivalent resistance of the power line. Thus, because the display unit is closer to the input port <b>21</b>, brightness is greater, while the brightness of the display unit farther from the input port <b>21</b> is less bright, resulting in unequal brightness.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Presently, users wishing to input hand-drawn information into a computer system typically do so using a computer mouse or digitizing tablet. Whilst such interface systems are useful, they are relatively bulky, and they lack tactile feedback provided to a user drawing on a piece of paper with a pen. Moreover, in many situations, paper is a more physically comfortable and convenient drawing medium, due to its visual characteristics and its portability compared to other computer interface devices. However, it lacks many of the advantages of drawing directly into a computer system. For example, data in a computer system is easy to archive and then search, while paper is bulky to archive and inconvenient to search.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>

The tags are preferably printed using an ink that absorbs near infrared light but is substantially invisible to a human viewer under normal lighting conditions. When a user brings a sensing end of the stylus close to the surface, one or more of the tags are imaged, interpreted and decoded to provide an indication of the identity of the region from which the tag was imaged.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The movement data can be generated in any of a number of ways. In one form, the coded data includes information indicative of positions of points within the region, and the movement data is based on coded data sensed by the sensing device as it is moved relative to the surface. Alternatively, the movement data can be generated in ways not related to the coded data, such as by use of accelerometers within the sensing device or by physical rollerballs or wheels associated with the sensing device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further aspects of the invention will become apparent from reading the following detailed description of preferred and other embodiments of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0023" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED AND OTHER EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">Note: Memjet&#x2122; is a trade mark of Silverbrook Research Pty Ltd, Australia.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the preferred embodiment, the invention is configured to work with the netpage networked computer system, a detailed overview of which follows. It will be appreciated that not every implementation will necessarily embody all or even most of the specific details and extensions discussed below in relation to the basic system. However, the system is described in its most complete form to reduce the need for external reference when attempting to understand the context in which the preferred embodiments and aspects of the present invention operate.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In brief summary, the preferred form of the netpage system employs a computer interface in the form of a mapped surface, that is, a physical surface which contains references to a map of the surface maintained in a computer system. The map references can be queried by an appropriate sensing device. Depending upon the specific implementation, the map references may be encoded visibly or invisibly, and defined in such a way that a local query on the mapped surface yields an unambiguous map reference both within the map and among different maps. The computer system can contain information about features on the mapped surface, and such information can be retrieved based on map references supplied by a sensing device used with the mapped surface. The information thus retrieved can take the form of actions which are initiated by the computer system on behalf of the operator in response to the operator's interaction with the surface features.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In its preferred form, the netpage system relies on the production of, and human interaction with, netpages. These are pages of text, graphics and images printed on ordinary paper, but which work like interactive web pages. Information is encoded on each page using ink which is substantially invisible to the unaided human eye. The ink, however, and thereby the coded data, can be sensed by an optically imaging pen and transmitted to the netpage system.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the preferred form, active buttons and hyperlinks on each page can be clicked with the pen to request information from the network or to signal preferences to a network server. In one embodiment, text written by hand on a netpage is automatically recognized and converted to computer text in the netpage system, allowing forms to be filled in. In other embodiments, signatures recorded on a netpage are automatically verified, allowing e-commerce transactions to be securely authorized.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a printed netpage <b>1</b> can represent a interactive form which can be filled in by the user both physically, on the printed page, and &#x201c;electronically&#x201d;, via communication between the pen and the netpage system. The example shows a &#x201c;Request&#x201d; form containing name and address fields and a submit button. The netpage consists of graphic data <b>2</b> printed using visible ink, and coded data <b>3</b> printed as a collection of tags <b>4</b> using invisible ink. The corresponding page description <b>5</b>, stored on the netpage network, describes the individual elements of the netpage. In particular it describes the type and spatial extent (zone) of each interactive element (i.e. text field or button in the example), to allow the netpage system to correctly interpret input via the netpage. The submit button <b>6</b>, for example, has a zone <b>7</b> which corresponds to the spatial extent of the corresponding graphic <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the netpage pen <b>101</b>, a preferred form of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> and described in more detail below, works in conjunction with a netpage printer <b>601</b>, an Internet-connected printing appliance for home, office or mobile use. The pen is wireless and communicates securely with the netpage printer via a short-range radio link <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The netpage printer <b>601</b>, a preferred form of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 13</figref> and described in more detail below, is able to deliver, periodically or on demand, personalized newspapers, magazines, catalogs, brochures and other publications, all printed at high quality as interactive netpages. Unlike a personal computer, the netpage printer is an appliance which can be, for example, wall-mounted adjacent to an area where the morning news is first consumed, such as in a user's kitchen, near a breakfast table, or near the household's point of departure for the day. It also comes in tabletop, desktop, portable and miniature versions.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Netpages printed at their point of consumption combine the ease-of-use of paper with the timeliness and interactivity of an interactive medium.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the netpage pen <b>101</b> interacts with the coded data on a printed netpage <b>1</b> and communicates, via a short-range radio link <b>9</b>, the interaction to a netpage printer. The printer <b>601</b> sends the interaction to the relevant netpage page server <b>10</b> for interpretation. In appropriate circumstances, the page server sends a corresponding message to application computer software running on a netpage application server <b>13</b>. The application server may in turn send a response which is printed on the originating printer. The netpage system is made considerably more convenient in the preferred embodiment by being used in conjunction with high-speed microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based inkjet (Memjet&#x2122;) printers. In the preferred form of this technology, relatively high-speed and high-quality printing is made more affordable to consumers. In its preferred form, a netpage publication has the physical characteristics of a traditional newsmagazine, such as a set of letter-size glossy pages printed in full color on both sides, bound together for easy navigation and comfortable handling.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The netpage printer exploits the growing availability of broadband Internet access. Cable service is available to 95% of households in the United States, and cable modem service offering broadband Internet access is already available to 20% of these. The netpage printer can also operate with slower connections, but with longer delivery times and lower image quality. Indeed, the netpage system can be enabled using existing consumer inkjet and laser printers, although the system will operate more slowly and will therefore be less acceptable from a consumer's point of view. In other embodiments, the netpage system is hosted on a private intranet. In still other embodiments, the netpage system is hosted on a single computer or computer-enabled device, such as a printer.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Netpage publication servers <b>14</b> on the netpage network are configured to deliver print-quality publications to netpage printers. Periodical publications are delivered automatically to subscribing netpage printers via pointcasting and multicasting Internet protocols. Personalized publications are filtered and formatted according to individual user profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A netpage printer can be configured to support any number of pens, and a pen can work with any number of netpage printers. In the preferred implementation, each netpage pen has a unique identifier. A household may have a collection of colored netpage pens, one assigned to each member of the family. This allows each user to maintain a distinct profile with respect to a netpage publication server or application server.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A netpage pen can also be registered with a netpage registration server <b>11</b> and linked to one or more payment card accounts. This allows e-commerce payments to be securely authorized using the netpage pen. The netpage registration server compares the signature captured by the netpage pen with a previously registered signature, allowing it to authenticate the user's identity to an e-commerce server. Other biometrics can also be used to verify identity. A version of the netpage pen includes fingerprint scanning, verified in a similar way by the netpage registration server.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Although a netpage printer may deliver periodicals such as the morning newspaper without user intervention, it can be configured never to deliver unsolicited junk mail. In its preferred form, it only delivers periodicals from subscribed or otherwise authorized sources. In this respect, the netpage printer is unlike a fax machine or e-mail account which is visible to any junk mailer who knows the telephone number or email address.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">1 Netpage System Architecture</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Each object model in the system is described using a Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram. A class diagram consists of a set of object classes connected by relationships, and two kinds of relationships are of interest here: associations and generalizations. An association represents some kind of relationship between objects, i.e. between instances of classes. A generalization relates actual classes, and can be understood in the following way: if a class is thought of as the set of all objects of that class, and class A is a generalization of class B, then B is simply a subset of A. The UML does not directly support second-order modelling&#x2014;i.e. classes of classes.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Each class is drawn as a rectangle labelled with the name of the class. It contains a list of the attributes of the class, separated from the name by a horizontal line, and a list of the operations of the class, separated from the attribute list by a horizontal line. In the class diagrams which follow, however, operations are never modelled.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">An association is drawn as a line joining two classes, optionally labelled at either end with the multiplicity of the association. The default multiplicity is one. An asterisk (*) indicates a multiplicity of &#x201c;many&#x201d;, i.e. zero or more. Each association is optionally labelled with its name, and is also optionally labelled at either end with the role of the corresponding class. An open diamond indicates an aggregation association (&#x201c;is-part-of&#x201d;), and is drawn at the aggregator end of the association line.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">A generalization relationship (&#x201c;is-a&#x201d;) is drawn as a solid line joining two classes, with an arrow (in the form of an open triangle) at the generalization end.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">When a class diagram is broken up into multiple diagrams, any class which is duplicated is shown with a dashed outline in all but the main diagram which defines it. It is shown with attributes only where it is defined.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">1.1 Netpages</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Netpages are the foundation on which a netpage network is built. They provide a paper-based user interface to published information and interactive services.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">A netpage consists of a printed page (or other surface region) invisibly tagged with references to an online description of the page. The online page description is maintained persistently by a netpage page server. The page description describes the visible layout and content of the page, including text, graphics and images. It also describes the input elements on the page, including buttons, hyperlinks, and input fields. A netpage allows markings made with a netpage pen on its surface to be simultaneously captured and processed by the netpage system.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Multiple netpages can share the same page description. However, to allow input through otherwise identical pages to be distinguished, each netpage is assigned a unique page identifier. This page ID has sufficient precision to distinguish between a very large number of netpages.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Each reference to the page description is encoded in a printed tag. The tag identifies the unique page on which it appears, and thereby indirectly identifies the page description. The tag also identifies its own position on the page. Characteristics of the tags are described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Tags are printed in infrared-absorptive ink on any substrate which is infrared-reflective, such as ordinary paper. Near-infrared wavelengths are invisible to the human eye but are easily sensed by a solid-state image sensor with an appropriate filter.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A tag is sensed by an area image sensor in the netpage pen, and the tag data is transmitted to the netpage system via the nearest netpage printer. The pen is wireless and communicates with the netpage printer via a short-range radio link. Tags are sufficiently small and densely arranged that the pen can reliably image at least one tag even on a single click on the page. It is important that the pen recognize the page ID and position on every interaction with the page, since the interaction is stateless. Tags are error-correctably encoded to make them partially tolerant to surface damage.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The netpage page server maintains a unique page instance for each printed netpage, allowing it to maintain a distinct set of user-supplied values for input fields in the page description for each printed netpage.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The relationship between the page description, the page instance, and the printed netpage is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The page instance is associated with both the netpage printer which printed it and, if known, the netpage user who requested it.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">1.2 Netpage Tags</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">1.2.1 Tag Data Content</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In a preferred form, each tag identifies the region in which it appears, and the location of that tag within the region. A tag may also contain flags which relate to the region as a whole or to the tag. One or more flag bits may, for example, signal a tag sensing device to provide feedback indicative of a function associated with the immediate area of the tag, without the sensing device having to refer to a description of the region. A netpage pen may, for example, illuminate an &#x201c;active area&#x201d; LED when in the zone of a hyperlink.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As will be more clearly explained below, in a preferred embodiment, each tag contains an easily recognized invariant structure which aids initial detection, and which assists in minimizing the effect of any warp induced by the surface or by the sensing process. The tags preferably tile the entire page, and are sufficiently small and densely arranged that the pen can reliably image at least one tag even on a single click on the page. It is important that the pen recognize the page ID and position on every interaction with the page, since the interaction is stateless.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In a preferred embodiment, the region to which a tag refers coincides with an entire page, and the region ID encoded in the tag is therefore synonymous with the page ID of the page on which the tag appears. In other embodiments, the region to which a tag refers can be an arbitrary subregion of a page or other surface. For example, it can coincide with the zone of an interactive element, in which case the region ID can directly identify the interactive element.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Each tag contains 120 bits of information, typically allocated as shown in Table 1. Assuming a maximum tag density of 64 per square inch, a 16-bit tag ID supports a region size of up to 1024 square inches. Larger regions can be mapped continuously without increasing the tag ID precision simply by using abutting regions and maps. The 100-bit region ID allows 2<sup>100 </sup>(&#x2dc;10<sup>30 </sup>or a million trillion) different regions to be uniquely identified.</p>
<p id="h-0029" num="0000">1.2.2 Tag Data Encoding</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The 120 bits of tag data are redundantly encoded using a (15, 5) Reed-Solomon code. This yields 360 encoded bits consisting of 6 codewords of 15 4-bit symbols each. The (15, 5) code allows up to 5 symbol errors to be corrected per codeword, i.e. it is tolerant of a symbol error rate of up to 33% per codeword.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Each 4-bit symbol is represented in a spatially coherent way in the tag, and the symbols of the six codewords are interleaved spatially within the tag. This ensures that a burst error (an error affecting multiple spatially adjacent bits) damages a minimum number of symbols overall and a minimum number of symbols in any one codeword, thus maximising the likelihood that the burst error can be fully corrected.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">1.2.3 Physical Tag Structure</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The physical representation of the tag, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, includes fixed target structures <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> and variable data areas <b>18</b>. The fixed target structures allow a sensing device such as the netpage pen to detect the tag and infer its three-dimensional orientation relative to the sensor. The data areas contain representations of the individual bits of the encoded tag data.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">To achieve proper tag reproduction, the tag is rendered at a resolution of 256&#xd7;256 dots. When printed at 1600 dots per inch this yields a tag with a diameter of about 4 mm. At this resolution the tag is designed to be surrounded by a &#x201c;quiet area&#x201d; of radius 16 dots. Since the quiet area is also contributed by adjacent tags, it only adds 16 dots to the effective diameter of the tag.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The tag includes six target structures. A detection ring <b>15</b> allows the sensing device to initially detect the tag. The ring is easy to detect because it is rotationally invariant and because a simple correction of its aspect ratio removes most of the effects of perspective distortion. An orientation axis <b>16</b> allows the sensing device to determine the approximate planar orientation of the tag due to the yaw of the sensor. The orientation axis is skewed to yield a unique orientation. Four perspective targets <b>17</b> allow the sensing device to infer an accurate two-dimensional perspective transform of the tag and hence an accurate three-dimensional position and orientation of the tag relative to the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">All target structures are redundantly large to improve their immunity to noise.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The overall tag shape is circular. This supports, amongst other things, optimal tag packing on an irregular triangular grid. In combination with the circular detection ring, this makes a circular arrangement of data bits within the tag optimal. To maximise its size, each data bit is represented by a radial wedge in the form of an area bounded by two radial lines and two concentric circular arcs. Each wedge has a minimum dimension of 8 dots at 1600 dpi and is designed so that its base (its inner arc), is at least equal to this minimum dimension. The height of the wedge in the radial direction is always equal to the minimum dimension. Each 4-bit data symbol is represented by an array of 2&#xd7;2 wedges.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The 15 4-bit data symbols of each of the six codewords are allocated to the four concentric symbol rings <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>d </i>in interleaved fashion. Symbols are allocated alternately in circular progression around the tag.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The interleaving is designed to maximise the average spatial distance between any two symbols of the same codeword.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In order to support &#x201c;single-click&#x201d; interaction with a tagged region via a sensing device, the sensing device must be able to see at least one entire tag in its field of view no matter where in the region or at what orientation it is positioned. The required diameter of the field of view of the sensing device is therefore a function of the size and spacing of the tags.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Assuming a circular tag shape, the minimum diameter of the sensor field of view is obtained when the tags are tiled on a equilateral triangular grid, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0031" num="0000">1.2.4 Tag Image Processing and Decoding</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The tag image processing and decoding performed by a sensing device such as the netpage pen is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. While a captured image is being acquired from the image sensor, the dynamic range of the image is determined (at <b>20</b>). The center of the range is then chosen as the binary threshold for the image <b>21</b>. The image is then thresholded and segmented into connected pixel regions (i.e. shapes <b>23</b>) (at <b>22</b>). Shapes which are too small to represent tag target structures are discarded. The size and centroid of each shape is also computed.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Binary shape moments <b>25</b> are then computed (at <b>24</b>) for each shape, and these provide the basis for subsequently locating target structures. Central shape moments are by their nature invariant of position, and can be easily made invariant of scale, aspect ratio and rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The ring target structure <b>15</b> is the first to be located (at <b>26</b>). A ring has the advantage of being very well behaved when perspective-distorted. Matching proceeds by aspect-normalizing and rotation-normalizing each shape's moments. Once its second-order moments are normalized the ring is easy to recognize even if the perspective distortion was significant. The ring's original aspect and rotation <b>27</b> together provide a useful approximation of the perspective transform.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The axis target structure <b>16</b> is the next to be located (at <b>28</b>). Matching proceeds by applying the ring's normalizations to each shape's moments, and rotation-normalizing the resulting moments. Once its second-order moments are normalized the axis target is easily recognized. Note that one third order moment is required to disambiguate the two possible orientations of the axis. The shape is deliberately skewed to one side to make this possible. Note also that it is only possible to rotation-normalize the axis target after it has had the ring's normalizations applied, since the perspective distortion can hide the axis target's axis. The axis target's original rotation provides a useful approximation of the tag's rotation due to pen yaw <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The four perspective target structures <b>17</b> are the last to be located (at <b>30</b>). Good estimates of their positions are computed based on their known spatial relationships to the ring and axis targets, the aspect and rotation of the ring, and the rotation of the axis. Matching proceeds by applying the ring's normalizations to each shape's moments. Once their second-order moments are normalized the circular perspective targets are easy to recognize, and the target closest to each estimated position is taken as a match. The original centroids of the four perspective targets are then taken to be the perspective-distorted corners <b>31</b> of a square of known size in tag space, and an eight-degree-of-freedom perspective transform <b>33</b> is inferred (at <b>32</b>) based on solving the well-understood equations relating the four tag-space and image-space point pairs (see Heckbert, P., Fundamentals of Texture Mapping and Image Warping, Masters Thesis, Dept. of EECS, U. of California at Berkeley, Technical Report No. UCB/CSD 89/516, June 1989, the contents of which are herein incorporated by cross-reference).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The inferred tag-space to image-space perspective transform is used to project (at <b>36</b>) each known data bit position in tag space into image space where the real-valued position is used to bilinearly interpolate (at <b>36</b>) the four relevant adjacent pixels in the input image. The previously computed image threshold <b>21</b> is used to threshold the result to produce the final bit value <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Once all 360 data bits <b>37</b> have been obtained in this way, each of the six 60-bit Reed-Solomon codewords is decoded (at <b>38</b>) to yield <b>20</b> decoded bits <b>39</b>, or <b>120</b> decoded bits in total. Note that the codeword symbols are sampled in codeword order, so that codewords are implicitly de-interleaved during the sampling process.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The ring target <b>15</b> is only sought in a subarea of the image whose relationship to the image guarantees that the ring, if found, is part of a complete tag. If a complete tag is not found and successfully decoded, then no pen position is recorded for the current frame. Given adequate processing power and ideally a non-minimal field of view <b>193</b>, an alternative strategy involves seeking another tag in the current image.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The obtained tag data indicates the identity of the region containing the tag and the position of the tag within the region. An accurate position <b>35</b> of the pen nib in the region, as well as the overall orientation <b>35</b> of the pen, is then inferred (at <b>34</b>) from the perspective transform <b>33</b> observed on the tag and the known spatial relationship between the pen's physical axis and the pen's optical axis.</p>
<p id="h-0032" num="0000">1.2.5 Tag Map</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Decoding a tag results in a region ID, a tag ID, and a tag-relative pen transform. Before the tag ID and the tag-relative pen location can be translated into an absolute location within the tagged region, the location of the tag within the region must be known. This is given by a tag map, a function which maps each tag ID in a tagged region to a corresponding location. The tag map class diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, as part of the netpage printer class diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">A tag map reflects the scheme used to tile the surface region with tags, and this can vary according to surface type. When multiple tagged regions share the same tiling scheme and the same tag numbering scheme, they can also share the same tag map.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The tag map for a region must be retrievable via the region ID. Thus, given a region ID, a tag ID and a pen transform, the tag map can be retrieved, the tag ID can be translated into an absolute tag location within the region, and the tag-relative pen location can be added to the tag location to yield an absolute pen location within the region.</p>
<p id="h-0033" num="0000">1.2.6 Tagging Schemes</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Two distinct surface coding schemes are of interest, both of which use the tag structure described earlier in this section. The preferred coding scheme uses &#x201c;location-indicating&#x201d; tags as already discussed. An alternative coding scheme uses object-indicating tags.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">A location-indicating tag contains a tag ID which, when translated through the tag map associated with the tagged region, yields a unique tag location within the region. The tag-relative location of the pen is added to this tag location to yield the location of the pen within the region. This in turn is used to determine the location of the pen relative to a user interface element in the page description associated with the region. Not only is the user interface element itself identified, but a location relative to the user interface element is identified. Location-indicating tags therefore trivially support the capture of an absolute pen path in the zone of a particular user interface element.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">An object-indicating tag contains a tag ID which directly identifies a user interface element in the page description associated with the region. All the tags in the zone of the user interface element identify the user interface element, making them all identical and therefore indistinguishable. Object-indicating tags do not, therefore, support the capture of an absolute pen path. They do, however, support the capture of a relative pen path. So long as the position sampling frequency exceeds twice the encountered tag frequency, the displacement from one sampled pen position to the next within a stroke can be unambiguously determined.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">With either tagging scheme, the tags function in cooperation with associated visual elements on the netpage as user interactive elements in that a user can interact with the printed page using an appropriate sensing device in order for tag data to be read by the sensing device and for an appropriate response to be generated in the netpage system.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">1.3 Document and Page Descriptions</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">A preferred embodiment of a document and page description class diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In the netpage system a document is described at three levels. At the most abstract level the document <b>836</b> has a hierarchical structure whose terminal elements <b>839</b> are associated with content objects <b>840</b> such as text objects, text style objects, image objects, etc. Once the document is printed on a printer with a particular page size and according to a particular user's scale factor preference, the document is paginated and otherwise formatted. Formatted terminal elements <b>835</b> will in some cases be associated with content objects which are different from those associated with their corresponding terminal elements, particularly where the content objects are style-related. Each printed instance of a document and page is also described separately, to allow input captured through a particular page instance <b>830</b> to be recorded separately from input captured through other instances of the same page description.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The presence of the most abstract document description on the page server allows a user to request a copy of a document without being forced to accept the source document's specific format. The user may be requesting a copy through a printer with a different page size, for example. Conversely, the presence of the formatted document description on the page server allows the page server to efficiently interpret user actions on a particular printed page.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">A formatted document <b>834</b> consists of a set of formatted page descriptions <b>5</b>, each of which consists of a set of formatted terminal elements <b>835</b>. Each formatted element has a spatial extent or zone <b>58</b> on the page. This defines the active area of input elements such as hyperlinks and input fields.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">A document instance <b>831</b> corresponds to a formatted document <b>834</b>. It consists of a set of page instances <b>830</b>, each of which corresponds to a page description <b>5</b> of the formatted document. Each page instance <b>830</b> describes a single unique printed netpage <b>1</b>, and records the page ID <b>50</b> of the netpage. A page instance is not part of a document instance if it represents a copy of a page requested in isolation.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">A page instance consists of a set of terminal element instances <b>832</b>. An element instance only exists if it records instance-specific information. Thus, a hyperlink instance exists for a hyperlink element because it records a transaction ID <b>55</b> which is specific to the page instance, and a field instance exists for a field element because it records input specific to the page instance. An element instance does not exist, however, for static elements such as textflows.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">A terminal element can be a static element <b>843</b>, a hyperlink element <b>844</b>, a field element <b>845</b> or a page server command element <b>846</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. A static element <b>843</b> can be a style element <b>847</b> with an associated style object <b>854</b>, a textflow element <b>848</b> with an associated styled text object <b>855</b>, an image element <b>849</b> with an associated image element <b>856</b>, a graphic element <b>850</b> with an associated graphic object <b>857</b>, a video clip element <b>851</b> with an associated video clip object <b>858</b>, an audio clip element <b>852</b> with an associated audio clip object <b>859</b>, or a script element <b>853</b> with an associated script object <b>860</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">A page instance has a background field <b>833</b> which is used to record any digital ink captured on the page which does not apply to a specific input element.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In the preferred form of the invention, a tag map <b>811</b> is associated with each page instance to allow tags on the page to be translated into locations on the page.</p>
<p id="h-0035" num="0000">1.4 The Netpage Network</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In a preferred embodiment, a netpage network consists of a distributed set of netpage page servers <b>10</b>, netpage registration servers <b>11</b>, netpage ID servers <b>12</b>, netpage application servers <b>13</b>, netpage publication servers <b>14</b>, and netpage printers <b>601</b> connected via a network <b>19</b> such as the Internet, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The netpage registration server <b>11</b> is a server which records relationships between users, pens, printers, applications and publications, and thereby authorizes various network activities. It authenticates users and acts as a signing proxy on behalf of authenticated users in application transactions. It also provides handwriting recognition services. As described above, a netpage page server <b>10</b> maintains persistent information about page descriptions and page instances. The netpage network includes any number of page servers, each handling a subset of page instances. Since a page server also maintains user input values for each page instance, clients such as netpage printers send netpage input directly to the appropriate page server. The page server interprets any such input relative to the description of the corresponding page.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">A netpage ID server <b>12</b> allocates document IDs <b>51</b> on demand, and provides load-balancing of page servers via its ID allocation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">A netpage printer uses the Internet Distributed Name System (DNS), or similar, to resolve a netpage page ID <b>50</b> into the network address of the netpage page server handling the corresponding page instance.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">A netpage application server <b>13</b> is a server which hosts interactive netpage applications. A netpage publication server <b>14</b> is an application server which publishes netpage documents to netpage printers. They are described in detail in Section 2.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Netpage servers can be hosted on a variety of network server platforms from manufacturers such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun. Multiple netpage servers can run concurrently on a single host, and a single server can be distributed over a number of hosts.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Some or all of the functionality provided by netpage servers, and in particular the functionality provided by the ID server and the page server, can also be provided directly in a netpage appliance such as a netpage printer, in a computer workstation, or on a local network.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">1.5 The Netpage Printer</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The netpage printer <b>601</b> is an appliance which is registered with the netpage system and prints netpage documents on demand and via subscription. Each printer has a unique printer ID <b>62</b>, and is connected to the netpage network via a network such as the Internet, ideally via a broadband connection.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Apart from identity and security settings in non-volatile memory, the netpage printer contains no persistent storage. As far as a user is concerned, &#x201c;the network is the computer&#x201d;. Netpages function interactively across space and time with the help of the distributed netpage page servers <b>10</b>, independently of particular netpage printers.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The netpage printer receives subscribed netpage documents from netpage publication servers <b>14</b>. Each document is distributed in two parts: the page layouts, and the actual text and image objects which populate the pages. Because of personalization, page layouts are typically specific to a particular subscriber and so are pointcast to the subscriber's printer via the appropriate page server. Text and image objects, on the other hand, are typically shared with other subscribers, and so are multicast to all subscribers' printers and the appropriate page servers.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The netpage publication server optimizes the segmentation of document content into pointcasts and multicasts. After receiving the pointcast of a document's page layouts, the printer knows which multicasts, if any, to listen to.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Once the printer has received the complete page layouts and objects that define the document to be printed, it can print the document.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The printer rasterizes and prints odd and even pages simultaneously on both sides of the sheet. It contains duplexed print engine controllers <b>760</b> and print engines utilizing Memjet&#x2122; printheads <b>350</b> for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The printing process consists of two decoupled stages: rasterization of page descriptions, and expansion and printing of page images. The raster image processor (RIP) consists of one or more standard DSPs <b>757</b> running in parallel. The duplexed print engine controllers consist of custom processors which expand, dither and print page images in real time, synchronized with the operation of the printheads in the print engines.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Printers not enabled for IR printing have the option to print tags using IR-absorptive black ink, although this restricts tags to otherwise empty areas of the page. Although such pages have more limited functionality than IR-printed pages, they are still classed as netpages.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">A normal netpage printer prints netpages on sheets of paper. More specialised netpage printers may print onto more specialised surfaces, such as globes. Each printer supports at least one surface type, and supports at least one tag tiling scheme, and hence tag map, for each surface type. The tag map <b>811</b> which describes the tag tiling scheme actually used to print a document becomes associated with that document so that the document's tags can be correctly interpreted.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the netpage printer class diagram, reflecting printer-related information maintained by a registration server <b>11</b> on the netpage network.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">A preferred embodiment of the netpage printer is described in greater detail in Section 6 below, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0037" num="0000">1.5.1 Memjet&#x2122; Printheads</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The netpage system can operate using printers made with a wide range of digital printing technologies, including thermal inkjet, piezoelectric inkjet, laser electrophotographic, and others. However, for wide consumer acceptance, it is desirable that a netpage printer have the following characteristics:</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">photographic quality color printing</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">high quality text printing</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">high reliability</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">low printer cost</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">low ink cost</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">low paper cost</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">simple operation</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">nearly silent printing</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">high printing speed</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">simultaneous double sided printing</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">compact form factor</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">low power consumption</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">No commercially available printing technology has all of these characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">To enable to production of printers with these characteristics, the present applicant has invented a new print technology, referred to as Memjet&#x2122; technology. Memjet&#x2122; is a drop-on-demand inkjet technology that incorporates pagewidth printheads fabricated using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a single printing element <b>300</b> of a Memjet&#x2122; printhead. The netpage wallprinter incorporates 168960 printing elements <b>300</b> to form a 1600 dpi pagewidth duplex printer. This printer simultaneously prints cyan, magenta, yellow, black, and infrared inks as well as paper conditioner and ink fixative.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The printing element <b>300</b> is approximately 110 microns long by 32 microns wide. Arrays of these printing elements are formed on a silicon substrate <b>301</b> that incorporates CMOS logic, data transfer, timing, and drive circuits (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Major elements of the printing element <b>300</b> are the nozzle <b>302</b>, the nozzle rim <b>303</b>, the nozzle chamber <b>304</b>, the fluidic seal <b>305</b>, the ink channel rim <b>306</b>, the lever arm <b>307</b>, the active actuator beam pair <b>308</b>, the passive actuator beam pair <b>309</b>, the active actuator anchor <b>310</b>, the passive actuator anchor <b>311</b>, and the ink inlet <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The active actuator beam pair <b>308</b> is mechanically joined to the passive actuator beam pair <b>309</b> at the join <b>319</b>. Both beams pairs are anchored at their respective anchor points <b>310</b> and <b>311</b>. The combination of elements <b>308</b>, <b>309</b>, <b>310</b>, <b>311</b>, and <b>319</b> form a cantilevered electrothermal bend actuator <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a small part of an array of printing elements <b>300</b>, including a cross section <b>315</b> of a printing element <b>300</b>. The cross section <b>315</b> is shown without ink, to clearly show the ink inlet <b>312</b> that passes through the silicon wafer <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>19</b>(<i>b</i>) and <b>19</b>(<i>c</i>) show the operating cycle of a Memjet&#x2122; printing element <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the quiescent position of the ink meniscus <b>316</b> prior to printing an ink droplet. Ink is retained in the nozzle chamber by surface tension at the ink meniscus <b>316</b> and at the fluidic seal <b>305</b> formed between the nozzle chamber <b>304</b> and the ink channel rim <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">While printing, the printhead CMOS circuitry distributes data from the print engine controller to the correct printing element, latches the data, and buffers the data to drive the electrodes <b>318</b> of the active actuator beam pair <b>308</b>. This causes an electrical current to pass through the beam pair <b>308</b> for about one microsecond, resulting in Joule heating. The temperature increase resulting from Joule heating causes the beam pair <b>308</b> to expand. As the passive actuator beam pair <b>309</b> is not heated, it does not expand, resulting in a stress difference between the two beam pairs. This stress difference is partially resolved by the cantilevered end of the electrothermal bend actuator <b>320</b> bending towards the substrate <b>301</b>. The lever arm <b>307</b> transmits this movement to the nozzle chamber <b>304</b>. The nozzle chamber <b>304</b> moves about two microns to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>b</i>). This increases the ink pressure, forcing ink <b>321</b> out of the nozzle <b>302</b>, and causing the ink meniscus <b>316</b> to bulge. The nozzle rim <b>303</b> prevents the ink meniscus <b>316</b> from spreading across the surface of the nozzle chamber <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">As the temperature of the beam pairs <b>308</b> and <b>309</b> equalizes, the actuator <b>320</b> returns to its original position. This aids in the break-off of the ink droplet <b>317</b> from the ink <b>321</b> in the nozzle chamber, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref><i>c</i>). The nozzle chamber is refilled by the action of the surface tension at the meniscus <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows a segment of a printhead <b>350</b>. In a netpage printer, the length of the printhead is the full width of the paper (typically 210 mm) in the direction <b>351</b>. The segment shown is 0.4 mm long (about 0.2% of a complete printhead). When printing, the paper is moved past the fixed printhead in the direction <b>352</b>. The printhead has 6 rows of interdigitated printing elements <b>300</b>, printing the six colors or types of ink supplied by the ink inlets <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">To protect the fragile surface of the printhead during operation, a nozzle guard wafer <b>330</b> is attached to the printhead substrate <b>301</b>. For each nozzle <b>302</b> there is a corresponding nozzle guard hole <b>331</b> through which the ink droplets are fired. To prevent the nozzle guard holes <b>331</b> from becoming blocked by paper fibers or other debris, filtered air is pumped through the air inlets <b>332</b> and out of the nozzle guard holes during printing. To prevent ink <b>321</b> from drying, the nozzle guard is sealed while the printer is idle.</p>
<p id="h-0038" num="0000">1.6 The Netpage Pen</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The active sensing device of the netpage system is typically a pen <b>101</b>, which, using its embedded controller <b>134</b>, is able to capture and decode IR position tags from a page via an image sensor. The image sensor is a solid-state device provided with an appropriate filter to permit sensing at only near-infrared wavelengths. As described in more detail below, the system is able to sense when the nib is in contact with the surface, and the pen is able to sense tags at a sufficient rate to capture human handwriting (i.e. at 200 dpi or greater and 100 Hz or faster). Information captured by the pen is encrypted and wirelessly transmitted to the printer (or base station), the printer or base station interpreting the data with respect to the (known) page structure.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The preferred embodiment of the netpage pen operates both as a normal marking ink pen and as a non-marking stylus. The marking aspect, however, is not necessary for using the netpage system as a browsing system, such as when it is used as an Internet interface. Each netpage pen is registered with the netpage system and has a unique pen ID <b>61</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows the netpage pen class diagram, reflecting pen-related information maintained by a registration server <b>11</b> on the netpage network.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">When either nib is in contact with a netpage, the pen determines its position and orientation relative to the page. The nib is attached to a force sensor, and the force on the nib is interpreted relative to a threshold to indicate whether the pen is &#x201c;up&#x201d; or &#x201c;down&#x201d;. This allows a interactive element on the page to be &#x2018;clicked&#x2019; by pressing with the pen nib, in order to request, say, information from a network. Furthermore, the force is captured as a continuous value to allow, say, the full dynamics of a signature to be verified.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">The pen determines the position and orientation of its nib on the netpage by imaging, in the infrared spectrum, an area <b>193</b> of the page in the vicinity of the nib. It decodes the nearest tag and computes the position of the nib relative to the tag from the observed perspective distortion on the imaged tag and the known geometry of the pen optics. Although the position resolution of the tag may be low, because the tag density on the page is inversely proportional to the tag size, the adjusted position resolution is quite high, exceeding the minimum resolution required for accurate handwriting recognition.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Pen actions relative to a netpage are captured as a series of strokes. A stroke consists of a sequence of time-stamped pen positions on the page, initiated by a pen-down event and completed by the subsequent pen-up event. A stroke is also tagged with the page ID <b>50</b> of the netpage whenever the page ID changes, which, under normal circumstances, is at the commencement of the stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Each netpage pen has a current selection <b>826</b> associated with it, allowing the user to perform copy and paste operations etc. The selection is timestamped to allow the system to discard it after a defined time period. The current selection describes a region of a page instance. It consists of the most recent digital ink stroke captured through the pen relative to the background area of the page. It is interpreted in an application-specific manner once it is submitted to an application via a selection hyperlink activation.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Each pen has a current nib <b>824</b>. This is the nib last notified by the pen to the system. In the case of the default netpage pen described above, either the marking black ink nib or the non-marking stylus nib is current. Each pen also has a current nib style <b>825</b>. This is the nib style last associated with the pen by an application, e.g. in response to the user selecting a color from a palette. The default nib style is the nib style associated with the current nib. Strokes captured through a pen are tagged with the current nib style. When the strokes are subsequently reproduced, they are reproduced in the nib style with which they are tagged.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Whenever the pen is within range of a printer with which it can communicate, the pen slowly flashes its &#x201c;online&#x201d; LED. When the pen fails to decode a stroke relative to the page, it momentarily activates its &#x201c;error&#x201d; LED. When the pen succeeds in decoding a stroke relative to the page, it momentarily activates its &#x201c;ok&#x201d; LED.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">A sequence of captured strokes is referred to as digital ink. Digital ink forms the basis for the digital exchange of drawings and handwriting, for online recognition of handwriting, and for online verification of signatures.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The pen is wireless and transmits digital ink to the netpage printer via a short-range radio link. The transmitted digital ink is encrypted for privacy and security and packetized for efficient transmission, but is always flushed on a pen-up event to ensure timely handling in the printer.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">When the pen is out-of-range of a printer it buffers digital ink in internal memory, which has a capacity of over ten minutes of continuous handwriting. When the pen is once again within range of a printer, it transfers any buffered digital ink.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">A pen can be registered with any number of printers, but because all state data resides in netpages both on paper and on the network, it is largely immaterial which printer a pen is communicating with at any particular time.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">A preferred embodiment of the pen is described in greater detail in Section 6 below, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0039" num="0000">1.7 Netpage Interaction</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The netpage printer <b>601</b> receives data relating to a stroke from the pen <b>101</b> when the pen is used to interact with a netpage <b>1</b>. The coded data <b>3</b> of the tags <b>4</b> is read by the pen when it is used to execute a movement, such as a stroke. The data allows the identity of the particular page and associated interactive element to be determined and an indication of the relative positioning of the pen relative to the page to be obtained. The indicating data is transmitted to the printer, where it resolves, via the DNS, the page ID <b>50</b> of the stroke into the network address of the netpage page server <b>10</b> which maintains the corresponding page instance <b>830</b>. It then transmits the stroke to the page server. If the page was recently identified in an earlier stroke, then the printer may already have the address of the relevant page server in its cache. Each netpage consists of a compact page layout maintained persistently by a netpage page server (see below). The page layout refers to objects such as images, fonts and pieces of text, typically stored elsewhere on the netpage network.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">When the page server receives the stroke from the pen, it retrieves the page description to which the stroke applies, and determines which element of the page description the stroke intersects. It is then able to interpret the stroke in the context of the type of the relevant element.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">A &#x201c;click&#x201d; is a stroke where the distance and time between the pen down position and the subsequent pen up position are both less than some small maximum. An object which is activated by a click typically requires a click to be activated, and accordingly, a longer stroke is ignored. The failure of a pen action, such as a &#x201c;sloppy&#x201d; click, to register is indicated by the lack of response from the pen's &#x201c;ok&#x201d; LED.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">There are two kinds of input elements in a netpage page description: hyperlinks and form fields. Input through a form field can also trigger the activation of an associated hyperlink.</p>
<p id="h-0040" num="0000">1.7.1 Hyperlinks</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">A hyperlink is a means of sending a message to a remote application, and typically elicits a printed response in the netpage system.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">A hyperlink element <b>844</b> identifies the application <b>71</b> which handles activation of the hyperlink, a link ID <b>51</b> which identifies the hyperlink to the application, an &#x201c;alias required&#x201d; flag which asks the system to include the user's application alias ID <b>65</b> in the hyperlink activation, and a description which is used when the hyperlink is recorded as a favorite or appears in the user's history. The hyperlink element class diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">When a hyperlink is activated, the page server sends a request to an application somewhere on the network. The application is identified by an application ID <b>64</b>, and the application Id is resolved in the normal way via the DNS, There are three types of hyperlink: general hyperlinks <b>863</b>, form hyperlinks <b>865</b>, and selection hyperlinks <b>864</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. A general hyperlink can implement a request for a linked document, or may simple signal a preference to a server. A form hyperlink submits the corresponding form to the application. A selection hyperlink submits the current selection to the application. It the current selection contains a single-word piece of test, for example, the application may return a single-page document giving the word's meaning within the context in which it appears, or a translation into a different language. Each hyperlink type is characterized by what information is submitted to the application.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The corresponding hyperlink instance <b>862</b> records a transaction ID <b>55</b> which can be specific to the page instance on which the hyperlink instance appears. The transaction ID can identify user-specific data to the application, for example a &#x201c;shopping cart&#x201d; of pending purchases maintained by a purchasing application of behalf of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The system includes the pen's current selection <b>826</b> in a selection hyperlink activation. The system included the content of the associated form instance <b>868</b> in a form hyperlink activation, although if the hyperlink had its &#x201c;submit delta&#x201d; attribute set, only input since the last form submitting is included. The system includes and effective return path in all hyperlink activations.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">A hyperlinked group <b>866</b> is a group element <b>838</b> which has an associated hyperlink, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. When input occurs through any field element in the group, the hyperlink <b>844</b> associated with the group is activated. A hyperlinked group can be used to associate hyperlink behavior with a field such as a checkbox. It can also be used, in conjunction with the &#x201c;submit delta&#x201d; attribute of a form hyperlink, to provide continuous input to an application. It can therefore be used to support a &#x201c;blackboard&#x201d; interaction model, i.e. where input is captured and therefore shared as soon as it occurs.</p>
<p id="h-0041" num="0000">1.7.2 Forms</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">A form defines a collection of related input fields used to capture a related set of inputs through a printed netpage. A form allows a user to submit one or more parameters to an application software program running on a server.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">A form <b>867</b> is a group element <b>838</b> in the document hierarchy. It ultimately contains a set of terminal field elements <b>839</b>. A form instance <b>868</b> represents a printed instance of a form. It consists of a set of field instances <b>870</b> which correspond to the field elements <b>845</b> of the form. Each field instance has an associated value <b>871</b>, whose type depends on the type of the corresponding field element. Each field value records input through a particular printed form instance, i.e. through one or more printed netpages. The form class diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Each form instance has a status <b>872</b> which indicates whether the form is active, frozen, submitted, void or expired. A form is active when first printed. A form becomes frozen once it is signed. A form becomes submitted once one of its submission hyperlinks has been activated, unless the hyperlink has its &#x201c;submit delta&#x201d; attribute set. A form becomes void when the user invokes a void form, reset form or duplicate form page command. A form expires when the time the form has been active exceeds the form's specified lifetime. While the form is active, form input is allowed. Input through a form which is not active is instead captured in the background field <b>833</b> of the relevant page instance. When the form is active or frozen, form submission is allowed. Any attempt to submit a form when the form is not active or frozen is rejected, and instead elicits an form status report.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Each form instance is associated (at <b>59</b>) with any form instances derived from it, thus providing a version history. This allows all but the latest version of a form in a particular time period to be excluded from a search.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">All input is captured as digital ink. Digital ink <b>873</b> consists of a set of timestamped stroke groups <b>874</b>, each of which consists of a set of styled strokes <b>875</b>. Each stroke consists of a set of timestamped pen positions <b>876</b>, each of which also includes pen orientation and nib force. The digital ink class diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">A field element <b>845</b> can be a checkbox field <b>877</b>, a text field <b>878</b>, a drawing field <b>879</b>, or a signature field <b>880</b>. The field element class diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. Any digital ink captured in a field's zone <b>58</b> is assigned to the field.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">A checkbox field has an associated boolean value <b>881</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. Any mark (a tick, a cross, a stroke, a fill zigzag, etc.) captured in a checkbox field's zone causes a true value to be assigned to the field's value.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">A text field has an associated text value <b>882</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. Any digital ink captured in a text field's zone is automatically converted to text via online handwriting recognition, and the text is assigned to the field's value. Online handwriting recognition is well-understood (see, for example, Tappert, C., C. Y. Suen and T. Wakahara, &#x201c;The State of the Art in On-Line Handwriting Recognition&#x201d;, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 12, No. 8, August 1990, the contents of which are herein incorporated by cross-reference).</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">A signature field has an associated digital signature value <b>883</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Any digital ink captured in a signature field's zone is automatically verified with respect to the identity of the owner of the pen, and a digital signature of the content of the form of which the field is part is generated and assigned to the field's value. The digital signature is generated using the pen user's private signature key specific to the application which owns the form. Online signature verification is well-understood (see, for example, Plamondon, R. and G. Lorette, &#x201c;Automatic Signature Verification and Writer Identification&#x2014;The State of the Art&#x201d;, Pattern Recognition, Vol. 22, No. 2, 1989, the contents of which are herein incorporated by cross-reference).</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">A field element is hidden if its &#x201c;hidden&#x201d; attribute is set. A hidden field element does not have an input zone on a page and does not accept input. It can have an associated field value which is included in the form data when the form containing the field is submitted.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">&#x201c;Editing&#x201d; commands, such as strike-throughs indicating deletion, can also be recognized in form fields.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Because the handwriting recognition algorithm works &#x201c;online&#x201d; (i.e. with access to the dynamics of the pen movement), rather than &#x201c;offline&#x201d; (i.e. with access only to a bitmap of pen markings), it can recognize run-on discretely-written characters with relatively high accuracy, without a writer-dependent training phase. A writer-dependent model of handwriting is automatically generated over time, however, and can be generated up-front if necessary,</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Digital ink, as already stated, consists of a sequence of strokes. Any stroke which starts in a particular element's zone is appended to that element's digital ink stream, ready for interpretation. Any stroke not appended to an object's digital ink stream is appended to the background field's digital ink stream.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Digital ink captured in the background field is interpreted as a selection gesture. Circumscription of one or more objects is generally interpreted as a selection of the circumscribed objects, although the actual interpretation is application-specific.</p>

<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The system maintains a current selection for each pen. The selection consists simply of the most recent stroke captured in the background field. The selection is cleared after an inactivity timeout to ensure predictable behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">The raw digital ink captured in every field is retained on the netpage page server and is optionally transmitted with the form data when the form is submitted to the application. This allows the application to interrogate the raw digital ink should it suspect the original conversion, such as the conversion of handwritten text. This can, for example, involve human intervention at the application level for forms which fail certain application-specific consistency checks. As an extension to this, the entire background area of a form can be designated as a drawing field. The application can then decide, on the basis of the presence of digital ink outside the explicit fields of the form, to route the form to a human operator, on the assumption that the user may have indicated amendments to the filled-in fields outside of those fields.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> shows a flowchart of the process of handling pen input relative to a netpage. The process consists of receiving (at <b>884</b>) a stroke from the pen; identifying (at <b>885</b>) the page instance <b>830</b> to which the page ID <b>50</b> in the stroke refers; retrieving (at <b>886</b>) the page description <b>5</b>; identifying (at <b>887</b>) a formatted element <b>839</b> whose zone <b>58</b> the stroke intersects; determining (at <b>888</b>) whether the formatted element corresponds to a field element, and if so appending (at <b>892</b>) the received stroke to the digital ink of the field value <b>871</b>, interpreting (at <b>893</b>) the accumulated digital ink of the field, and determining (at <b>894</b>) whether the field is part of a hyperlinked group <b>866</b> and if so activating (at <b>895</b>) the associated hyperlink; alternatively determining (at <b>889</b>) whether the formatted element corresponds to a hyperlink element and if so activating (at <b>895</b>) the corresponding hyperlink; alternatively, in the absence of an input field or hyperlink, appending (at <b>890</b>) the received stroke to the digital ink of the background field <b>833</b>; and copying (at <b>891</b>) the received stroke to the current selection <b>826</b> of the current pen, as maintained by the registration server.</p>

The process consists of determining (at <b>896</b>) whether the field is a checkbox and (at <b>897</b>) whether the digital ink represents a checkmark, and if so assigning (at <b>898</b>) a true value to the field value; alternatively determining (at <b>899</b>) whether the field is a text field and if so converting (at <b>900</b>) the digital ink to computer text, with the help of the appropriate registration server, and assigning (at <b>901</b>) the converted computer text to the field value; alternatively determining (at <b>902</b>) whether the field is a signature field and if so verifying (at <b>903</b>) the digital ink as the signature of the pen's owner, with the help of the appropriate registration server, creating (at <b>904</b>) a digital signature of the contents of the corresponding form, also with the help of the registration server and using the pen owner's private signature key relating to the corresponding application, and assigning (at <b>905</b>) the digital signature to the field value.</p>
<p id="h-0042" num="0000">1.7.3 Page Server Commands</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">A page server command is a command which is handled locally by the page server. It operates directly on form, page and document instances.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">A page server command <b>907</b> can be a void form command <b>908</b>, a duplicate form command <b>909</b>, a reset form command <b>910</b>, a get form status command <b>911</b>, a duplicate page command <b>912</b>, a reset page command <b>913</b>, a get page status command <b>914</b>, a duplicate document command <b>915</b>, a reset document command <b>916</b>, or a get document status command <b>917</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">A void form command voids the corresponding form instance. A duplicate form command voids the corresponding form instance and then produces an active printed copy of the current form instance with field values preserved. The copy contains the same hyperlink transaction IDs as the original, and so is indistinguishable from the original to an application. A reset form command voids the corresponding form instance and then produces an active printed copy of the form instance with field values discarded. A get form status command produces a printed report on the status of the corresponding form instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the form status of the form instance.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Since a form hyperlink instance contains a transaction ID, the application has to be involved in producing a new form instance. A button requesting a new form instance is therefore typically implemented as a hyperlink.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">A duplicate page command produces a printed copy of the corresponding page instance with the background field value preserved. If the page contains a form or is part of a form, then the duplicate page command is interpreted as a duplicate form command. A reset page command produces a printed copy of the corresponding page instance with the background field value discarded. If the page contains a form or is part of a form, then the reset page command is interpreted as a reset form command. A get page status command produces a printed report on the status of the corresponding page instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the status of any forms it contains or is part of.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The netpage logo which appears on every netpage is usually associated with a duplicate page element.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">When a page instance is duplicated with field values preserved, field values are printed in their native form, i.e. a checkmark appears as a standard checkmark graphic, and text appears as typeset text. Only drawings and signatures appear in their original form, with a signature accompanied by a standard graphic indicating successful signature verification.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">A duplicate document command produces a printed copy of the corresponding document instance with background field values preserved. If the document contains any forms, then the duplicate document command duplicates the forms in the same way a duplicate form command does. A reset document command produces a printed copy of the corresponding document instance with background field values discarded. If the document contains any forms, then the reset document command resets the forms in the same way a reset form command does. A get document status command produces a printed report on the status of the corresponding document instance, including who published it, when it was printed, for whom it was printed, and the status of any forms it contains.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">If the page server command's &#x201c;on selected&#x201d; attribute is set, then the command operates on the page identified by the pen's current selection rather than on the page containing the command. This allows a menu of page server commands to be printed. If the target page doesn't contain a page server command element for the designated page server command, then the command is ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">An application can provide application-specific handling by embedding the relevant page server command element in a hyperlinked group. The page server activates the hyperlink associated with the hyperlinked group rather than executing the page server command.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">A page server command element is hidden if its &#x201c;hidden&#x201d; attribute is set. A hidden command element does not have an input zone on a page and so cannot be activated directly by a user. It can, however, be activated via a page server command embedded in a different page, if that page server command has its &#x201c;on selected&#x201d; attribute set.</p>
<p id="h-0043" num="0000">1.8 Standard Features of Netpages</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">In the preferred form, each netpage is printed with the netpage logo at the bottom to indicate that it is a netpage and therefore has interactive properties. The logo also acts as a copy button. In most cases pressing the logo produces a copy of the page. In the case of a form, the button produces a copy of the entire form. And in the case of a secure document, such as a ticket or coupon, the button elicits an explanatory note or advertising page.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">The default single-page copy function is handled directly by the relevant netpage page server. Special copy functions are handled by linking the logo button to an application.</p>
<p id="h-0044" num="0000">1.9 User Help System</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">In a preferred embodiment, the netpage printer has a single button labelled &#x201c;Help&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">When pressed it elicits a single page of information, including:</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">status of printer connection</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">status of printer consumables</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">top-level help menu</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">document function menu</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">top-level netpage network directory</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">The help menu provides a hierarchical manual on how to use the netpage system.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">The document function menu includes the following functions:</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">print a copy of a document</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">print a clean copy of a form</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">print the status of a document</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">A document function is initiated by simply pressing the button and then touching any page of the document. The status of a document indicates who published it and when, to whom it was delivered, and to whom and when it was subsequently submitted as a form.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">The netpage network directory allows the user to navigate the hierarchy of publications and services on the network. As an alternative, the user can call the netpage network &#x201c;900&#x201d; number &#x201c;yellow pages&#x201d; and speak to a human operator. The operator can locate the desired document and route it to the user's printer. Depending on the document type, the publisher or the user pays the small &#x201c;yellow pages&#x201d; service fee.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">The help page is obviously unavailable if the printer is unable to print. In this case the &#x201c;error&#x201d; light is lit and the user can request remote diagnosis over the network.</p>
<p id="h-0045" num="0000">2 Personalized Publication Model</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">In the following description, news is used as a canonical publication example to illustrate personalization mechanisms in the netpage system. Although news is often used in the limited sense of newspaper and newsmagazine news, the intended scope in the present context is wider.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">In the netpage system, the editorial content and the advertising content of a news publication are personalized using different mechanisms. The editorial content is personalized according to the reader's explicitly stated and implicitly captured interest profile. The advertising content is personalized according to the reader's locality and demographic.</p>
<p id="h-0046" num="0000">2.1 Editorial Personalization</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">A subscriber can draw on two kinds of news sources: those that deliver news publications, and those that deliver news streams. While news publications are aggregated and edited by the publisher, news streams are aggregated either by a news publisher or by a specialized news aggregator. News publications typically correspond to traditional newspapers and newsmagazines, while news streams can be many and varied: a &#x201c;raw&#x201d; news feed from a news service, a cartoon strip, a freelance writer's column, a friend's bulletin board, or the reader's own e-mail.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">The netpage publication server supports the publication of edited news publications as well as the aggregation of multiple news streams. By handling the aggregation and hence the formatting of news streams selected directly by the reader, the server is able to place advertising on pages over which it otherwise has no editorial control.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">The subscriber builds a daily newspaper by selecting one or more contributing news publications, and creating a personalized version of each. The resulting daily editions are printed and bound together into a single newspaper. The various members of a household typically express their different interests and tastes by selecting different daily publications and then customizing them.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">For each publication, the reader optionally selects specific sections. Some sections appear daily, while others appear weekly. The daily sections available from The New York Times online, for example, include &#x201c;Page One Plus&#x201d;, &#x201c;National&#x201d;, &#x201c;International&#x201d;, &#x201c;Opinion&#x201d;, &#x201c;Business&#x201d;, &#x201c;Arts/Living&#x201d;, &#x201c;Technology&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Sports&#x201d;. The set of available sections is specific to a publication, as is the default subset.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">The reader can extend the daily newspaper by creating custom sections, each one drawing on any number of news streams. Custom sections might be created for e-mail and friends' announcements (&#x201c;Personal&#x201d;), or for monitoring news feeds for specific topics (&#x201c;Alerts&#x201d; or &#x201c;Clippings&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">For each section, the reader optionally specifies its size, either qualitatively (e.g. short, medium, or long), or numerically (i.e. as a limit on its number of pages), and the desired proportion of advertising, either qualitatively (e.g. high, normal, low, none), or numerically (i.e. as a percentage).</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">The reader also optionally expresses a preference for a large number of shorter articles or a small number of longer articles. Each article is ideally written (or edited) in both short and long forms to support this preference.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">An article may also be written (or edited) in different versions to match the expected sophistication of the reader, for example to provide children's and adults' versions. The appropriate version is selected according to the reader's age. The reader can specify a &#x201c;reading age&#x201d; which takes precedence over their biological age.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">The articles which make up each section are selected and prioritized by the editors, and each is assigned a useful lifetime. By default they are delivered to all relevant subscribers, in priority order, subject to space constraints in the subscribers' editions.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">In sections where it is appropriate, the reader may optionally enable collaborative filtering. This is then applied to articles which have a sufficiently long lifetime. Each article which qualifies for collaborative filtering is printed with rating buttons at the end of the article. The buttons can provide an easy choice (e.g. &#x201c;liked&#x201d; and &#x201c;disliked&#x2019;), making it more likely that readers will bother to rate the article.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Articles with high priorities and short lifetimes are therefore effectively considered essential reading by the editors and are delivered to most relevant subscribers.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">The reader optionally specifies a serendipity factor, either qualitatively (e.g. do or don't surprise me), or numerically. A high serendipity factor lowers the threshold used for matching during collaborative filtering. A high factor makes it more likely that the corresponding section will be filled to the reader's specified capacity. A different serendipity factor can be specified for different days of the week.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">The reader also optionally specifies topics of particular interest within a section, and this modifies the priorities assigned by the editors.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">The speed of the reader's Internet connection affects the quality at which images can be delivered. The reader optionally specifies a preference for fewer images or smaller images or both. If the number or size of images is not reduced, then images may be delivered at lower quality (i.e. at lower resolution or with greater compression).</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">At a global level, the reader specifies how quantities, dates, times and monetary values are localized. This involves specifying whether units are imperial or metric, a local timezone and time format, and a local currency, and whether the localization consist of in situ translation or annotation. These preferences are derived from the reader's locality by default.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">To reduce reading difficulties caused by poor eyesight, the reader optionally specifies a global preference for a larger presentation. Both text and images are scaled accordingly, and less information is accommodated on each page.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">The language in which a news publication is published, and its corresponding text encoding, is a property of the publication and not a preference expressed by the user. However, the netpage system can be configured to provide automatic translation services in various guises.</p>
<p id="h-0047" num="0000">2.2 Advertising Localization and Targeting</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">The personalization of the editorial content directly affects the advertising content, because advertising is typically placed to exploit the editorial context. Travel ads, for example, are more likely to appear in a travel section than elsewhere. The value of the editorial content to an advertiser (and therefore to the publisher) lies in its ability to attract large numbers of readers with the right demographics.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Effective advertising is placed on the basis of locality and demographics. Locality determines proximity to particular services, retailers etc., and particular interests and concerns associated with the local community and environment. Demographics determine general interests and preoccupations as well as likely spending patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">A news publisher's most profitable product is advertising &#x201c;space&#x201d;, a multi-dimensional entity determined by the publication's geographic coverage, the size of its readership, its readership demographics, and the page area available for advertising.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">In the netpage system, the netpage publication server computes the approximate multi-dimensional size of a publication's saleable advertising space on a per-section basis, taking into account the publication's geographic coverage, the section's readership, the size of each reader's section edition, each reader's advertising proportion, and each reader's demographic.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">In comparison with other media, the netpage system allows the advertising space to be defined in greater detail, and allows smaller pieces of it to be sold separately. It therefore allows it to be sold at closer to its true value.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">For example, the same advertising &#x201c;slot&#x201d; can be sold in varying proportions to several advertisers, with individual readers' pages randomly receiving the advertisement of one advertiser or another, overall preserving the proportion of space sold to each advertiser.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The netpage system allows advertising to be linked directly to detailed product information and online purchasing. It therefore raises the intrinsic value of the advertising space.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Because personalization and localization are handled automatically by netpage publication servers, an advertising aggregator can provide arbitrarily broad coverage of both geography and demographics. The subsequent disaggregation is efficient because it is automatic. This makes it more cost-effective for publishers to deal with advertising aggregators than to directly capture advertising. Even though the advertising aggregator is taking a proportion of advertising revenue, publishers may find the change profit-neutral because of the greater efficiency of aggregation. The advertising aggregator acts as an intermediary between advertisers and publishers, and may place the same advertisement in multiple publications.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">It is worth noting that ad placement in a netpage publication can be more complex than ad placement in the publication's traditional counterpart, because the publication's advertising space is more complex. While ignoring the full complexities of negotiations between advertisers, advertising aggregators and publishers, the preferred form of the netpage system provides some automated support for these negotiations, including support for automated auctions of advertising space. Automation is particularly desirable for the placement of advertisements which generate small amounts of income, such as small or highly localized advertisements.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Once placement has been negotiated, the aggregator captures and edits the advertisement and records it on a netpage ad server. Correspondingly, the publisher records the ad placement on the relevant netpage publication server. When the netpage publication server lays out each user's personalized publication, it picks the relevant advertisements from the netpage ad server.</p>
<p id="h-0048" num="0000">2.3 User Profiles</p>
<p id="h-0049" num="0000">2.3.1 Information Filtering</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">The personalization of news and other publications relies on an assortment of user-specific profile information, including:</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">publication customizations</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">collaborative filtering vectors</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">contact details</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">presentation preferences</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">The customization of a publication is typically publication-specific, and so the customization information is maintained by the relevant netpage publication server.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">A collaborative filtering vector consists of the user's ratings of a number of news items. It is used to correlate different users' interests for the purposes of making recommendations. Although there are benefits to maintaining a single collaborative filtering vector independently of any particular publication, there are two reasons why it is more practical to maintain a separate vector for each publication: there is likely to be more overlap between the vectors of subscribers to the same publication than between those of subscribers to different publications; and a publication is likely to want to present its users' collaborative filtering vectors as part of the value of its brand, not to be found elsewhere. Collaborative filtering vectors are therefore also maintained by the relevant netpage publication server.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">Contact details, including name, street address, ZIP Code, state, country, telephone numbers, are global by nature, and are maintained by a netpage registration server.</p>

<p id="p-0304" num="0303">The localization of advertising relies on the locality indicated in the user's contact details, while the targeting of advertising relies on personal information such as date of birth, gender, marital status, income, profession, education, or qualitative derivatives such as age range and income range.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">For those users who choose to reveal personal information for advertising purposes, the information is maintained by the relevant netpage registration server.

<p id="p-0306" num="0305">Each user, pen, printer, application provider and application is assigned its own unique identifier, and the netpage registration server maintains the relationships between them, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>. For registration purposes, a publisher is a special kind of application provider, and a publication is a special kind of application.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Each user <b>800</b> may be authorized to use any number of printers <b>802</b>, and each printer may allow any number of users to use it. Each user has a single default printer (at <b>66</b>), to which periodical publications are delivered by default, whilst pages printed on demand are delivered to the printer through which the user is interacting. The server keeps track of which publishers a user has authorized to print to the user's default printer. A publisher does not record the ID of any particular printer, but instead resolves the ID when it is required.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">When a user subscribes <b>808</b> to a publication <b>807</b>, the publisher <b>806</b> (i.e. application provider <b>803</b>) is authorized to print to a specified printer or the user's default printer. This authorization can be revoked at any time by the user. Each user may have several pens <b>801</b>, but a pen is specific to a single user.

<p id="h-0052" num="0000">2.4 Intelligent Page Layout</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">The netpage publication server automatically lays out the pages of each user's personalized publication on a section-by-section basis. Since most advertisements are in the form of pre-formatted rectangles, they are placed on the page before the editorial content.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">The advertising ratio for a section can be achieved with wildly varying advertising ratios on individual pages within the section, and the ad layout algorithm exploits this. The algorithm is configured to attempt to co-locate closely tied editorial and advertising content, such as placing ads for roofing material specifically within the publication because of a special feature on do-it-yourself roofing repairs.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">The editorial content selected for the user, including text and associated images and graphics, is then laid out according to various aesthetic rules.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">The entire process, including the selection of ads and the selection of editorial content, must be iterated once the layout has converged, to attempt to more closely achieve the user's stated section size preference. The section size preference can, however, be matched on average over time, allowing significant day-to-day variations.</p>
<p id="h-0053" num="0000">2.5 Document Format</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">Once the document is laid out, it is encoded for efficient distribution and persistent storage on the netpage network.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">The primary efficiency mechanism is the separation of information specific to a single user's edition and information shared between multiple users' editions. The specific information consists of the page layout. The shared information consists of the objects to which the page layout refers, including images, graphics, and pieces of text.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">A text object contains fully-formatted text represented in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) using the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). XSL provides precise control over text formatting independently of the region into which the text is being set, which in this case is being provided by the layout. The text object contains embedded language codes to enable automatic translation, and embedded hyphenation hints to aid with paragraph formatting.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">An image object encodes an image in the JPEG 2000 wavelet-based compressed image format. A graphic object encodes a 2D graphic in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">The layout itself consists of a series of placed image and graphic objects, linked textflow objects through which text objects flow, hyperlinks and input fields as described above, and watermark regions. These layout objects are summarized in Table 3. The layout uses a compact format suitable for efficient distribution and storage.</p>

2.6 Document Distribution
</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">As described above, for purposes of efficient distribution and persistent storage on the netpage network, a user-specific page layout is separated from the shared objects to which it refers.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">When a subscribed publication is ready to be distributed, the netpage publication server allocates, with the help of the netpage ID server <b>12</b>, a unique ID for each page, page instance, document, and document instance.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">The server computes a set of optimized subsets of the shared content and creates a multicast channel for each subset, and then tags each user-specific layout with the names of the multicast channels which will carry the shared content used by that layout. The server then pointcasts each user's layouts to that user's printer via the appropriate page server, and when the pointcasting is complete, multicasts the shared content on the specified channels. After receiving its pointcast, each page server and printer subscribes to the multicast channels specified in the page layouts. During the multicasts, each page server and printer extracts from the multicast streams those objects referred to by its page layouts. The page servers persistently archive the received page layouts and shared content.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">Once a printer has received all the objects to which its page layouts refer, the printer re-creates the fully-populated layout and then rasterizes and prints it.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">Under normal circumstances, the printer prints pages faster than they can be delivered. Assuming a quarter of each page is covered with images, the average page has a size of less than 400 KB. The printer can therefore hold in excess of 100 such pages in its internal 64 MB memory, allowing for temporary buffers etc. The printer prints at a rate of one page per second. This is equivalent to 400 KB or about 3 Mbit of page data per second, which is similar to the highest expected rate of page data delivery over a broadband network.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">Even under abnormal circumstances, such as when the printer runs out of paper, it is likely that the user will be able to replenish the paper supply before the printer's 100-page internal storage capacity is exhausted.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">However, if the printer's internal memory does fill up, then the printer will be unable to make use of a multicast when it first occurs. The netpage publication server therefore allows printers to submit requests for re-multicasts. When a critical number of requests is received or a timeout occurs, the server re-multicasts the corresponding shared objects.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">Once a document is printed, a printer can produce an exact duplicate at any time by retrieving its page layouts and contents from the relevant page server.</p>
<p id="h-0054" num="0000">2.7 On-Demand Documents</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">When a netpage document is requested on demand, it can be personalized and delivered in much the same way as a periodical. However, since there is no shared content, delivery is made directly to the requesting printer without the use of multicast.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">When a non-netpage document is requested on demand, it is not personalized, and it is delivered via a designated netpage formatting server which reformats it as a netpage document. A netpage formatting server is a special instance of a netpage publication server. The netpage formatting server has knowledge of various Internet document formats, including Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In the case of HTML, it can make use of the higher resolution of the printed page to present Web pages in a multi-column format, with a table of contents. It can automatically include all Web pages directly linked to the requested page. The user can tune this behavior via a preference.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">The netpage formatting server makes standard netpage behavior, including interactivity and persistence, available on any Internet document, no matter what its origin and format. It hides knowledge of different document formats from both the netpage printer and the netpage page server, and hides knowledge of the netpage system from Web servers.</p>
<p id="h-0055" num="0000">3 Security</p>
<p id="h-0056" num="0000">3.1 Cryptography</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">Cryptography is used to protect sensitive information, both in storage and in transit, and to authenticate parties to a transaction. There are two classes of cryptography in widespread use: secret-key cryptography and public-key cryptography. The netpage network uses both classes of cryptography.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336">Secret-key cryptography, also referred to as symmetric cryptography, uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. Two parties wishing to exchange messages must first arrange to securely exchange the secret key.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">Public-key cryptography, also referred to as asymmetric cryptography, uses two encryption keys. The two keys are mathematically related in such a way that any message encrypted using one key can only be decrypted using the other key. One of these keys is then published, while the other is kept private. The public key is used to encrypt any message intended for the holder of the private key. Once encrypted using the public key, a message can only be decrypted using the private key. Thus two parties can securely exchange messages without first having to exchange a secret key. To ensure that the private key is secure, it is normal for the holder of the private key to generate the key pair.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">Public-key cryptography can be used to create a digital signature. The holder of the private key can create a known hash of a message and then encrypt the hash using the private key. Anyone can then verify that the encrypted hash constitutes the &#x201c;signature&#x201d; of the holder of the private key with respect to that particular message by decrypting the encrypted hash using the public key and verifying the hash against the message. If the signature is appended to the message, then the recipient of the message can verify both that the message is genuine and that it has not been altered in transit.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">To make public-key cryptography work, there has to be a way to distribute public keys which prevents impersonation. This is normally done using certificates and certificate authorities. A certificate authority is a trusted third party which authenticates the connection between a public key and someone's identity. The certificate authority verifies the person's identity by examining identity documents, and then creates and signs a digital certificate containing the person's identity details and public key. Anyone who trusts the certificate authority can use the public key in the certificate with a high degree of certainty that it is genuine. They just have to verify that the certificate has indeed been signed by the certificate authority, whose public key is well-known.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">In most transaction environments, public-key cryptography is only used to create digital signatures and to securely exchange secret session keys. Secret-key cryptography is used for all other purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">In the following discussion, when reference is made to the secure transmission of information between a netpage printer and a server, what actually happens is that the printer obtains the server's certificate, authenticates it with reference to the certificate authority, uses the public key-exchange key in the certificate to exchange a secret session key with the server, and then uses the secret session key to encrypt the message data. A session key, by definition, can have an arbitrarily short lifetime.</p>
<p id="h-0057" num="0000">3.2 Netpage Printer Security</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">Each netpage printer is assigned a pair of unique identifiers at time of manufacture which are stored in read-only memory in the printer and in the netpage registration server database. The first ID <b>62</b> is public and uniquely identifies the printer on the netpage network. The second ID is secret and is used when the printer is first registered on the network.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">When the printer connects to the netpage network for the first time after installation, it creates a signature public/private key pair. It transmits the secret ID and the public key securely to the netpage registration server. The server compares the secret ID against the printer's secret ID recorded in its database, and accepts the registration if the IDs match. It then creates and signs a certificate containing the printer's public ID and public signature key, and stores the certificate in the registration database.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">The netpage registration server acts as a certificate authority for netpage printers, since it has access to secret information allowing it to verify printer identity.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">When a user subscribes to a publication, a record is created in the netpage registration server database authorizing the publisher to print the publication to the user's default printer or a specified printer. Every document sent to a printer via a page server is addressed to a particular user and is signed by the publisher using the publisher's private signature key. The page server verifies, via the registration database, that the publisher is authorized to deliver the publication to the specified user. The page server verifies the signature using the publisher's public key, obtained from the publisher's certificate stored in the registration database.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">The netpage registration server accepts requests to add printing authorizations to the database, so long as those requests are initiated via a pen registered to the printer.</p>
<p id="h-0058" num="0000">3.3 Netpage Pen Security</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">Each netpage pen is assigned a unique identifier at time of manufacture which is stored in read-only memory in the pen and in the netpage registration server database. The pen ID <b>61</b> uniquely identifies the pen on the netpage network.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">A netpage pen can &#x201c;know&#x201d; a number of netpage printers, and a printer can &#x201c;know&#x201d; a number of pens. A pen communicates with a printer via a radio frequency signal whenever it is within range of the printer. Once a pen and printer are registered, they regularly exchange session keys. Whenever the pen transmits digital ink to the printer, the digital ink is always encrypted using the appropriate session key. Digital ink is never transmitted in the clear.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">A pen stores a session key for every printer it knows, indexed by printer ID, and a printer stores a session key for every pen it knows, indexed by pen ID. Both have a large but finite storage capacity for session keys, and will forget a session key on a least-recently-used basis if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">When a pen comes within range of a printer, the pen and printer discover whether they know each other. If they don't know each other, then the printer determines whether it is supposed to know the pen. This might be, for example, because the pen belongs to a user who is registered to use the printer. If the printer is meant to know the pen but doesn't, then it initiates the automatic pen registration procedure. If the printer isn't meant to know the pen, then it agrees with the pen to ignore it until the pen is placed in a charging cup, at which time it initiates the registration procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">In addition to its public ID, the pen contains a secret key-exchange key. The key-exchange key is also recorded in the netpage registration server database at time of manufacture. During registration, the pen transmits its pen ID to the printer, and the printer transmits the pen ID to the netpage registration server. The server generates a session key for the printer and pen to use, and securely transmits the session key to the printer. It also transmits a copy of the session key encrypted with the pen's key-exchange key. The printer stores the session key internally, indexed by the pen ID, and transmits the encrypted session key to the pen. The pen stores the session key internally, indexed by the printer ID.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">Although a fake pen can impersonate a pen in the pen registration protocol, only a real pen can decrypt the session key transmitted by the printer.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">When a previously unregistered pen is first registered, it is of limited use until it is linked to a user. A registered but &#x201c;un-owned&#x201d; pen is only allowed to be used to request and fill in netpage user and pen registration forms, to register a new user to which the new pen is automatically linked, or to add a new pen to an existing user.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">The pen uses secret-key rather than public-key encryption because of hardware performance constraints in the pen.</p>
<p id="h-0059" num="0000">3.4 Secure Documents</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">The netpage system supports the delivery of secure documents such as tickets and coupons. The netpage printer includes a facility to print watermarks, but will only do so on request from publishers who are suitably authorized. The publisher indicates its authority to print watermarks in its certificate, which the printer is able to authenticate.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">The &#x201c;watermark&#x201d; printing process uses an alternative dither matrix in specified &#x201c;watermark&#x201d; regions of the page. Back-to-back pages contain mirror-image watermark regions which coincide when printed. The dither matrices used in odd and even pages' watermark regions are designed to produce an interference effect when the regions are viewed together, achieved by looking through the printed sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">The effect is similar to a watermark in that it is not visible when looking at only one side of the page, and is lost when the page is copied by normal means.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">Pages of secure documents cannot be copied using the built-in netpage copy mechanism described in Section 1.9 above. This extends to copying netpages on netpage-aware photocopiers.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">Secure documents are typically generated as part of e-commerce transactions. They can therefore include the user's photograph which was captured when the user registered biometric information with the netpage registration server, as described in Section 2.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">When presented with a secure netpage document, the recipient can verify its authenticity by requesting its status in the usual way. The unique ID of a secure document is only valid for the lifetime of the document, and secure document IDs are allocated non-contiguously to prevent their prediction by opportunistic forgers. A secure document verification pen can be developed with built-in feedback on verification failure, to support easy point-of-presentation document verification.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">Clearly neither the watermark nor the user's photograph are secure in a cryptographic sense. They simply provide a significant obstacle to casual forgery. Online document verification, particularly using a verification pen, provides an added level of security where it is needed, but is still not entirely immune to forgeries.</p>
<p id="h-0060" num="0000">3.5 Non-Repudiation</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">In the netpage system, forms submitted by users are delivered reliably to forms handlers and are persistently archived on netpage page servers. It is therefore impossible for recipients to repudiate delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">E-commerce payments made through the system, as described in Section 4, are also impossible for the payee to repudiate.</p>
<p id="h-0061" num="0000">4 Electronic Commerce Model</p>
<p id="h-0062" num="0000">4.1 Secure Electronic Transaction (Set)</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">The netpage system uses the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) system as one of its payment systems. SET, having been developed by MasterCard and Visa, is organized around payment cards, and this is reflected in the terminology. However, much of the system is independent of the type of accounts being used.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">In SET, cardholders and merchants register with a certificate authority and are issued with certificates containing their public signature keys. The certificate authority verifies a cardholder's registration details with the card issuer as appropriate, and verifies a merchant's registration details with the acquirer as appropriate. Cardholders and merchants store their respective private signature keys securely on their computers. During the payment process, these certificates are used to mutually authenticate a merchant and cardholder, and to authenticate them both to the payment gateway.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">SET has not yet been adopted widely, partly because cardholder maintenance of keys and certificates is considered burdensome. Interim solutions which maintain cardholder keys and certificates on a server and give the cardholder access via a password have met with some success.</p>
<p id="h-0063" num="0000">4.2 Set Payments</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">In the netpage system the netpage registration server acts as a proxy for the netpage user (i.e. the cardholder) in SET payment transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">The netpage system uses biometrics to authenticate the user and authorize SET payments. Because the system is pen-based, the biometric used is the user's on-line signature, consisting of time-varying pen position and pressure. A fingerprint biometric can also be used by designing a fingerprint sensor into the pen, although at a higher cost. The type of biometric used only affects the capture of the biometric, not the authorization aspects of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">The first step to being able to make SET payments is to register the user's biometric with the netpage registration server. This is done in a controlled environment, for example a bank, where the biometric can be captured at the same time as the user's identity is verified. The biometric is captured and stored in the registration database, linked to the user's record. The user's photograph is also optionally captured and linked to the record. The SET cardholder registration process is completed, and the resulting private signature key and certificate are stored in the database. The user's payment card information is also stored, giving the netpage registration server enough information to act as the user's proxy in any SET payment transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">When the user eventually supplies the biometric to complete a payment, for example by signing a netpage order form, the printer securely transmits the order information, the pen ID and the biometric data to the netpage registration server. The server verifies the biometric with respect to the user identified by the pen ID, and from then on acts as the user's proxy in completing the SET payment transaction.</p>
<p id="h-0064" num="0000">4.3 Micro-Payments</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">The netpage system includes a mechanism for micro-payments, to allow the user to be conveniently charged for printing low-cost documents on demand and for copying copyright documents, and possibly also to allow the user to be reimbursed for expenses incurred in printing advertising material. The latter depends on the level of subsidy already provided to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">When the user registers for e-commerce, a network account is established which aggregates micro-payments. The user receives a statement on a regular basis, and can settle any outstanding debit balance using the standard payment mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373">The network account can be extended to aggregate subscription fees for periodicals, which would also otherwise be presented to the user in the form of individual statements.</p>
<p id="h-0065" num="0000">4.4 Transactions</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">When a user requests a netpage in a particular application context, the application is able to embed a user-specific transaction ID <b>55</b> in the page. Subsequent input through the page is tagged with the transaction ID, and the application is thereby able to establish an appropriate context for the user's input.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">When input occurs through a page which is not user-specific, however, the application must use the user's unique identity to establish a context. A typical example involves adding items from a pre-printed catalog page to the user's virtual &#x201c;shopping cart&#x201d;. To protect the user's privacy, however, the unique user ID <b>60</b> known to the netpage system is not divulged to applications. This is to prevent different application providers from easily correlating independently accumulated behavioral data.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">The netpage registration server instead maintains an anonymous relationship between a user and an application via a unique alias ID <b>65</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Whenever the user activates a hyperlink tagged with the &#x201c;registered&#x201d; attribute, the netpage page server asks the netpage registration server to translate the associated application ID <b>64</b>, together with the pen ID <b>61</b>, into an alias ID <b>65</b>. The alias ID is then submitted to the hyperlink's application.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">The application maintains state information indexed by alias ID, and is able to retrieve user-specific state information without knowledge of the global identity of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">The system also maintains an independent certificate and private signature key for each of a user's applications, to allow it to sign application transactions on behalf of the user using only application-specific information.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">To assist the system in routing product bar code (UPC) &#x201c;hyperlink&#x201d; activations, the system records a favorite application on behalf of the user for any number of product types.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0380">Each application is associated with an application provider, and the system maintains an account on behalf of each application provider, to allow it to credit and debit the provider for click-through fees etc.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">An application provider can be a publisher of periodical subscribed content. The system records the user's willingness to receive the subscribed publication, as well as the expected frequency of publication.</p>
<p id="h-0066" num="0000">4.5 Resource Descriptions and Copyright</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">A preferred embodiment of a resource description class diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">Each document and content object may be described by one or more resource descriptions <b>842</b>. Resource descriptions use the Dublin Core metadata element set, which is designed to facilitate discovery of electronic resources. Dublin Core metadata conforms to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Resource Description Framework (RDF).</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">A resource description may identify rights holders <b>920</b>. The netpage system automatically transfers copyright fees from users to rights holders when users print copyright content.</p>
<p id="h-0067" num="0000">5 Communications Protocols</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">A communications protocol defines an ordered exchange of messages between entities.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">In the netpage system, entities such as pens, printers and servers utilise a set of defined protocols to cooperatively handle user interaction with the netpage system.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">Each protocol is illustrated by way of a sequence diagram in which the horizontal dimension is used to represent message flow and the vertical dimension is used to represent time. Each entity is represented by a rectangle containing the name of the entity and a vertical column representing the lifeline of the entity. During the time an entity exists, the lifeline is shown as a dashed line. During the time an entity is active, the lifeline is shown as a double line. Because the protocols considered here do not create or destroy entities, lifelines are generally cut short as soon as an entity ceases to participate in a protocol.</p>
<p id="h-0068" num="0000">5.1 Subscription Delivery Protocol</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">A preferred embodiment of a subscription delivery protocol is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">A large number of users may subscribe to a periodical publication. Each user's edition may be laid out differently, but many users' editions will share common content such as text objects and image objects. The subscription delivery protocol therefore delivers document structures to individual printers via pointcast, but delivers shared content objects via multicast.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">The application (i.e. publisher) first obtains a document ID <b>51</b> for each document from an ID server <b>12</b>. It then sends each document structure, including its document ID and page descriptions, to the page server <b>10</b> responsible for the document's newly allocated ID. It includes its own application ID <b>64</b>, the subscriber's alias ID <b>65</b>, and the relevant set of multicast channel names. It signs the message using its private signature key.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">The page server uses the application ID and alias ID to obtain from the registration server the corresponding user ID <b>60</b>, the user's selected printer ID <b>62</b> (which may be explicitly selected for the application, or may be the user's default printer), and the application's certificate.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">The application's certificate allows the page server to verify the message signature. The page server's request to the registration server fails if the application ID and alias ID don't together identify a subscription <b>808</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">The page server then allocates document and page instance IDs and forwards the page descriptions, including page IDs <b>50</b>, to the printer. It includes the relevant set of multicast channel names for the printer to listen to.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">It then returns the newly allocated page IDs to the application for future reference.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">Once the application has distributed all of the document structures to the subscribers' selected printers via the relevant page servers, it multicasts the various subsets of the shared objects on the previously selected multicast channels. Both page servers and printers monitor the appropriate multicast channels and receive their required content objects. They are then able to populate the previously pointcast document structures. This allows the page servers to add complete documents to their databases, and it allows the printers to print the documents.</p>

<p id="p-0397" num="0396">A preferred embodiment of a hyperlink activation protocol is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">When a user clicks on a netpage with a netpage pen, the pen communicates the click to the nearest netpage printer <b>601</b>.

The printer then forwards the pen ID, its own printer ID <b>62</b>, the page ID and click location to the page server.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">The page server loads the page description <b>5</b> identified by the page ID and determines which input element's zone <b>58</b>, if any, the click lies in. Assuming the relevant input element is a hyperlink element <b>844</b>, the page server then obtains the associated application ID <b>64</b> and link ID <b>54</b>, and determines, via the DNS, the network address of the application server hosting the application <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">The page server uses the pen ID <b>61</b> to obtain the corresponding user ID <b>60</b> from the registration server <b>11</b>, and then allocates a globally unique hyperlink request ID <b>52</b> and builds a hyperlink request <b>934</b>. The hyperlink request class diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>. The hyperlink request records the IDs of the requesting user and printer, and identifies the clicked hyperlink instance <b>862</b>. The page server then sends its own server ID <b>53</b>, the hyperlink request ID, and the link ID to the application.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">The application produces a response document according to application-specific logic, and obtains a document ID <b>51</b> from an ID server <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0403" num="0402">The second page server sends the hyperlink request ID and application ID to the first page server to obtain the corresponding user ID and printer ID <b>62</b>. The first page server rejects the request if the hyperlink request has expired or is for a different application.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">The second page server allocates document instance and page IDs <b>50</b>, returns the newly allocated page IDs to the application, adds the complete document to its own database, and finally sends the page descriptions to the requesting printer.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">The hyperlink instance may include a meaningful transaction ID <b>55</b>, in which case the first page server includes the transaction ID in the message sent to the application. This allows the application to establish a transaction-specific context for the hyperlink activation.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">If the hyperlink requires a user alias, i.e. its &#x201c;alias required&#x201d; attribute is set, then the first page server sends both the pen ID <b>61</b> and the hyperlink's application ID <b>64</b> to the registration server <b>11</b> to obtain not just the user ID corresponding to the pen ID but also the alias ID <b>65</b> corresponding to the application ID and the user ID. It includes the alias ID in the message sent to the application, allowing the application to establish a user-specific context for the hyperlink activation.</p>
<p id="h-0070" num="0000">5.3 Handwriting Recognition Protocol</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">When a user draws a stroke on a netpage with a netpage pen, the pen communicates the stroke to the nearest netpage printer. The stroke identifies the page and a path on the page.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">The printer forwards the pen ID <b>61</b>, its own printer ID <b>62</b>, the page ID <b>50</b> and stroke path to the page server <b>10</b> in the usual way.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">The page server loads the page description <b>5</b> identified by the page ID and determines which input element's zone <b>58</b>, if any, the stroke intersects. Assuming the relevant input element is a text field <b>878</b>, the page server appends the stroke to the text field's digital ink.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">After a period of inactivity in the zone of the text field, the page server sends the pen ID and the pending strokes to the registration server <b>11</b> for interpretation. The registration server identifies the user corresponding to the pen, and uses the user's accumulated handwriting model <b>822</b> to interpret the strokes as handwritten text. Once it has converted the strokes to text, the registration server returns the text to the requesting page server. The page server appends the text to the text value of the text field.</p>
<p id="h-0071" num="0000">5.4 Signature Verification Protocol</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">Assuming the input element whose zone the stroke intersects is a signature field <b>880</b>, the page server <b>10</b> appends the stroke to the signature field's digital ink.</p>

It also sends the application ID <b>64</b> associated with the form of which the signature field is part, as well as the form ID <b>56</b> and the current data content of the form. The registration server identifies the user corresponding to the pen, and uses the user's dynamic signature biometric <b>818</b> to verify the strokes as the user's signature. Once it has verified the signature, the registration server uses the application ID <b>64</b> and user ID <b>60</b> to identify the user's application-specific private signature key. It then uses the key to generate a digital signature of the form data, and returns the digital signature to the requesting page server. The page server assigns the digital signature to the signature field and sets the associated form's status to frozen.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">The digital signature includes the alias ID <b>65</b> of the corresponding user. This allows a single form to capture multiple users' signatures.</p>

It incorporates a dedicated circuit <b>150</b> which monitors the force sensor photodiode <b>144</b> and wakes up the controller <b>134</b> via the power manager <b>151</b> on a pen-down event.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">The radio transceiver communicates in the unlicensed 900 MHz band normally used by cordless telephones, or alternatively in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band, and uses frequency hopping and collision detection to provide interference-free communication.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">In an alternative embodiment, the pen incorporates an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) interface for short-range communication with a base station or netpage printer.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442">In a further embodiment, the pen <b>101</b> includes a pair of orthogonal accelerometers mounted in the normal plane of the pen <b>101</b> axis. The accelerometers <b>190</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> in ghost outline.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">The provision of the accelerometers enables this embodiment of the pen <b>101</b> to sense motion without reference to surface location tags, allowing the location tags to be sampled at a lower rate. Each location tag ID can then identify an object of interest rather than a position on the surface. For example, if the object is a user interface input element (e.g. a command button), then the tag ID of each location tag within the area of the input element can directly identify the input element.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">The acceleration measured by the accelerometers in each of the x and y directions is integrated with respect to time to produce an instantaneous velocity and position.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0445">Since the starting position of the stroke is not known, only relative positions within a stroke are calculated. Although position integration accumulates errors in the sensed acceleration, accelerometers typically have high resolution, and the time duration of a stroke, over which errors accumulate, is short.</p>

<p id="h-0078" num="0000">7.1 Printer Mechanics</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0446">The vertically-mounted netpage wallprinter <b>601</b> is shown fully assembled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. It prints netpages on Letter/A4 sized media using duplexed 8&#xbd;&#x2033; Memjet&#x2122; print engines <b>602</b> and <b>603</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 12</figref><i>a</i>. It uses a straight paper path with the paper <b>604</b> passing through the duplexed print engines <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> which print both sides of a sheet simultaneously, in full color and with full bleed.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0447">An integral binding assembly <b>605</b> applies a strip of glue along one edge of each printed sheet, allowing it to adhere to the previous sheet when pressed against it. This creates a final bound document <b>618</b> which can range in thickness from one sheet to several hundred sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0448">The replaceable ink cartridge <b>627</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> coupled with the duplexed print engines, has bladders or chambers for storing fixative, adhesive, and cyan, magenta, yellow, black and infrared inks. The cartridge also contains a micro air filter in a base molding. The micro air filter interfaces with an air pump <b>638</b> inside the printer via a hose <b>639</b>. This provides filtered air to the printheads to prevent ingress of micro particles into the Memjet&#x2122; printheads <b>350</b> which might otherwise clog the printhead nozzles. By incorporating the air filter within the cartridge, the operational life of the filter is effectively linked to the life of the cartridge. The ink cartridge is a fully recyclable product with a capacity for printing and gluing 3000 pages (1500 sheets).</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0449">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the motorized media pick-up roller assembly <b>626</b> pushes the top sheet directly from the media tray past a paper sensor on the first print engine <b>602</b> into the duplexed Memjet&#x2122; printhead assembly. The two Memjet&#x2122; print engines <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> are mounted in an opposing in-line sequential configuration along the straight paper path. The paper <b>604</b> is drawn into the first print engine <b>602</b> by integral, powered pick-up rollers <b>626</b>. The position and size of the paper <b>604</b> is sensed and full bleed printing commences. Fixative is printed simultaneously to aid drying in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0450">The paper exits the first Memjet&#x2122; print engine <b>602</b> through a set of powered exit spike wheels (aligned along the straight paper path), which act against a rubberized roller. These spike wheels contact the &#x2018;wet&#x2019; printed surface and continue to feed the sheet <b>604</b> into the second Memjet&#x2122; print engine <b>603</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0451">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 12</figref><i>a</i>, the paper <b>604</b> passes from the duplexed print engines <b>602</b> and <b>603</b> into the binder assembly <b>605</b>. The printed page passes between a powered spike wheel axle <b>670</b> with a fibrous support roller and another movable axle with spike wheels and a momentary action glue wheel. The movable axle/glue assembly <b>673</b> is mounted to a metal support bracket and it is transported forward to interface with the powered axle <b>670</b> via gears by action of a camshaft. A separate motor powers this camshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">The glue wheel assembly <b>673</b> consists of a partially hollow axle <b>679</b> with a rotating coupling for the glue supply hose <b>641</b> from the ink cartridge <b>627</b>. This axle <b>679</b> connects to a glue wheel, which absorbs adhesive by capillary action through radial holes. A molded housing <b>682</b> surrounds the glue wheel, with an opening at the front. Pivoting side moldings and sprung outer doors are attached to the metal bracket and hinge out sideways when the rest of the assembly <b>673</b> is thrust forward. This action exposes the glue wheel through the front of the molded housing <b>682</b>. Tension springs close the assembly and effectively cap the glue wheel during periods of inactivity.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0453">As the sheet <b>604</b> passes into the glue wheel assembly <b>673</b>, adhesive is applied to one vertical edge on the front side (apart from the first sheet of a document) as it is transported down into the binding assembly <b>605</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0079" num="0000">7.2 Printer Controller Architecture</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0454">The netpage printer controller consists of a controlling processor <b>750</b>, a factory-installed or field-installed network interface module <b>625</b>, a radio transceiver (transceiver controller <b>753</b>, baseband circuit <b>754</b>, RF circuit <b>755</b>, and RF resonators and inductors <b>756</b>), dual raster image processor (RIP) DSPs <b>757</b>, duplexed print engine controllers <b>760</b><i>a </i>and <b>760</b><i>b</i>, flash memory <b>658</b>, and 64 MB of DRAM <b>657</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455">The controlling processor handles communication with the network <b>19</b> and with local wireless netpage pens <b>101</b>, senses the help button <b>617</b>, controls the user interface LEDs <b>613</b>-<b>616</b>, and feeds and synchronizes the RIP DSPs <b>757</b> and print engine controllers <b>760</b>. It consists of a medium-performance general-purpose microprocessor. The controlling processor <b>750</b> communicates with the print engine controllers <b>760</b> via a high-speed serial bus <b>659</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0456">The RIP DSPs rasterize and compress page descriptions to the netpage printer's compressed page format. Each print engine controller expands, dithers and prints page images to its associated Memjet&#x2122; printhead <b>350</b> in real time (i.e. at over 30 pages per minute). The duplexed print engine controllers print both sides of a sheet simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0457">The master print engine controller <b>760</b><i>a </i>controls the paper transport and monitors ink usage in conjunction with the master QA chip <b>665</b> and the ink cartridge QA chip <b>761</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0458">The printer controller's flash memory <b>658</b> holds the software for both the processor <b>750</b> and the DSPs <b>757</b>, as well as configuration data. This is copied to main memory <b>657</b> at boot time.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0459">The processor <b>750</b>, DSPs <b>757</b>, and digital transceiver components (transceiver controller <b>753</b> and baseband circuit <b>754</b>) are integrated in a single controller ASIC <b>656</b>. Analog RF components (RF circuit <b>755</b> and RF resonators and inductors <b>756</b>) are provided in a separate RF chip <b>762</b>. The network interface module <b>625</b> is separate, since netpage printers allow the network connection to be factory-selected or field-selected. Flash memory <b>658</b> and the 2&#xd7;256 Mbit (64 MB) DRAM <b>657</b> is also off-chip. The print engine controllers <b>760</b> are provided in separate ASICs.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0460">A variety of network interface modules <b>625</b> are provided, each providing a netpage network interface <b>751</b> and optionally a local computer or network interface <b>752</b>. Netpage network Internet interfaces include POTS modems, Hybrid Fiber-Coax (HFC) cable modems, ISDN modems, DSL modems, satellite transceivers, current and next-generation cellular telephone transceivers, and wireless local loop (WLL) transceivers. Local interfaces include IEEE 1284 (parallel port), 10 Base-T and 100 Base-T Ethernet, USB and USB 2.0, IEEE 1394 (Firewire), and various emerging home networking interfaces. If an Internet connection is available on the local network, then the local network interface can be used as the netpage network interface.</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0461">The radio transceiver <b>753</b> communicates in the unlicensed 900 MHz band normally used by cordless telephones, or alternatively in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band, and uses frequency hopping and collision detection to provide interference-free communication.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0462">The printer controller optionally incorporates an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) interface for receiving data &#x201c;squirted&#x201d; from devices such as netpage cameras. In an alternative embodiment, the printer uses the IrDA interface for short-range communication with suitably configured netpage pens.</p>
<p id="h-0080" num="0000">7.2.1 Rasterization and Printing</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0463">Once the main processor <b>750</b> has received and verified the document's page layouts and page objects, it runs the appropriate RIP software on the DSPs <b>757</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0464">The DSPs <b>757</b> rasterize each page description and compress the rasterized page image. The main processor stores each compressed page image in memory. The simplest way to load-balance multiple DSPs is to let each DSP rasterize a separate page. The DSPs can always be kept busy since an arbitrary number of rasterized pages can, in general, be stored in memory. This strategy only leads to potentially poor DSP utilization when rasterizing short documents.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0465">Watermark regions in the page description are rasterized to a contone-resolution bi-level bitmap which is losslessly compressed to negligible size and which forms part of the compressed page image.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0466">The infrared (IR) layer of the printed page contains coded netpage tags at a density of about six per inch. Each tag encodes the page ID, tag ID, and control bits, and the data content of each tag is generated during rasterization and stored in the compressed page image.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0467">The main processor <b>750</b> passes back-to-back page images to the duplexed print engine controllers <b>760</b>. Each print engine controller <b>760</b> stores the compressed page image in its local memory, and starts the page expansion and printing pipeline. Page expansion and printing is pipelined because it is impractical to store an entire 114 MB bi-level CMYK+IR page image in memory.</p>
<p id="h-0081" num="0000">7.2.2 Print Engine Controller</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0468">The page expansion and printing pipeline of the print engine controller <b>760</b> consists of a high speed IEEE 1394 serial interface <b>659</b>, a standard JPEG decoder <b>763</b>, a standard Group 4 Fax decoder <b>764</b>, a custom halftoner/compositor unit <b>765</b>, a custom tag encoder <b>766</b>, a line loader/formatter unit <b>767</b>, and a custom interface <b>768</b> to the Memjet&#x2122; printhead <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0469">The print engine controller <b>360</b> operates in a double buffered manner. While one page is loaded into DRAM <b>769</b> via the high speed serial interface <b>659</b>, the previously loaded page is read from DRAM <b>769</b> and passed through the print engine controller pipeline. Once the page has finished printing, the page just loaded is printed while another page is loaded.</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0470">The first stage of the pipeline expands (at <b>763</b>) the JPEG-compressed contone CMYK layer, expands (at <b>764</b>) the Group 4 Fax-compressed bi-level black layer, and renders (at <b>766</b>) the bi-level netpage tag layer according to the tag format defined in section 1.2, all in parallel. The second stage dithers (at <b>765</b>) the contone CMYK layer and composites (at <b>765</b>) the bi-level black layer over the resulting bi-level CMYK layer. The resultant bi-level CMYK+IR dot data is buffered and formatted (at <b>767</b>) for printing on the Memjet&#x2122; printhead <b>350</b> via a set of line buffers. Most of these line buffers are stored in the off-chip DRAM. The final stage prints the six channels of bi-level dot data (including fixative) to the Memjet&#x2122; printhead <b>350</b> via the printhead interface <b>768</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0471">When several print engine controllers <b>760</b> are used in unison, such as in a duplexed configuration, they are synchronized via a shared line sync signal <b>770</b>. Only one print engine <b>760</b>, selected via the external master/slave pin <b>771</b>, generates the line sync signal <b>770</b> onto the shared line.</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0472">The print engine controller <b>760</b> contains a low-speed processor <b>772</b> for synchronizing the page expansion and rendering pipeline, configuring the printhead <b>350</b> via a low-speed serial bus <b>773</b>, and controlling the stepper motors <b>675</b>, <b>676</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0473">In the 8&#xbd;&#x2033; versions of the netpage printer, the two print engines each prints 30 Letter pages per minute along the long dimension of the page (11&#x2033;), giving a line rate of 8.8 kHz at 1600 dpi. In the 12&#x2033; versions of the netpage printer, the two print engines each prints 45 Letter pages per minute along the short dimension of the page (8&#xbd;&#x2033;), giving a line rate of 10.2 kHz. These line rates are well within the operating frequency of the Memjet&#x2122; printhead, which in the current design exceeds 30 kHz.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of wireless communication, and more particularly, to a method and device for information transfer in wireless communication.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To increase the competence of the future network, Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is developing a brand new evolved network, which is also referred as an Access Network (AN) of Release 8 (R8) or later versions herein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Under the system architecture of the current AN, that is, under the system architecture of the AN of Release 7 (R7) or earlier versions, the procedure for inter-/intra-system handover and change is substantially the same as that of R8 or later versions with the difference that, in the R7 or earlier versions, when a source Mobility Management Network Element (MMNE) transmits a Forward Relocation Request message or a Context Response message to a destination MMNE, a Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context/bearer context information of R7 or earlier versions includes IP address and Tunnel Endpoint Identity (TEID) information of a Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW), and the destination MMNE directly transmits an Update Bearer Request message to the P-GW and receives an Update Bearer Response message from the P-GW.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above difference is due to the following reason: in the AN of R8 or later versions, a user equipment (UE) uses two user plane gateway devices, one is a Serving-Gateway (S-GW) and the other is a P-GW. The S-GW is the user plane anchor point of the 3GPP access network, which is also referred to as the Serving-Gateway entity or the user plane anchor point corresponding to ANs of higher versions. The P-GW is the anchor point between the 3GPP access network and non-3GPP access networks, which is also referred to as Packet Data Network Gateway entity or the user plane anchor point corresponding to ANs of lower versions. Therefore, the PDP context/bearer context of the UE includes information of such two user plane anchor points, that is, information of the S-GW and P-GW, such as address and TEID of the S-GW, and address and TEID of the P-GW. However, in the AN of R7 or earlier versions, the UE uses one user plane gateway device, i.e. the Gateway General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Supporting Node (GGSN), which is responsible for interfacing with external networks and implementing user plane data transfer. The GGSN is the user plane anchor point between the 3GPP networks of R7 or earlier versions and is equivalent to P-GW in the architecture of an embodiment of present invention. Therefore, the PDP context/bearer context of the UE includes the information of this anchor point, i.e. the information of P-GW, such as address and TEID of the P-GW.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus a problem is raised, that is, when handover/changing occurs between an AN of R8 or later versions and that of R7 or earlier versions, how does the source AN correctly transmit the user plane anchor point information needed by the destination AN?</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The prior art described above also has the following drawbacks: the PDP context/bearer context Information Element (IE) carried in the Forward Relocation Request or Context Response by the source AN also carries information such as Quality of Service (QoS). In the AN of R8 or later versions, when the source MMNE transmits the Forward Relocation Request or Context Response message to the destination MMNE, the format and parameters of the information, such as QoS, carried in the PDP context/bearer context is the format and parameters of the information for R8 or later versions, while the destination MMNE of R7 or earlier versions may be unable to identify such format and parameters, thus the PDP context/bearer context IE transferred by the source MMNE of R8 or later versions may not be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It can be seen from the above description that, when a user hands over or changes between networks of different versions, the source AN cannot transfer information of the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An embodiment of the invention provides a method and device for information transfer, which may transfer corresponding information of a user when the user hands over or changes between access networks of different versions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The technical solution according to the embodiments of the invention is realized as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A method for information transfer includes: transmitting, by a source Mobility Management Network Element (MMNE) of a source Access Network (AN), both user information corresponding to a lower version AN and user information corresponding to a higher version AN to a destination MMNE of a destination AN, when the source AN is of higher version.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A method for information transfer includes: determining, by a source Mobility Management Network Element (MMNE) of a source Access Network (AN), a version number of GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) used between the source MMNE and a destination MMNE of a destination AN; and transmitting, by the source MMNE, user information corresponding to the version number of the GTP used between the source MMNE and the destination MMNE to the destination MMNE.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A device for information transfer includes: an Information Element (IE) generation module (<b>401</b>), configured to generate an IE carrying user information, the user information including both user information corresponding to a lower version Access Network (AN) and user information corresponding to a higher version AN; and a transmission module (<b>402</b>), configured to transmit the IE generated by the IE generation module (<b>401</b>) to a destination Mobility Management Network Element (MMNE).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A device for information transfer includes: a determination module (<b>501</b>), configured to determine a version number of GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) used between a source Mobility Management Network Element (MMNE) and a destination MMNE, and to transmit a determination result to an Information Element (IE) generation module (<b>502</b>); the IE generation module (<b>502</b>), configured to generate an IE carrying user information, the user information including user information corresponding to the version number of GTP used between the source MMNE and the destination MMNE; and a transmission module (<b>503</b>), configured to transmit the IE generated by the IE generation module (<b>502</b>) to the destination MMNE.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It can be seen from the above technical solutions that, with the method and device for information transfer according to the embodiments of the present invention, the source MMNE transmits both the user information corresponding to the lower version AN and the user information corresponding to the higher version AN to the destination MMNE; or alternatively, it directly transmits the user information corresponding to the version of the destination AN to the destination MMNE. As a result, the needed information may be correctly received regardless of the version of the AN. Thus, when the user hands over or changes between ANs of different versions, the transfer of the user information may be achieved with the method and device for information transfer according to the embodiments of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When a source AN transmits user information to a destination AN, if the source AN is of lower version, such as R7 or earlier versions nowadays, the user information transmitted from the source AN to the destination AN is user information corresponding to the lower version AN; while if the source AN is of higher version, such as R8 or later versions nowadays, the user information transmitted from the source AN to the destination AN is both the user information corresponding to the lower version AN and the user information corresponding to the higher version AN.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A case where the user information is user plane anchor point information will be discussed first. In the following embodiments, the procedure for transferring user plane anchor point information between ANs of different versions will be described with reference to the inter/intra-system change and handover procedure. When the source AN is a lower version AN, that is, an AN of R7 or earlier versions, the user plane anchor point information is user plane anchor point information corresponding to the AN of R7 or earlier versions, that is, the P-GW information. When the source AN is a higher version AN, that is, an AN of R8 or later versions, the user plane anchor point information is user plane anchor point information corresponding to the AN of R8 or later versions, that is, both the S-GW and P-GW information.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart of a user plane anchor point processing method for realizing handover between ANs of different versions according to the first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the method mainly includes the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Step <b>201</b>: A source access network element (SANE) initiates a handover to hand a UE over to a destination AN. If the source AN is the GERAN, the SANE will be a base station controller (BSC). If the source AN is the UTRAN, the SANE will be a radio network controller (RNC). If the source AN is the EUTRAN, the SANE will be an evolved NodeB (ENodeB).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Step <b>202</b>: The SANE transmits a Relocation Request message to a source MMNE. If the source AN is the GERAN/UTRAN, the source MMNE will be an SGSN. If the source AN is the EUTRAN, the source MMNE will be an MME.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Step <b>203</b>: The source MMNE transmits a Forward Relocation Request message to a destination MMNE. If the destination AN is the GERAN/UTRAN, the destination MMNE will be the SGSN. If the destination AN is the EUTRAN, the destination MMNE will be the MME.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If the source AN is of R8 or later versions, the source MMNE carries in the Forward Relocation Request message two PDP context/bearer context Information Elements (IEs). One of the PDP context/bearer context IEs is a PDP context/bearer context IE of R8 or later versions, the other PDP context/bearer context IE is a PDP context/bearer context IE of R7 or earlier versions. The PDP context/bearer context IE of R8 or later versions carries the user plane anchor point information of the AN of R8 or later versions, such as address and TEID information of the S-GW and address and TEID information of the P-GW. The PDP context/bearer context IE of R7 or earlier versions carries the user plane anchor point information of the AN of R7 or earlier versions, such as address and TEID information of the P-GW.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Step <b>204</b>: The destination MMNE creates the PDP context/bearer context and requests the destination access network element (DANE) to establish radio bearer resource.

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, as high definition (HD) digital broadcasting has been carried out, digital televisions having various functions have been developed. Some digital televisions have functions such as picture-in-picture (PIP) and double window display that use technology of decoding MPEG video streams incoming from different channels.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to decode MPEG video streams incoming from different channels, two discrete MPEG decoder chips have been used or an expensive MPEG decoder chip including two video decoders has been used.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are block diagrams illustrating conventional video decoding systems for decoding and displaying two HD video signals, which are also disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004-0028142. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a conventional video decoding system <b>10</b> for decoding and displaying two HD video signals. The conventional system <b>10</b> has two video decoders. Each of the video decoders included in the video decoding system <b>10</b> includes a buffer, a variable length decoder VLD, an inverse quantizer IQ, an inverse discrete cosine transformer IDCT and a motion compensation circuit MC. As exemplified by the system <b>10</b>, when each of the video decoders has the same kind of building blocks arranged individually, the video decoding system may be simple but the video decoding system may have a large chip size when implemented on semiconductor integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a conventional video decoding system <b>20</b> for decoding and displaying two HD video signals. The video decoding system <b>20</b> includes buffers <b>301</b> and <b>305</b>, a variable length decoder <b>302</b> and a motion compensation circuit MC that are used commonly for the two compressed HD video signals incoming from different channels. Thus, the video decoding system <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may have a relatively smaller chip size than the system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> when implemented on semiconductor integrated circuits. Unfortunately, the video decoding system <b>20</b> still includes two inverse quantizers IQ and two inverse discrete cosine transformers IDCT for the two compressed HD video signals incoming from different channels.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, the conventional video decoding systems <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, respectively, perform signal processing on video streams with respect to pictures. Thus, the efficiency of time division is not high enough. In addition, in the conventional video decoding systems <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, the period of the decoding synchronization signal may be generated irregularly and the decoded video signal may be displayed irregularly when decoding is performed using a mixed mode of a frame picture and a field picture or using a 3:2 pull-down decoding, for example.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the second channel video decoder <b>1200</b> includes a video stream buffer <b>1210</b>, a variable length decoder <b>1220</b>, a syntax parser <b>1230</b>, a buffer <b>1240</b> and a request controller <b>1250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The video stream buffer <b>1210</b> temporarily stores a second video stream CBS<b>2</b>. The variable length decoder <b>1220</b> performs a variable length decoding on the second video stream CBS<b>2</b> received from the second video stream buffer <b>1210</b> to generate a motion vector, a quantized value and a discrete cosine transformation coefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The syntax parser <b>1230</b> decodes a header information of the second video stream CBS<b>2</b>. Further, the syntax parser <b>1230</b> performs a signal processing on the first motion vector, the first quantized value and the first discrete cosine transformation coefficient to generate the second request signal RQ<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The buffer <b>1240</b> temporarily stores the decoded header information of the second video stream, the motion vector, the quantized value and the discrete cosine transformation coefficient. The request controller <b>1250</b> requests the control of the video signal processor <b>1400</b> from the arbiter <b>1300</b> in response to the second request signal RQ<b>2</b>. Further, the request controller <b>1250</b> informs the syntax parser <b>1230</b> and the buffer <b>1240</b> that the request controller <b>1250</b> requests the control of the video signal processor <b>1400</b> from the arbiter <b>1300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The operation of the second channel video decoder <b>1200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is similar to that of the first channel video decoder <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Therefore, the operation of the second channel video decoder <b>1200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> will not be described in further detail here.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a timing diagram <b>800</b> illustrating an operation of the dual video decoding system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> when decoding is performed using a mixed mode of a frame picture and a field picture.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, VSYNC denotes a vertical synchronization signal, DEC_SYNC_A denotes a decoding synchronization signal for a first channel video signal, and DEC_SYNC_B denotes a decoding synchronization signal for a second channel video signal. Further, A and B denote picture slices for the first channel video signal and the second channel video signal, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As will be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in the decoding system <b>100</b> according to an example of the present disclosure, the first channel video decoder <b>1100</b> and the second channel video decoder <b>1200</b> access the video signal processor <b>1400</b> with respect to slices to perform signal processing. Thus, decoding signals DEC_SYNC_A and DEC_SYNC_B are generated in a regular form when decoding is performed using a mixed mode of a frame picture and a field picture.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When A is 3:2, that is when the first channel video decoder performs a 3:2 pull-down decoding, A is repeated (RA). At this time, the decoding synchronization signal DEC_SYNC_A is not generated. In the same way, when B is 3:2, that is when the second channel video decoder performs a 3:2 pull-down decoding, B is repeated (RB). At this time, the decoding synchronization signal DEC_SYNC_B is not generated.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is a diagram representing a method <b>1000</b> for motion compensation, where request signals MC<b>1</b> to MC<b>4</b> for motion compensation are read one at a time, and response signals S<b>1</b> to S<b>4</b> for motion compensation are generated one at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is a diagram representing a method <b>1050</b> for motion compensation, where request signals MC<b>1</b> to MC<b>4</b> for motion compensation are read at the same time, and response signals S<b>1</b> to S<b>4</b> for motion compensation are generated at the same time.
