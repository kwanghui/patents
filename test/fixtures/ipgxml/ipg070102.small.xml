<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref>, the present invention is adapted to a heavy equipment hydraulic system which includes a plurality of hydraulic pumps P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> and P<b>3</b>, a plurality of control valves C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b> which are switched by a pilot signal pressure Pi and supply an operation oil from the hydraulic pumps P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> and P<b>3</b> to a left and right side traveling motor or work apparatus, and a pilot pump (not shown) which supplies a switching pilot signal pressure to the main control valves C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b>. Since the above construction is the same as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the detailed construction and operation will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, a hydraulic system for a heavy equipment option apparatus according to the present invention includes a straight traveling control valve C<b>4</b> which combines an operation oil from the hydraulic pumps P<b>2</b> and P<b>3</b> when it is switched by a supply of a pilot signal pressure Pi<b>1</b>, supplies to a left and right side traveling motor (not shown) for thereby straight-traveling an equipment and disconnects an operation oil which is supplied from one side hydraulic pump P<b>3</b> to a traveling motor when it is switched by a pilot signal pressure Pi<b>3</b> from the pilot pump P<b>4</b>, and an option apparatus control valve C<b>5</b> which is switched concurrently with the straight traveling control valve C<b>4</b> by a pilot signal pressure Pi<b>3</b> supplied to the straight traveling control valve C<b>4</b> for thereby supplying an operation oil from the hydraulic pump P<b>3</b> to an additional option apparatus A.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the drawings, reference numeral <b>1</b> represents a housing of the option apparatus control valve C<b>5</b>, <b>2</b> represents a spool which is slidably installed in the housing <b>1</b> and controls an operation oil from the hydraulic pump P<b>3</b> to the traveling motor or the option apparatus A, and <b>3</b> represents a spool cap.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The operation of the hydraulic system for a heavy equipment hydraulic system according to the present invention will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, since the inner spool <b>2</b> of the straight traveling control valve C<b>4</b> is in the intermediate mode, an operation oil from the hydraulic pump P<b>3</b> is drained to the hydraulic tank T<b>3</b> or T<b>1</b> (moved in the direction of the arrow).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, in the case that an option apparatus A is additionally engaged to the heavy equipment, as a pilot signal pressure Pi<b>3</b> from the pilot pump P<b>4</b> is supplied to the option apparatus control valve C<b>5</b>, the pilot signal pressure Pi<b>3</b> is supplied from an upper side to a lower side as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the same is supplied to a port of the spool cap <b>3</b>. Since the spool <b>2</b> is switched in the left direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a flowing path of the operation oil drained from the hydraulic pump p<b>3</b> to the hydraulic tank T<b>3</b> is disconnected.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At this time, since an operation oil from the hydraulic pump P<b>3</b> to the traveling motor is disconnected, a straight traveling function is temporarily stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At the same time, a pilot signal pressure Pi<b>3</b> from the pilot pump P<b>4</b> is supplied to the option apparatus control valve C<b>5</b>, and the same is switched in a left or right direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, so that it is possible to rotate the option apparatus A in a left direction or a right direction.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described above, in the case that an option apparatus A such as a braker is engaged to a small size excavator, an operation oil supplied to the option apparatus A is controlled using a conventional straight traveling control valve in a state that a structure of a main control valve which forms a hydraulic system adapted to an equipment is not changed. Therefore, it is possible to decrease a unit cost and a fabrication cost.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an operation oil from the hydraulic pumps P<b>2</b> and P<b>3</b> are combined and supplied to a traveling motor in such a manner that a pilot signal pressure Pi<b>1</b> is supplied to a lower side of the straight traveling control valve C<b>4</b>, and an inner spool is switched in an upward direction, so that it is possible to implement an equipment inherent straight traveling function.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At this time, since a pilot signal pressure Piu<b>3</b> is not supplied to the option apparatus control valve C<b>5</b>, the operation apparatus control valve C<b>5</b> is switched to an intermediate mode (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), so that a supply of the operation oil from the hydraulic pump P<b>3</b> to the option apparatus A is disconnected.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The hydraulic system for a heavy equipment option apparatus according to the present invention has the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the case that an option apparatus is additionally engaged to a small size excavator, it is possible to an operation oil to an additionally engaged option apparatus by changing a structure of a conventional straight traveling valve structure without changing a structure of a control valve assembly, so that it is possible to implement a small size and compact control valve assembly for thereby decreasing a unit cost and fabrication cost.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, a small volume control valve assembly is easily engaged to a small size excavator for thereby enhancing a workability, and an inherent characteristic of a small size equipment is maintained. Therefore, it is possible to maximize a function of an equipment in a narrow work place.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the above-described examples are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the meets and bounds of the claims, or equivalences of such meets and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention is related to a wind-driven power plant (hereafter referred to as a windmill) that is installed floating in deep water, complete with an anchoring to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Previously known technology includes windmills erected on land and windmills erected in near-shore areas. The technique applied is to an essential degree common in that a secure foundation is provided, adapted to the size of the windmill, the dimensioning wind force, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to the previous technology for building windmills in the sea, a foundation extending above the sea surface is erected. An ordinary windmill tower is mounted on the foundation. The machine house of the windmill including the generator, regulating devices, rotor and rotor blades is mounted on the top of this tower. These devices are designed in the same way as for a windmill built on dry land.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">By preference, windmills are erected in places with stable wind conditions. Most often they stand on ridges or they are placed in the flat, open countryside. Thereby they become easily noticeable, and due to their dominating position and tall structure, windmills are often perceived as a visual environmental problem, an alien substance in the nature.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When in use, the windmills develop noise, particularly from the rotor blades. When placed near habitations, the windmills will thus constitute a noise problem for the population.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Wind power is regarded as a &#x201c;green&#x201d; energy type. Wind is an energy source that is always available, and an exploitation of wind as an energy source, is regarded as desirable from an environmental point of view. The production of electric energy by means of windmills does not cause any harmful emissions to nature.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Wind energy cannot be stored, and must therefore be utilized when available. Water, on the other hand, can be stored in magazines. By combining wind-based and hydroelectric power plants in a joint distribution net, it is possible to reduce the water consumption when the wind conditions are favourable. When the windmills cannot be used to produce electric energy, the water-based production is increased. In this way, production systems can be established, that always ensure a maximal exploitation of the wind energy sources, without making the energy supply to the market unstable.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Bt preference, windmills are placed where the average wind force is as high as possible. In this way, the energy production is maximized, and the production cost is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Comprehensive meteorological records show that the average wind force increases when moving from the seashore to the open sea. For example, at the oil installations in the northern part of the North Sea, the average wind velocity is approximately 25% higher than at good windmill locations at the Danish West Coast.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The exploitable wind energy is proportional to the wind velocity raised to the third power. Thus, a 25% increase in the wind velocity represents an increase of the energy potential by 1.25<sup>3</sup>=1.95, i.e. +95%. Placing windmills in the open sea thus gives good conditions for an increased production potential.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is known technology to place small windmills on ships to produce electric energy for captive use.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still, it is not profitable to install large, power producing windmills on ordinary, ship resembling floating installations. The movements of the hull in rough sea will cause very great strain on the structures of the windmills, and the hull has to be of large dimensions in order that the structure can attain sufficient stability to absorb the wind forces acting on the windmill rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The offshore oil production requires large quantities of electric energy. At present, this is by and large provided by means of gas turbines. The combustion of large quantities of gas constitutes a marked environmental problem because carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is emitted to the atmosphere. Great environmental gains can be achieved by substituting environmentally friendly energy production for gas-based production. Therefore, large amounts of money are being invested in establishing transfer cables for electric power from land.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The objective of the present invention is to remedy the disadvantages associated with the previous technique.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with the present invention, this objective is achieved by the features discussed in the description below and in the subsequent patent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A cylindrical tower is kept floating in water in an upright position by means of solid and liquid ballast materials in the lower part of the tower. A windmill with a machine house comprising generator, regulating devices, rotor and rotor blades is placed in the upper part of the tower.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Alternatively, the generator can be placed in the central part of the tower and connected to the rotor axle by means of a suitable transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The total dimensions of the tower are adapted to the size of the windmill, dimensioning wind force and wave height, etc. Since the joint centre of gravity of the structure is below the centre of displaced mass of water, the tower shows a better stability than an ordinary ship hull comprising a corresponding weight of steel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The connection between the machine house and the tower is designed in such a way that the rotor axle of the windmill is maintained in an horizontal position by means of an in itself known regulating device, even if the tower is tilting on one side due to the strain on the various sections of the structure caused by wind, waves and currents in the water.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">By preference, the rotor is placed on the leeward side of the machine house. Thereby, a stabilising effect is achieved on the wind forces that attempt to turn the tower into the wind direction, and the risk that the rotor blades will smash into the tower when it is tilting, is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Alternatively, the generator is placed in the tower. Thereby, complicating devices for lead-through of electric cables to the generator are avoided. A revolving machine house mounted in the upper part of the tower, necessitates transfer from the machine house to the tower by means of sliding contacts, or by limiting the number of revolutions to which the machine house can be subjected before it is revolved in the opposite direction by means of engine power. Sliding contacts can only be used in connection with transfer of relatively small effects. Forced revolution of the machine house is risky if it is carried out when the tower is tilting. In such a situation, the rotor blades can smash into the tower.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The tower is anchored to the bottom of the sea with suitable contrivances. The anchoring of the tower acts as means of both positioning and stabilising. The anchoring system is constructed to prevent the tower from revolving under the influence of torsion forces caused by the rotation of the windmill. Primarily, the anchoring is executed by means of an anchor rod fastened to the sea bottom by means of an anchoring point with a gravitation anchor, a suction anchor or poles and, optionally, secured with filler masses. The anchor rod includes two joints that transfer torsion and tensile forces to the bottom anchoring point but prevent bending strain from acting on the rod. This anchoring system requires little space and is used with advantage if the windmill is placed at or close to a fishing ground.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Alternatively, the windmill can be anchored by means of one or several ordinary bottom anchors. These are connected to outriggers at the tower to absorb the torsion forces.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">During anchoring, the windmill is overloaded with ballast to bring it to sink so deep that, after de-ballasting and independent of tide and waves, there are always tensile forces acting on the anchor/rod connection.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The windmill is connected to an electric power distribution net. By preference, several windmills are placed in the same area in order that the main connection to a remote distribution net can be utilized as efficiently as possible.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the drawings, the reference number <b>1</b> denotes a windmill comprising a cylindrical tower <b>2</b> with a tower bottom <b>3</b>, a ballast room <b>4</b> containing a ballast material <b>5</b> that by preference is a solid, a ballast tank <b>6</b> containing a liquid ballast <b>7</b>, the machine house of the windmill <b>8</b> with rotor axle <b>9</b>, rotor blade <b>10</b>, and, not shown, a generator and regulating devices. The machine house <b>8</b> is hinged to the tower <b>2</b> by means of a tilting joint <b>11</b>. An anchor rod <b>12</b>, complete with the joint <b>13</b>, connects the windmill <b>1</b> to a bottom anchoring <b>14</b> that is secured by a gravitation anchor, suction anchor or poles (not shown) and optionally stabilized by filler masses <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An alternative embodiment of the anchoring system comprises one or several bottom anchors <b>16</b>, complete with anchor chain <b>17</b> and outrigger <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The water surface is denoted by reference number <b>19</b> and the sea bottom by reference number <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The stability of the windmill <b>1</b> is maintained by the centre of gravity of the entire structure being placed significantly lower than the attack point of the buoyant forces of the submerged part of the tower <b>2</b>. This is achieved by a ballast material <b>5</b> being placed in a ballast room <b>4</b> in the lower part of the tower <b>2</b>. By use of an adapted amount of a liquid ballast material, e.g. water, in a ballast tank <b>6</b>, the total ballast weight can be adapted to the weight actually needed to lower the windmill <b>1</b> into the water.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">By means of torsionally rigid anchor connection(s) <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, alternatively <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, to the sea bottom <b>20</b>, the windmill <b>1</b> is kept in position. By temporary overfilling with liquid ballast, resulting in the windmill <b>1</b> being lowered to a greater depth than its calculated permanent depth in the water, the tower is connected to the anchor system <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. By the subsequent removal of water by pumping, a permanent tension is established in the anchor system <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, so that the windmill <b>1</b> remains positioned at a constant depth in relation to the sea bottom <b>20</b>, independent of tide and waves. Thereby, the stability of the windmill <b>1</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The machine house <b>8</b> of the windmill <b>1</b> is placed in the upper part of the tower <b>2</b> and can be revolved in relation to the wind direction in accordance with known technique.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Alternatively, the generator of the windmill <b>1</b> is placed in the central part of the tower <b>2</b>. In this embodiment the stability of the windmill <b>1</b> is increased because the weight of the machine house <b>8</b> is being reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Wind pressure against the rotor blades <b>10</b> of the windmill <b>1</b> and other structures, as well as wave forces and currents in the water, will cause the tower <b>2</b> to tilt to one side. The tilting is balanced by the counteracting resulting force component of the weight of the windmill <b>1</b> and the buoyancy of the windmill <b>1</b> in the water.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">By means of a tilting joint <b>11</b>, complete with an automatic regulating device, the rotor axle <b>9</b> of the windmill <b>1</b> is kept in a horizontal position even when the tower <b>2</b> is tilting. Thereby a greater efficiency is maintained and there will be less strain on the rotor blade <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">During normal operating conditions, the machine house <b>8</b> of the windmill <b>1</b> is turned to a position with the rotor blades <b>10</b> on the leeward side. In this position, the risk that the rotor blades <b>10</b> will smash into the tower <b>2</b> is reduced. At the same time, a stabilizing effect has been achieved on the wind forces that attempt to turn the tower <b>2</b> in the wind direction.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Since, during operation, the rotor axle <b>9</b> is not mounted right-angled to the tower <b>2</b>; a component of this torque will be transferred to the tower. The anchoring system <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, alternatively <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, of the tower <b>2</b> is designed in such a way that it prevents the tower <b>2</b> from being revolved by this torque. The anchor rod <b>12</b> of the primary anchor system complete with the joint <b>13</b> and the bottom anchoring point <b>14</b> is torsionally rigid. At the same time, the joints <b>13</b> prevent bending strain on the rod <b>12</b>. In the same way, the outriggers <b>18</b> of the alternative anchoring system absorb the torsion forces, that are transferred to the bottom anchors <b>16</b> through the anchor chains <b>17</b> that are fastened to the outriggers <b>18</b> far away from the centre axis of the tower <b>2</b>.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a throttle apparatus which has a throttle valve to open and close the intake passage of an engine. More particularly, it relates to a throttle apparatus which includes a mechanism to return the throttle valve to a specific rest position.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As a conventional throttle apparatus which is applied for an engine mounted on an automobile, a wire-cum-electronic controlled type and just an electronic controlled type are known.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, with the conventional wire-cum-electronic controlled type throttle apparatus for a six-cylinder V-type engine, the intake system has two surge tanks collecting three intake passages respectively which correspond to each cylinder and intake passages extending to the upstream side from each surge tank. By coupling two throttle valves disposed at each intake passage of the upstream side with one throttle shaft, and driving to open and close by a wire or a motor, the throttle valves are returned to a rest position at the closing side by a return spring disposed around the throttle shaft, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open H6-207535.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, with a conventional electronic controlled type throttle apparatus, one throttle shaft being free to rotate links the two throttle valves which are respectively disposed at two intake passages which are formed in a throttle body. The open-close drive is performed by a motor which is disposed at one end side of the throttle shaft, and the throttle valves are returned to a rest position at the closing side by a return spring which is disposed at the other side of the throttle shaft, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open H8-218904.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the abovementioned conventional apparatuses, to return the throttle valves to a rest position at the closing side in a state of rest or emergency etc, a torsion type return spring with relatively large urging force is employed. In the normal open-close operation, the urging force of the return spring acts as a drive load to a motor etc. Therefore, the electric power consumption is increased, and the motor is upsized. Further, the apparatus is upsized as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention was devised in view of the problems of the related art. The object of the present invention is to provide a throttle apparatus which performs a rapid return operation in the state of rest or emergency, while smoothly achieving an open-close operation by eliminating return force unneeded for a normal open-close operation which was needed conventionally.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A throttle apparatus of the present invention adopts a structure comprising a throttle valve which is disposed at an intake passage of an engine, a throttle shaft which supports the throttle valve to open and close, a first drive means which includes a motor for rotational driving of the throttle shaft, and a second drive means which exerts return force to the throttle shaft so as to return the throttle valve to a specific rest position.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With this structure, for a normal operation, when the throttle shaft is rotated by the first drive means, the throttle valve performs an open-close operation while rotating between the rest position at the closing side and the full open position. On the other hand, in the state of emergency etc. such as malfunction of the first drive means, the second drive means is activated; either by a driver's switch operation or automatically in the case of an electromagnetic type, and by a driver's hand operation in the case of a hand driven type. Then, the throttle shaft rotates, and returns the throttle valve to the rest position. In this manner, since the second drive means is not activated and does not exert return force during a normal operation, an open-close operation can be performed smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the abovementioned structure, it is possible that the second drive means adopts a structure comprising a pulley which is fixed to the throttle shaft, a wire which is connected along the circumference direction of the pulley, and an electromagnetic solenoid which drives the wire.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With this structure, when the electromagnetic solenoid is activated and pulls the wire, the pulley rotates, and the throttle shaft, namely, the throttle valve rotates at the closing direction to return to the rest position. In this manner, since the second drive means is structured simply by adopting the electromagnetic type, reliability of the apparatus is secured and the apparatus is downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the abovementioned structure, it is possible to adopt a structure comprising an angle detect sensor which detects the angle position of the throttle valve, and a control means which controls the driving of at least the first drive means, and the control means drives the electromagnetic solenoid based on a detect signal from the angle detect sensor and a drive signal of the first drive means.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With this structure, in the case that the control means acknowledges an abnormal state based on the detecting signal from the angle detect sensor and the drive signal of the first drive means, the electromagnetic solenoid is automatically activated despite the driver's recognition and rapidly returns the throttle valve to the rest position.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, in the abovementioned structure, it is possible to adopt a structure that the second drive means comprises a pulley which is fixed to the throttle shaft, a wire which is connected along the circumference direction of the pulley, and a hand-driven operating lever which drives the wire.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">With this structure, when the driver moves the operating lever and pulls the wire, the pulley rotates and the throttle shaft, namely, the throttle valve rotates at the closing side to return to the rest position. In this manner, since the second drive means is structured simply by adopting a hand driven type, reliability of the apparatus is secured and the apparatus is downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the abovementioned structure, the pulley can be disposed at the vicinity to which drive force of the first drive means is exerted.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With this structure, even if the return operation is performed while the drive force of the first drive means is exerted, torsion of the throttle shaft can be prevented because the urging force of the return operation is exerted to compete in the vicinity of the drive force. Particularly, in the case that the throttle shaft is supporting a plurality of throttle valves, synchronization deviation of each throttle valve can be prevented.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The embodiments of the present invention are explained in the following with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> show an embodiment of a throttle apparatus of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a control system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view of the throttle apparatus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side view of an electromagnetic drive means etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the control system comprises an engine <b>1</b>, a four-barrel throttle apparatus <b>2</b> which is mounted on an intake system of the engine <b>1</b>, a drive circuit <b>3</b> for driving a first drive means <b>50</b> which is disposed at the apparatus <b>2</b>, a drive circuit <b>4</b> for driving a second drive means <b>60</b>, an angle detect circuit <b>5</b> for processing signals from an angle detect sensor <b>70</b> which detects the angle position of a throttle valve <b>30</b> of the apparatus <b>2</b>, a revolution sensor <b>6</b> and a revolution speed detect circuit <b>7</b> for detecting revolution speed of the engine <b>1</b>, a water temperature sensor <b>8</b> and a water temperature detect circuit <b>9</b> of the engine <b>1</b>, a memory portion <b>10</b> in which various control information and drive maps etc. are previously stored, a control portion <b>11</b> as a control means to control the whole system, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The apparatus <b>2</b> is a four-barrel throttle apparatus which is applied for an in-line four cylinder engine mounted on a motorcycle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the apparatus <b>2</b> comprises four throttle bodies <b>20</b> which form the intake passages <b>21</b>, four throttle valves <b>30</b> which are disposed at the intake passages <b>21</b>, a throttle shaft <b>40</b> which rotatably supports the four throttle valves <b>30</b> to be opened and closed simultaneously, a first drive means <b>50</b> for rotational driving of the throttle shaft <b>40</b>, a second drive means <b>60</b> for applying return force to return the throttle valves <b>30</b> to a specific rest position, an angle detect sensor <b>70</b> for detecting the rotation angle of the throttle shaft <b>40</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the apparatus <b>2</b> further comprises bearings <b>80</b> to rotatably support the throttle shaft <b>40</b>, spacers <b>90</b> to couple throttle bodies <b>20</b>, connect frames <b>100</b> to connect the four throttle bodies <b>20</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first drive means <b>50</b> is formed by a DC motor <b>51</b> which has a pinion <b>51</b><i>a</i>, a gear <b>52</b> which integrally has a large gear <b>52</b><i>a </i>and a small gear <b>52</b><i>b </i>which intermeshes with the pinion <b>51</b><i>a</i>, a gear <b>53</b> fixed to one end portion of the throttle shaft <b>40</b> while being intermeshed with the gear <b>52</b> (the small gear <b>52</b><i>b</i>), an adjust screw <b>54</b> which restricts the rotating end (namely, the angle position) of the gear <b>53</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When the DC motor <b>51</b> rotates, its rotational drive force is transmitted to the throttle shaft <b>40</b> via the pinion <b>51</b><i>a </i>and the gear train (the gear <b>52</b>, the gear <b>53</b>). Then, the throttle shaft <b>40</b> rotates within a specific rotating angle range, and the throttle valves <b>30</b> perform an open-close operation while rotating within the range between a specific rest position and the full open position.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second drive means <b>60</b> is formed by a pulley <b>61</b> which is fixed to the throttle shaft <b>40</b> at the outside of the gear <b>53</b>, a wire <b>62</b> connected along the circumference direction while being inserted to a slot of the pulley <b>61</b>, a pull-type electromagnetic solenoid <b>63</b> for pull driving of the wire <b>62</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Then, in the case of emergency, when the electromagnetic solenoid <b>63</b> is driven and the throttle valves <b>30</b> are at the full open position, the wire <b>62</b> retracts and the pulley <b>61</b> rotates clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When the gear <b>53</b> contacts to the adjust screw <b>54</b> and stops, the throttle valves <b>30</b> return to the rest position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Namely, in specific cases such as emergency etc, the second drive means <b>60</b> exerts return force to the throttle shaft <b>40</b> only when returning the throttle valves <b>30</b> to the rest position at the closing side. In a normal open-close operation other than mentioned above, the second drive means <b>60</b> is not driven and does not exert return force.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Here, during the open-close operation of the throttle valves <b>30</b> while the gear <b>53</b> is driven, the wire <b>62</b> generates no tension and causes no load. Namely, the wire <b>62</b> is formed so as to be retracted and generate tension only when the solenoid <b>63</b> is operated. For example, when the pulley <b>61</b> positions at the counterclockwise rotation end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, tension is not generated even when the wire <b>62</b> is extended. On the other hand, a mechanism is adopted which allows or absorbs looseness of the wire <b>62</b> when the pulley <b>61</b> positions at the clockwise rotation end.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this manner, since the second drive means <b>60</b> does not exert return force during a normal open-close operation, load affected to the first drive means <b>50</b> is decreased. Therefore, electric power consumption of the DC motor <b>51</b> is decreased. Further, since the structure of the second drive means <b>60</b> is simple by comprising the pulley <b>61</b>, the wire <b>62</b>, the electromagnetic solenoid <b>63</b> and so on, reliability of the apparatus is secured and the apparatus is downsized.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pulley <b>62</b> is disposed in the vicinity of the gear <b>53</b> which transmit drive force. Therefore, even in the state that the DC motor <b>51</b> exerts drive force and the electromagnetic solenoid <b>63</b> is activated to generate return force against the drive force, torsion of the throttle shaft <b>40</b> can be prevented. With this structure, synchronization deviation (namely, respective phase deviation) of a plurality of the throttle valves <b>30</b> which are supported by the throttle shaft <b>40</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, the entire operation of the abovementioned throttle apparatus is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the DC motor <b>51</b> rotates in one direction in accordance with a signal from the control portion <b>11</b>, rotational drive force is transmitted to the throttle shaft <b>40</b> via the gear train (namely, the pinion <b>51</b><i>a</i>, the gear <b>52</b>, and the gear <b>53</b>). Then, the throttle shaft <b>40</b> starts to rotate in one direction, and the throttle valves <b>30</b> rotate from the rest position to the position at which the intake passages <b>21</b> are fully opened.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the contrary, when the DC motor <b>51</b> rotates in the other direction in accordance with a signal from the control portion <b>11</b>, the throttle shaft <b>40</b> rotates in the other direction following the reverse course. Then, the throttle valves <b>30</b> rotate from the full open position to the rest position at which the intake passages <b>21</b> are closed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At a normal drive state, the rotation of the DC motor <b>51</b> is appropriately controlled in accordance with the control mode. Then, the throttle valves <b>30</b> are driven to open and close to be at an appropriate opening. Further, to stop the engine <b>1</b>, the DC motor <b>51</b> stops when the throttle valves <b>30</b> return to the rest position.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this normal operation, the control portion <b>11</b> does not send a drive signal to the second drive means <b>60</b>. Therefore, return force is not generated, and the throttle valves <b>30</b> smoothly perform an open-close operation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">On the other hand, in the case that the apparatus is judged to be at an abnormal state based on a detecting signal from the angle detect sensor <b>70</b> and a drive signal of the first drive means <b>50</b>, for example, in the case that the throttle valves <b>30</b> are not controlled to be at a desired opening, the control portion <b>11</b> sends a drive signal to the second drive means <b>60</b> via the drive circuit <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this manner, the electromagnetic solenoid <b>63</b> operates, and retracts the wire <b>62</b>. Then, the pulley <b>61</b> rotates the throttle shaft <b>40</b> and returns the throttle valves <b>30</b> to the rest position at the closing side. As mentioned above, since the return operation is automatically performed when the control portion <b>11</b> acknowledges an abnormal state despite the driver's recognition, a dangerous state can be avoided. In this case, the on-off control or the duty control etc. can be appropriately selected as the drive condition of the electromagnetic solenoid <b>63</b>. Therefore, time which is needed for the return operation can be freely set, and appropriate conditions can be provided in accordance with the vehicle to which the system is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows another embodiment of a throttle apparatus of the present invention. The same numeral is given to the same structure of the abovementioned embodiment to omit explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the apparatus <b>2</b>&#x2032;, a hand driven type second drive means <b>60</b>&#x2032; is adopted instead of the abovementioned electromagnetically driven second drive means <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Namely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the second drive means <b>60</b>&#x2032; is formed by the pulley <b>61</b> and the wire <b>62</b> which are similar as mentioned above, an operating lever <b>64</b> to pull the wire by a hand operation, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, when the operating lever <b>64</b> is driven in the case of emergency etc. and the throttle valves <b>30</b> are at the full open position, the wire <b>62</b> is pulled and the pulley <b>61</b> rotates clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When the gear <b>53</b> contacts to the adjust screw <b>54</b> and stops, the throttle valves <b>30</b> return to the rest position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Namely, in specific cases such as emergency etc, the second drive means <b>60</b>&#x2032; exerts return force to the throttle shaft <b>40</b> only when returning the throttle valves <b>30</b> to the rest position at the closing side. In a normal open-close operation other than the abovementioned embodiment, unless the driver operates, the return force is not exerted.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Here, during the open-close operation of the throttle valves <b>30</b> while the gear <b>53</b> is driven, the wire <b>62</b> generates no tension and causes no load.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As mentioned above, with the throttle apparatus of the present invention having a throttle shaft to open and close a throttle valve which is disposed at an intake passage of an engine, and a first drive means which includes a motor for rotational driving of the throttle shaft, an electromagnetically driven type or hand driven type second drive means is adopted to exert return force to the throttle shaft when returning the throttle valve to a specific rest position. Since return force is not exerted with a normal operation, an open-close operation can be performed smoothly. Particularly, since load affected to the first drive means is decreased, electric power consumption is decreased. Further, downsizing of the motor and downsizing of the apparatus can be achieved.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the present invention comprises a connector body <b>1</b> having a first passage <b>11</b> and a second passage <b>12</b>, an air release hole <b>13</b>, and a through hole <b>14</b>. The first passage <b>11</b> is interconnected with the second passage <b>12</b>. A thimble <b>15</b> is disposed in the first passage <b>11</b>. The air release hole <b>13</b> and the through hole <b>14</b> are interconnected with the first passage <b>11</b>. A recess <b>16</b> is disposed to the connector body <b>1</b> to accommodate a quick-release wrench <b>17</b> therein. A magnetized member (or a magnetic member) <b>161</b> is disposed in the recess <b>16</b>. The quick-release wrench <b>17</b> has a fastener <b>171</b> and a magnetic member (or a magnetized member) <b>172</b>. The quick-release wrench <b>17</b> corresponds to the through hole <b>14</b> of the connector body <b>1</b> for securing purpose through the fastener <b>171</b>. The magnetized member <b>161</b> of the recess <b>16</b> is magnetized to the magnetic member <b>172</b> of the quick-release wrench <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">The connector body <b>1</b> is assembled to a seat block <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. A pressure end <b>173</b> of the quick-release wrench <b>17</b> engages with and urges the thimble <b>15</b> towards a post <b>211</b> of a valve <b>21</b> of the seat block <b>2</b>. This forces the post <b>211</b> to slide. Whereas the first passage <b>11</b> of the connector body <b>1</b> and the seat block <b>2</b> have produced a gap in between and air pressure may be forced from there and into a pressure pipe A and a pressure gauge B provided on the second passage <b>12</b>. Because the thimble <b>15</b> is urged by the quick-release wrench <b>17</b>, a worm ring <b>151</b> on the thimble <b>15</b> will slide away from the air release hole <b>13</b>, thus air can not be released from the air release hole <b>13</b> and remains in the second passage <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">To release the remaining air, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the quick-release wrench <b>17</b> is turned to disengage the magnetic member <b>172</b> from the magnetized member <b>161</b>, which moves the pressure end <b>173</b> of the quick-release wrench <b>17</b> away from the thimble <b>15</b>. An elastic element <b>152</b> of the thimble <b>15</b> pushes the thimble <b>15</b> back to its original position, which forms a gap between the worm ring <b>151</b> of the thimble <b>15</b> and the air release hole <b>13</b>, thus the remaining air in the pressure gauge B of the second passage <b>12</b> will be released through the air release hole <b>13</b> so as to balance the pressure of the outside and the connector body <b>1</b>. Thus the pressure pipe A can be separated. The gap between a blocking edge <b>153</b> of the thimble <b>15</b> and a blocking wall <b>111</b> of the first passage <b>11</b> may be placed with washers to adjust the extending length of the thimble <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">When the present invention is incorporated with a paintball gun C and an air tank D, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the seat block <b>2</b> is secured to the air tank D and adapted to connect with the connector body <b>1</b>. The quick-release wrench <b>17</b> is forced so that the magnetic member <b>172</b> is magnetized with the magnetized member <b>161</b> of the recess <b>16</b>. The pressure end <b>173</b> engages with the thimble <b>15</b> and urges the thimble <b>15</b> to move toward the post <b>211</b>, which links the post <b>211</b> of the valve <b>21</b> to slide simultaneously. Whereas the thimble <b>15</b> blocks the air release hole <b>13</b>, air from the air tank D is allowed to flow to the second passage <b>12</b> of the connector body <b>1</b>. Upon the usage is completed, the quick-release wrench <b>17</b> is turned so that the pressure end <b>173</b> of the quick-release wrench <b>17</b> disengages from the thimble <b>15</b>, which brings the thimble <b>15</b> back to its original position. The worm ring <b>151</b> of the thimble <b>15</b> corresponds to the air release hole <b>13</b> to form a gap, thus the remaining air in the pressure gauge B of the second passage <b>12</b> will be released through the air release hole <b>13</b> to balance the air pressure of both inside and outside of the connector body <b>1</b>. It is easy to detach the pressure pipe A, preventing any air explosion, when changing the paintball gun C.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">A gap is formed between the blocking edge <b>153</b> of the thimble <b>15</b> and the blocking wall <b>111</b> of the first passage <b>11</b> for replacing the air tank D. In any event that a replaced air tank has a different size, the valve <b>21</b> in the seat block <b>2</b> may be varied, the gap from above allows the user to insert washers so as to adjust the extending length of the thimble <b>15</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of machinery and methods for the application of a circumferential band to a container, and more particularly to such machinery and methods in which the band is formed of a tubular film supplied in flat condition.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Bands, and their counterparts, i.e. tubular labels, are used commonly for indicating the seal integrity of a container and for enhancing product packaging, respectively. In both the application of bands and tubular labels, a length of flat tubular thin-walled material is severed to form a cut sleeve, and the cut sleeve is placed over the container. If the purpose of the cut sleeve is to indicate whether the container has been opened after being initially sealed, the cut sleeve is relatively short and referred to as a band. If the cut sleeve is intended to cover a major portion of the container, the cut sleeve is relatively long and referred to as a label. Such bands and labels are typically formed from extruded or welded thermoplastic resin tubes, for example polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyethylene (PE). In many cases, the plastic tubes are pre-stretched radially so that they can be readily placed over a container and subsequently shrunk when subjected to heat.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A known machine for providing and applying bands to containers is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,305,578 entitled Heat-Shrinkable Band Application Machine and incorporated herein by reference. The machine described in this '578 patent performs the desired functions by advancing a length of film tubing, grasping an end portion of the film tube with angularly oriented suction cups, cutting the length of film tube from the supply, expanding the angularly held cut sleeve into a position offset from the film tube supply and releasing the suction cups as a plunger descends to push the cut sleeve onto a container being moved by a conveyor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides an apparatus and method for mounting a band or label onto a container in a simplified and more efficient process. A selected length of flat film tube is advanced from a tubing supply, the length is held between a pair of opposed suction cups and severed from the tubing supply. The suction cups separate to open the cut length forming a rounded configuration in axial alignment with the tubing supply. When a product container is detected to be approaching a sleeve mounting position, the vacuum is released and a further length of flat film tube is advanced to push the opened cut sleeve onto the container. This process is repeated sequentially as additional containers are moved into position for receiving cut sleeves.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a diagrammatic side view illustrates an apparatus for mounting heat-shrinkable bands onto containers. Thin-wall film tubing <b>12</b> is provided from a supply reel (not shown) and passes between a pair of drive rollers <b>20</b> and past a cutter comprising movable blade <b>24</b>, stationary shear block <b>28</b> and actuator <b>26</b>. The angular orientation of film tube <b>12</b> with respect to a container <b>40</b> will be discussed below. In the section above drive rollers <b>20</b>, film tube <b>12</b> is in flattened condition on the supply reel (not shown) and passes over a spreader, for example the spreader described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/789,216 entitled Tubular Banding Apparatus And Method, incorporated herein by reference. Thus, film tube <b>12</b> is shown reducing from a wide aspect above drive rollers <b>20</b> to a narrow aspect at and below drive rollers <b>20</b>, whereas in both conditions film tube <b>12</b> is flat in mutually perpendicular planes. Drive rollers <b>20</b> are rotated intermittently in the directions indicated by arrows A by a drive motor (not shown) to cause film tube <b>12</b> to move downward in the direction indicated by arrow B. The length of film tube <b>12</b> to be advanced by each operative cycle of drive rollers <b>20</b> is variable according to the process parameters. Film tube <b>12</b> is guided in a straight path from drive rollers <b>20</b> to a position between a pair of grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>by being passed through a channel formed by shear block <b>28</b> and a guide <b>30</b> residing parallel to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A first gripper <b>32</b><i>a, </i>for example a suction cup, is assembled to the end of a rod of a first actuator <b>34</b><i>a, </i>for example a pneumatic cylinder. A second gripper <b>32</b><i>b </i>is assembled to a second actuator <b>34</b><i>b. </i>Actuators <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>are mounted in axial alignment with one another with grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>positioned respectively on either side of the path of film tube <b>12</b>. Actuator <b>34</b><i>a </i>and actuator <b>34</b><i>b </i>are extendable to achieve contact between grippers <b>32</b><i>a, </i><b>32</b><i>b </i>and film tube <b>12</b>. The descriptive term &#x201c;suction cup&#x201d; is used here for explanatory reasons, and is not to be construed as a limitation on the scope of the invention. For a purpose to be described below, a first vacuum supply hose <b>36</b><i>a </i>is connected to gripper <b>32</b><i>a </i>and a second vacuum supply hose <b>36</b><i>b </i>is connected to gripper <b>32</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A cutter for film tube <b>12</b> consists of movable blade <b>24</b> that is mounted on the cylinder rod of blade actuator <b>26</b> and a stationary blade, for example shear block <b>28</b>. Blade <b>24</b> and shear block <b>28</b> are mounted on opposite sides of film tube <b>12</b> at a location below drive rollers <b>20</b> and above grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b. </i>When actuator <b>26</b> extends blade <b>24</b>, blade <b>24</b> passes in shearing contact with shear block <b>28</b> to sever a length of film tube <b>12</b> from the film tubing supply.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An exemplary container <b>40</b>, in a series of similar containers, is transported along conveyor <b>42</b> in the direction indicated by arrow C to pass a band applying point in alignment with the lower end of film tube <b>12</b>. A sensor <b>44</b>, for example a photosensitive cell, is mounted above conveyor <b>42</b> and below the end of film tube <b>12</b> in a position to sense the approach of container <b>40</b> to the band applying point at which a cut length of film tube <b>12</b> will be mounted onto container <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a selected length of film tube <b>12</b> is advanced and the lower end thereof is positioned between grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b, </i>as described above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>extend and blade <b>24</b> cuts film tube <b>12</b> to form cut sleeve <b>16</b>. In this manner, the lower end of film tube <b>12</b> is firmly held in position between grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>while film tube <b>12</b> is cut from the tubing supply to form flat cut sleeve <b>16</b>. Grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>hold cut sleeve <b>16</b> in substantial alignment with film tube <b>12</b>. During this time frame, container <b>40</b> has been moving incrementally along on conveyor <b>42</b> in the direction indicated by arrow C.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, blade actuator <b>26</b> retracts to reposition blade <b>24</b> out of the downward path of film tube <b>12</b> and a negative pressure, or vacuum, is applied through hose <b>36</b><i>a </i>and hose <b>36</b><i>b </i>to enable grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>to securely maintain their hold on opposed sides of cut sleeve <b>16</b>. Next, actuators <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>are reversed, resulting in the separation of grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b, </i>opening cut sleeve <b>16</b> to a round, or near-round, configuration, as viewed from above (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>move apart equally so as to maintain axial alignment between flat film tube <b>12</b> and open sleeve <b>16</b>. Grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>maintain their respective positions as exemplary container <b>40</b> has been moving still farther along on conveyor <b>42</b> to a position impinging the target area of sensor <b>44</b>. The movements of film tube <b>12</b>, grippers <b>32</b><i>a, </i><b>32</b><i>b </i>and movable blade <b>24</b> are deactivated until a subsequent cycle is initiated. At the point that sensor <b>44</b> detects the position of container <b>40</b> on conveyor <b>42</b>, sensor <b>44</b> transmits a signal to a controller (not shown). By computing the time at which container <b>40</b> will have moved from the position at which it was detected by sensor <b>44</b> to a position for receiving cut sleeve <b>16</b>, the controller initiates a further cycle of the invention banding apparatus to occur, placing cut sleeve <b>16</b> onto container <b>40</b>. Conveyor <b>42</b> moves container <b>40</b> along its path continuously without interruption.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the controller causes cut sleeve <b>16</b> to be assembled onto container <b>40</b> by causing drive rollers <b>20</b> to rotate a further increment in the direction of arrows A to extend an additional selected length of film tube <b>12</b> between guide <b>30</b> and shear block <b>28</b> to contact cut sleeve <b>16</b>. The downward movement of film tube <b>12</b> releases open cut sleeve <b>16</b> from being suspended between grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b, </i>pushing cut sleeve <b>16</b> onto the neck of container <b>40</b> as conveyor <b>42</b> continuously moves container <b>40</b> therealong. Optionally, the vacuum applied to grippers <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>is deactivated in coordination with the movement of a subsequent length of flat tube <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a top view taken in the direction of line <b>5</b>&#x2014;<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, clearly shows that the layflat width L of film tube <b>12</b> is greater than the diameter D of open cut sleeve <b>16</b>. When film tube <b>12</b> is extended into contact with open cut sleeve <b>16</b>, open cut sleeve <b>16</b> is moved onto container <b>40</b>. Suction cups <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>remain in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, with extended film tube <b>12</b> therebetween for repeating the cutting, opening and assembling steps described above. Additional containers, similar to exemplary container <b>40</b>, are conveyed in spaced apart relation by conveyor <b>42</b> in a series, each container triggering the apparatus of the invention to discharge a cut sleeve onto the triggering container, forming and opening another cut sleeve as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The mechanism that comprises the invention, drive rollers <b>20</b>, cutter <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and grippers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, is oriented so that film tube <b>12</b>, and more particularly cut sleeve <b>16</b>, is presented at an angle &#x3b1; to the orientation of container <b>40</b> directed toward a band applying position. The band applying position coordinates the conveyed position of container <b>40</b> with the discharging of cut sleeve <b>16</b>. This angular relation between film tube <b>12</b> and container <b>40</b> optimizes the accuracy and improves the speed of mounting cut sleeve <b>16</b> on container <b>40</b> by placing the right end (as illustrated) of cut sleeve <b>16</b> onto the leading edge of the container, allowing the left end to drop into place as container <b>40</b> continues to move in the direction of arrow C. Film tube <b>12</b> preferably resides at an angle &#x3b1; of less than 90&#xb0; above horizontal and more preferably between 65&#xb0; and 85&#xb0; above horizontal, most preferably about 75&#xb0; above horizontal. In addition, actuators <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>reside in perpendicular relation to film tube <b>12</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to avoid these known drawbacks of the prior art and to further develop a process and an installation for the steel grades in accordance with the preamble of the independent claims, in such a manner that it is possible to produce a corresponding steel strip more economically.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0008">According to the invention, this object is achieved by a process and installation having the features of the independent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0009">According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the casting rolls referred to are the casting rolls used in a two-roll casting process. In addition, however, the term casting roll by definition also encompasses all other shaping wall surfaces which are known from the prior art. According to the prior art, the surface of a casting roll is preferably produced by a process engineering technique which involves material-removing machining, in particular by turning and/or grinding. During the production of strips using the casting rolls which are known from the prior art, in particular in accordance with the two-roll casting process, and with RSF values of between 100 N/mm and 250 N/mm (roll separating force) which are customary in the prior art, the strips produced, in addition to significant evidence of cracking, also show evidence of very considerable temperature differences across the strip width and along the strip length, from which considerable fluctuations in forces and uneven solidification characteristics can be inferred.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0010">During the direct casting of non-stainless (Cr and/or Ni content in each case below 1%) liquid steel to form thin strips with a thickness of between 1 and 10 mm, use of the process parameters which are known from the prior art therefore produces a steel strip of inadequate quality. In this context, microcracks which are frequently formed on the strip are particularly critical.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0011">The procedure described in the present invention has for the first time made it possible, with the abovementioned composition of the steel melt, to produce a crack-free strip with a good strip profile, in particular a good strip crown. Furthermore, it is possible to achieve a strip temperature across the width of the strip which is more homogeneous than in the prior art even just below the permanent mold or casting rolls, in particular within a strip width, of &#xb1;25 K. The strip produced using the process according to the invention does not generally have any thermally induced diagonal streaks and is distinguished by a good quality of its edges.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0012">According to a particular embodiment of the invention, there are two casting rolls for operating a two-roll casting process, in which case recesses which are distributed in a random pattern uniformly over the casting roll surface are arranged on the surfaces of both casting rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0013">According to a particular embodiment of the present invention, the surface structure of the casting roll used is characterized by substantially uniformly distributed recesses. According to one particular embodiment, these recesses are indentations and/or protuberances, produced mechanically, for example, in the surface of the casting roll, with a height distance of 3 to 80 micrometers, in particular from 20 to 40 micrometers, being set between the rim, in particular the burr, and the deepest point of a recess.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, between 1 and 20 recesses per mm<sup>2 </sup>of the casting roll surface area are arranged on the casting roll surface in a random pattern, distributed uniformly over the casting roll surface.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">As tests have shown, this inventive measure makes it possible to produce a particularly high-quality surface of the steel strip.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the Si content of the steel melt is set to less than 0.35% by weight of Si.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0017">As tests have shown, this inventive measure makes it possible to produce a steel strip with particularly high-quality mechanical properties, in particular with an improved toughness.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0018">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the at least partially solidified casting strip is taken off the casting rolls at a rate of more than 30 m/min.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">In practice, it has been found that this inventive measure makes it possible to realize a particularly high-quality surface, combined at the same time with improved process economics. At lower rates, overflows and the formation of creases in the strip surface (often associated with surface cracks) are observed with increasing regularity.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the roughness average of the surface of at least one of the casting rolls is set to more than 3 &#x3bc;m, with the stochastic distribution of the recesses being effected by a mechanical treatment of the casting roll surface, in particular by shot peening.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the mechanical treatment of the casting roll surface is carried out by shot peening using shot with a target diameter D in the range from 0.5 mm to 2.2 mm, with from 1 to 250 individual pieces of shot per mm<sup>2 </sup>of surface area striking the region of the surface which is subjected to the shot peening during this operation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the pieces of shot used for shot peening deviate from the abovementioned target diameter D at most by a maximum standard deviation of 30%.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the liquid steel meniscus (=casting level) is oriented at an angle of between 30&#xb0; and 50&#xb0; from the geometric kissing point, i.e. the radii running from the casting roll axis on the one hand horizontally towards the geometric kissing point and on the other hand towards the meniscus include a steel bath contact angle of 30&#xb0;&#x2013;50&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the melt reservoir is laterally delimited by the two casting rolls and by suitable side plates and is at least partially covered at the top by a suitable covering, so that it is substantially protected from the ingress of media which do not form part of the process, in particular dust-containing air and/or oxidizing gases.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the melt reservoir is exposed to a substantially inert atmosphere, the inert gas supplied being formed by 0&#x2013;100% by volume of N<sub>2</sub>, remainder argon or another ideal gas or CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">According to a particular embodiment of the process according to the invention, the inert gas supplied contains up to 7% of H<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">According to a particular embodiment, the space between the melt reservoir and the upper cover is at least partially filled or purged by a gas which is substantially inert with respect to the steel melt.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the inert atmosphere applied to the melt reservoir, in terms of its oxygen content, is limited to a maximum O<sub>2 </sub>content of 0.05% by volume.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the crown of the casting strip and the edge drop are determined at a measuring section at the exit from the casting rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">The strip crown and the edge drop are defined in accordance with DIN standards.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">According to one embodiment of the process according to the invention, the casting rolls are subjected to preliminary cold-profiling in such a manner that

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The following disclosure relates generally to aircraft stowage compartments and, more particularly, to overhead stowage bin systems in aircraft passenger cabins.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aircraft passenger cabins generally include some form of overhead stowage bins that allow passengers to stow their carry-on luggage during a flight. The overhead stowage bins are typically arranged to include outboard stowage bins positioned on the left and right sides of a passenger cabin directly above the outboard seats. In multi-aisle aircraft, inboard stowage bins typically are positioned above the center seats. The stowage bins are often pivotally mounted to fixed support structures to be easily opened and closed by passengers. The outboard and inboard stowage bins are positioned to avoid interfering with the seat aisles through the passenger cabin, while allowing the passengers to open the bins and stow or remove their luggage when standing in the aisles adjacent to their seats.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Commercial airplanes typically have multiple passenger cabins with seats in a variety of seat-row arrangements to serve passengers with different requirements and fare potentials. For example, a business class or first class cabin typically will have a 2-2-2 seat-row arrangement, wherein there are two outboard seats on the left side of the fuselage, two center seats, and two outboard seats on the right side of the fuselage. The same aircraft also often has an economy class cabin with a 2-4-2 seat-row arrangement, wherein there are two left outboard seats, four center seats, and two right outboard seats. An economy class passenger cabin could have other seating configurations, such as a 3-2-3 seat-row arrangement, wherein there are three left outboard seats, two center seats, and three right outboard seats. The outboard seats in these different seating configurations are spaced laterally apart from the center seats to provide elongated aisles extending longitudinally through the passenger cabins. The aisles for each of the different seat-row arrangements typically are different widths or are in different lateral positions relative to the longitudinal centerline of the fuselage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional passenger aircraft of a common model typically have common stowage bin systems within the passenger cabins. The stowage bin systems typically have outboard and inboard stowage bins installed in a single, fixed configuration within the passenger cabin. The outboard and inboard stowage bins are spaced apart from each other so as to define one or more longitudinal overhead aisles through the passenger cabin.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional overhead aisles, known as composite aisles, are designed to be wide enough so that any conventional seating configuration can be installed and so the seat aisles between the seats will be positioned below the composite aisles. For example, the same composite overhead aisle(s) is used in each aircraft independent of whether the seats are arranged in a 1-2-1 seat-row arrangement, 2-2-2 seat-row arrangement, a 2-4-2 seat-row arrangement, a 2-5-2 seat-row arrangement, a 3-2-3 seat-row arrangement, or other seat-row arrangements. The result of using a wide composite aisle, however, include loosing the ability to use some of the overhead space for stowage. Insufficient overhead stowage space can be a source of dissatisfaction for passengers, thereby detracting from the passengers' overall flying experience.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In conventional aircraft having a single-aisle seating arrangement, the passenger cabin typically is configured with a 2-2 seat-row arrangement (two seats on each side of the seat aisle), or a 2-3 seat-row arrangement (two seats on one side of the seat aisle and three seats on the other side). The overhead stowage bin systems used with the single-aisle seating arrangement typically are configured with a composite aisle that can accommodate both the 2-2 and 2-3 seat-row arrangements. In at least one conventional aircraft configured with a 2-3 seat-row arrangement, the overhead stowage bin system provides standard stowage bins, which are suitable for both the 2-3 and the 2-2 seat-row arrangements, over the set of two outboard seats, and larger stowage bins over the set of three outboard seats. The combination of larger and standard stowage bins on opposite sides of the overhead aisle provides for greater overhead stowage capacity as compared to the stowage capacity in a stowage bin system for a 2-2 seat-row arrangement. The increased overhead stowage capacity, however, typically requires a trade off with versatility to rearrange the passenger cabin with a different seat-row arrangement, such as the 2-2 seat-row arrangement.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of embodiments of the invention are directed to modular stowage bin systems. One embodiment provides an overhead stowage bin system for use in an aircraft fuselage. The system includes first and second stowage bins coupleable to the fuselage. The second stowage bin has storage capacity different than a storage capacity of the first stowage bin.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first and second stowage bins are configurable in first and second configurations. In the first configuration, the first and second stowage bins are laterally spaced apart from each other with a first overhead aisle therebetween. The first overhead aisle has first opposing edge portions spaced laterally apart from each other and from the sidewall portion of the fuselage. The first and second stowage bins in the second configuration are laterally spaced apart from each other with a second overhead aisle therebetween. The second overhead aisle has second opposing edge portions shifted laterally in the same direction relative to the position of the first opposing edge portions of the first overhead aisle when the first and second stowage bins are in the first configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the invention includes a method of reconfiguring an interior of an aircraft fuselage. The method includes removing first stowage bin modules in a first configuration from a first bin support coupled to the aircraft fuselage. The first stowage bin modules have a first storage capacity. The method also includes removing second stowage bin modules in the first configuration from a second bin support coupled to the aircraft fuselage. The second stowage bin modules have a second capacity different than the first capacity. The second stowage bin modules in the first configuration are spaced laterally apart from the first stowage bin modules. A first overhead aisle is positioned between the first and second stowage bin modules, and the first overhead aisle has first opposing edge portions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method also includes attaching a plurality of first stowage bin modules to the second bin support in a second configuration, and attaching the plurality of second stowage bin modules to the first bin support in the second configuration. The second stowage bin modules are spaced laterally apart from the plurality of the first stowage bin modules. A second overhead aisle is positioned between the first and second stowage bin modules, and the second overhead aisle has second opposing edge portions shifted laterally in the same direction relative to the position of the first opposing edge portions of the first overhead aisle in the first configuration.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following disclosure describes modular overhead stowage bin systems for use in an aircraft passenger cabin having a plurality of different seating configurations. Certain specific details are set forth in the following description and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1&#x2013;4</figref> to provide a thorough understanding of various aspects and embodiments of the invention. Other details describing the well-known structures and systems often associated with aircraft and, more specifically, with aircraft fuselages, stowage bins, and passenger seats, are not set forth in the following description to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description of the various embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Many of the details, dimensions, and other specifications shown in the figures are merely illustrative of particular embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, other embodiments can have other details, dimensions, and specifications without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. In addition, other embodiments of the invention may be practiced without several of the details described below.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a top isometric view of an aircraft <b>10</b> with a fuselage <b>12</b> (shown partially cut away) that contains a passenger cabin <b>14</b>. A plurality of passenger seats <b>16</b> are arranged in a selected configuration in the passenger cabin <b>14</b>. An overhead stowage bin system <b>18</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is positioned over the seats <b>16</b>. The stowage bin system <b>18</b> is a modular, reconfigurable system that can be easily and economically reconfigured to provide different stowage bin arrangements to best accommodate different seating configurations in the passenger cabin <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged partial cross-sectional view of the fuselage <b>12</b> taken substantially along line A&#x2014;A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing the passenger cabin <b>14</b> with the stowage bin system <b>18</b> in a first configuration above the seats <b>16</b>. In this illustrated embodiment, the fuselage <b>12</b> has sidewall portions <b>20</b> and curved sidewall panels <b>21</b> coupled to the sidewall portions outboard of the seats <b>16</b>. Ceiling panels <b>22</b> are coupled to the fuselage <b>12</b> below a central portion <b>23</b> of the fuselage. The ceiling panels <b>22</b> generally extend between upper portions of the sidewall panels <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A floor structure <b>24</b> is coupled to the fuselage <b>12</b> and extends between the sidewall panels <b>21</b>. The seats <b>16</b> are removably anchored to the floor <b>24</b> in a selected seating configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, the seats <b>16</b> are arranged in a 2-4-2 seat-row arrangement, with two left outboard seats <b>26</b> adjacent to the sidewall panels <b>21</b> on the left side of the fuselage <b>12</b>, two right outboard seats <b>28</b> adjacent to the sidewall panels on the right side of the fuselage, and four center seats <b>30</b> between the right and left outboard seats. In another embodiment, the seats can be arranged in a 2-5-2 seat-row arrangement. The 2-4-2 and 2-5-2 seat-row arrangements are typical seating configurations used for an economy class passenger cabin <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The center seats <b>30</b> are spaced apart from the left, outboard seats <b>26</b> to define a left seat aisle <b>32</b>, and the center seats are spaced apart from the right outboard seats <b>28</b> to define a right seat aisle <b>34</b>. The left and right seat aisles <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are each sized to meet or exceed Federal Aviation Regulations to provide clear pathways extending longitudinally through the passenger cabin <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The stowage bin system <b>18</b> is positioned over the seats <b>16</b> in a manner that provides reconfigurable overhead aisles above the left and right seat aisles. In the illustrated embodiment, the stowage bin system <b>18</b> includes outboard bin supports <b>36</b> coupled to the fuselage <b>12</b> generally above the left and right outboard seats <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. The stowage bin system <b>18</b> also includes a center bin support <b>38</b> coupled to the fuselage <b>12</b> and positioned generally above the center seats <b>30</b>. Each of the outboard and center bin supports <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are configured to removably retain modular overhead stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b>. The outboard and center bin supports <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> in one embodiment include elongated, generally horizontal, frame-like structures. In other embodiments, the outboard and center bin supports <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> include a plurality of connection members securely attached to structural supports that define portions of the fuselage.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b> connected to the outboard bin supports <b>36</b> are referred to herein as outboard stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>a</i>, and the stowage bin assemblies connected to the center bin support <b>38</b> are referred to herein as center stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>b</i>. The outboard stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>a </i>are laterally spaced apart from the center stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>b </i>to define two overhead aisles <b>50</b> generally above the left and right seat aisles <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, as discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The bin assemblies <b>40</b> of the illustrated embodiment include two differently sized bin modules, namely, large bin modules <b>42</b> and small bin modules <b>44</b>. Each of the large and small bin modules <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are interchangeably connectable to the outboard bin supports <b>36</b> and to the center bin support <b>38</b>. The positions of the large and small bin modules <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> in the passenger cabin depend, in part, upon the seating arrangements. Accordingly, the outboard stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>a </i>can include either the large bin modules <b>42</b>, the small bin modules <b>44</b>, or both. Similarly, the center stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>b </i>can include either the large bin modules <b>42</b>, the small bin modules <b>44</b>, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each of the large and small bin modules <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> can include a bin bucket <b>46</b> that defines a stowage capacity. The small bin modules <b>44</b> have bin buckets <b>46</b> with smaller stowage capacities than the stowage capacities in the bin buckets of the large bin modules <b>42</b>. The large and small bin modules <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are configured to allow the bin buckets <b>46</b> to pivot relative to the outboard or center bin supports <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> between open and closed positions. When the large and small bin modules <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are in the open position, passengers can place luggage or other articles into the bin bucket <b>46</b> for overhead storage above the seats <b>16</b>. When the large and small bin modules <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are in the closed position, they are latched closed so the contents are securely and safely retained until the bin modules are unlatched and moved back to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the seats <b>16</b> are arranged in a 2-4-2 seat-row configuration, and a plurality of the small bin modules <b>44</b> are connected to the outboard bin supports <b>36</b> above the left and right outboard seats <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. A plurality of the large bin modules <b>42</b> are connected to the center bin support <b>38</b> above the center seats <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the outboard stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>a </i>include the small bin modules <b>44</b>, and the inboard stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>b </i>include the large bin modules <b>42</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, pairs of the large bin modules <b>42</b> are provided along the center bin support <b>38</b>, with the large bin modules in each pair facing outwardly in opposite directions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The overhead aisles <b>50</b> in the illustrated embodiment extend longitudinally through the fuselage <b>12</b> between the outboard bin modules <b>40</b><i>a </i>and the inboard bin modules <b>40</b><i>b</i>. Each overhead aisle <b>50</b> has an aisle centerline <b>51</b>, an outboard edge portion <b>52</b> defined at least approximately by the faces of the small bin modules <b>44</b> and an inboard edge portion <b>54</b> defined at least approximately by the faces of the large bin modules <b>42</b>. The width of each overhead aisle <b>50</b> between the outboard and inboard edge portions <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> is aligned to function for the 2-4-2 seat-row arrangement to provide adequate space for passenger ingress and egress along the left and right seat aisles <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> without overhead interference. The width of each overhead aisle <b>50</b> in the illustrated embodiment is also suitable for use with a 1-2-1 and a 2-5-2 seat-row arrangement. The overhead aisle <b>50</b> is sized to allow enough space for movement of luggage or other articles into or out of the outboard and inboard stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an enlarged partial cross-sectional view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> but with the stowage bin system <b>18</b> shown in a second configuration. The seats <b>16</b> are positioned in the 3-2-3 seat-row arrangement, which defines the left and right seat aisles <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> between the center seats <b>30</b> and each of the left and right outboard seats <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. The lateral position of the left and right seat aisles <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> is shifted inboard as compared to the lateral position of the left and right seat aisles in the first configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), wherein the seats <b>16</b> are positioned in the 2-4-2 seat-row arrangement, as described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this second configuration, the outboard stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>a </i>include a plurality of the large bin modules <b>42</b> connected to the outboard bin supports <b>36</b> above the left and right outboard seats <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. The inboard stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>b </i>include a plurality of the small bin modules <b>44</b> attached to the center bin support <b>38</b> above the center seats <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the positions of the large and small bin modules <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> in this embodiment are reversed from the first configuration discussed above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The large and small bin modules <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are laterally spaced apart to define overhead aisles <b>60</b> above the left and right seat aisles <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. Each overhead aisle <b>60</b> has an aisle centerline <b>61</b>, an outboard edge portion <b>62</b> defined at least approximately by the faces of the outboard large bin modules <b>42</b>, and an inboard edge portion <b>64</b> defined at least approximately by the faces of the inboard small bin modules <b>44</b>. The width of the overhead aisles <b>60</b> in this second configuration is at least approximately the same as the width of the overhead aisles <b>50</b> in the first configuration described above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The position of the overhead aisles <b>60</b>, however, are shifted laterally in the inboard direction as compared to the position of the overhead aisles <b>50</b> in the first configuration. Accordingly, the position of the aisle centerline <b>51</b> in the first configuration shifts laterally to the position of the aisle centerline <b>61</b> in the second configuration. Similarly, both the outboard and inboard edge portions <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> move laterally in the same direction (e.g. inboard) as compared to the position of the corresponding outboard and inboard edge portions <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> of the overhead aisles <b>50</b> in the first configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The lateral shift of each overhead aisle <b>60</b> generally corresponds to the lateral shift of the left and right seat aisles <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> that occurred when the seating configuration is changed from the 2-4-2 or 2-5-2 seat-row arrangement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the 3-2-3 seat-row arrangement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) or a 3-3-3 seat-row arrangement. Accordingly, the stowage bin system <b>18</b> provides for reconfiguration of the modular bin assemblies <b>40</b> to provide overhead aisles in different lateral positions and/or different sizes to accommodate different seating configurations without requiring a single &#x201c;composite aisle&#x201d; for all seating arrangements. As a result, the amount of overhead stowage space for use by the passengers can be higher than it is for conventional arrangements, even when the seating configuration in the passenger cabin <b>14</b> is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The stowage bin system <b>18</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has the large bin modules <b>42</b> outboard over the outboard seats <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> and the small bin modules <b>44</b> inboard over the center seats <b>30</b> in the 3-2-3 seat-row arrangement. The dimensions and range of motion of the large and small bin modules <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> in the illustrated embodiment are optimized so the resulting overhead aisles <b>60</b> between the large and small bin modules are in positions also well-suited for seats <b>16</b> configured in a 2-1-2, 2-2-2, or 3-3-3 seat-row arrangement. Accordingly, the configuration of the stowage bin system <b>18</b> does not need to change for every different seating arrangement, while still being able to provide ample available overhead storage in the passenger cabin <b>14</b> for the passengers and crew.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the configurations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>have bin modules <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> of only two different sizes. In other embodiments, the stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>can have interchangeable bin modules with more than two different sizes that can connect to the outboard and center bin supports <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. In one embodiment, the stowage bin system <b>18</b> in the first configuration has a first set of small bin modules <b>44</b> positioned over the left and right outboard seats <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, and a first set of large bin modules <b>42</b> positioned over the center seats <b>30</b>. In the second configuration, a second set of small bin modules <b>44</b> are positioned over the center seats <b>30</b>, and a second set of large bin modules <b>42</b> are positioned over the left and right outboard seats <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. Each of the first and second sets of small bin modules <b>44</b> can include different bin modules not used in the other set. In another embodiment, some or all of the small bin modules <b>44</b> in the first set can be included in the second set of small bin modules. Similarly, each of the first and second sets of large bin modules <b>42</b> can include different bin modules not used in the other set. In another embodiment, some or all of the large bin modules <b>42</b> in the first set can be included in the second set of large bin modules. The interchangeability of the stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>on the outboard and center bin supports <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> provides significant flexibility to accommodate the overhead stowage needs associated with different seating arrangements in the passenger cabin <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the stowage bin system <b>18</b> is not limited to the space that would have been required for a &#x201c;composite aisle&#x201d; to accommodate all of the seating configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As indicated above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the stowage bin system <b>18</b> can be configured with the small bin modules <b>44</b> over the center seats <b>30</b> when the seats <b>16</b> are arranged in a 2-2-2 seat-row arrangement. The stowage bin system <b>18</b> also can have other configurations for the same seating arrangements. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged partial cross-sectional view of the aircraft <b>10</b> with the stowage bin system <b>18</b> in an alternate configuration. The seats <b>16</b> in the passenger cabin <b>14</b> are arranged in the 2-2-2 seat-row arrangement, as is typical for a business class or first class passenger cabin. The stowage bin system <b>18</b> can be configured with a plurality of the large bin modules <b>42</b> connected only to the outboard bin supports <b>36</b>. No stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b> are attached to the center bin support <b>38</b>, which results in a passenger cabin <b>14</b> with a very open and spacious feeling while still providing sufficient overhead stowage capacity. The modularity of the stowage bin system <b>18</b> provides the ability to use only the outboard stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>a </i>and to eliminate the use of the inboard stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b><i>b</i>, thereby reducing the weight of the aircraft <b>10</b> and the cost of equipment installation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The modularity of the stowage bin system <b>18</b> allows for additional stowage bin assemblies <b>40</b> to be easily installed along the center bin support <b>38</b>, for example, when a first class cabin is converted to a business class cabin by providing more rows of seats in the 2-2-2 seat-row arrangement. If the seating arrangement is changed from the 2-2-2 seat-row arrangement to, as an example, the 24-2, the 2-5-2, the 3-2-3, or the 3-3-3 seat-row arrangement, the modularity of the stowage bin system <b>18</b> allows the large and small bin modules <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> to be easily removed and repositioned to desired locations on the outboard or center bin supports <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. As an example, a variety of the modular stowage bin assemblies can be used and can have different longitudinal dimensions while still being able to plug into selected positions along the outboard and center bin supports. Accordingly, the invention is not limited, except as by the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">It is important to learn, develop and reefing basic strategy skills, especially as relate to situational variables. As such skills are acquired and mastered, it becomes possible to formulate and test increasingly complex stratagems, such as those relating to planning and anticipating competitive gambits, revising ongoing strategies to accommodate changing variable parameters, and maximizing opportunities as they manifest themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One way of acquiring and honing such skills is through the playing of educational card games that make the learning process fun and entertaining. Game systems developed toward this end include U.S. Pat. No. 821,781 to Cadwallader issued May 29, 1906; U.S. Pat. No. 977,117 to McPherson issued on Nov. 20, 1910; U.S. Pat. No. 1,034,402 to Hardy issued Jul. 30, 1912; U.S. Des. Pat. No. D45,670 to Kearney issued Apr. 28, 1914; U.S. Pat. No. 1,551,761 to McCarroll issued on May 23, 1924; U.S. Pat. No. 1,568,206 issued on Jan. 5, 1926 to Brandt; and U.S. Pat. No. 1,681,683 issued on May 4, 1927 to Ramer. However, none of these card games effectively combine the teaching of strategy involving changing variables with a readily comprehendible and entertaining rule hierarchy. Thus, there is a need for an educational card game and system for playing said game that lends itself to teaching strategies dealing with changing variables. The present invention addresses this need.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention and presenting its currently understood best mode of operation, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, with such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1&#x2013;4D</figref> illustrate a first embodiment of the present invention. A card deck <b>10</b> is shown, preferably consisting of twenty-four playing cards <b>12</b>. Each card <b>12</b> is preferably bifurcated so as to have a first face portion <b>14</b> and a second face portion <b>16</b> occupying the same front face side <b>18</b> of the card <b>12</b>. The first and second portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are preferably equal in size, shape and area and are from time to time referred to herein for convenience as the &#x2018;top&#x2019; and &#x2018;bottom&#x2019; portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, even though rotating the card <b>12</b> one-hundred and eighty (180) degrees will reverse the &#x2018;top&#x2019; and &#x2018;bottom&#x2019; positions. The back side <b>19</b> of each card <b>12</b> (positioned opposite the front side <b>18</b>) is preferably identical to the back side <b>19</b> of every other card <b>12</b>. While the above embodiment deck <b>10</b> is described as having twenty-four bifurcated cards <b>12</b>, alternate embodiments may have other numbers of likewise bifurcated cards, such as, for example, fifty-two cards.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022">The first and second portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of each respective card <b>12</b> are preferably marked with respective suit and alphanumeric rank designations as are commonly found in a pinochle deck (i.e., 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace in the suits of Spades, Diamonds, Hearts and Clubs). It should be noted that while traditional suits are used in the exemplary preferred embodiment, the invention is not limited to the above-mentioned suits and any other convenient, non-traditional combination of suit designations may be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">Preferably, the deck <b>10</b> includes four six-card series <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. Each respective series <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> includes six cards <b>12</b>, each respective card <b>12</b> having a first suit-rank pairing <b>28</b> appearing on the first portion <b>14</b> and a second, different suit-rank pairing <b>30</b> appearing on the second portion <b>16</b>. More preferably, the top and bottom portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> respectively include corner markings or pips to denote the suit-rank paring appearing on the opposite portion <b>16</b>, <b>14</b>, such that a player holding a plurality of cards in his hand may be able to determine the suit-rank designations appearing on the bottom portions <b>16</b> without having to physically rotate each card <b>12</b> or otherwise flip his cards <b>12</b> over.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">Each series <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> preferably includes a unique pairing of red and black suits. Specifically, the first series <b>20</b> is preferably characterized by cards <b>12</b> having Spades on the top portions <b>14</b> and Diamonds on the bottom portions <b>16</b>. Likewise, the second series <b>22</b> is preferably characterized by cards <b>12</b> having Spades on the top portions <b>14</b> and Hearts on the bottom portions <b>16</b>, while the third and fourth series <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are characterized by cards <b>12</b> having Clubs on the top portions <b>14</b> and, respectively, Diamonds and Hearts on the bottom portions <b>16</b>. Also preferably, each series includes cards having the alphanumeric designations Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten and Nine adorning both the top and bottom portions <b>4</b>, <b>16</b>. (As used herein, the term alphanumeric designation primarily refers to the above-listed word designations and their abbreviations [i.e., A, K, Q, J, 10 and 9] as well as to the commonly used pictorial designations for the King, Queen and Jack). Preferably, each card includes two different alphanumeric designations, such as a first designation on the top portion <b>14</b>, and a different second designation on the bottom portion <b>16</b>. More preferably, the highest designation (A) is paired with the lowest designation (9), the second-highest designation (K) is paired with the second-lowest designation (10), and the third- and fourth-highest designations (Q and J) are paired as they appear on the cards <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">Thus, the twenty-four cards <b>12</b> in the deck <b>10</b> are designated as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">The first series <b>20</b> of six cards is marked with the following top and bottom portion <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> designations: Ace of Spades and Nine of Hearts, King of Spades and Ten of Hearts, Queen of Spades and Jack of Hearts, Jack of Spades and Queen of Hearts, Ten of Spades and King of Hearts, Nine of Spades and Ace of Hearts;</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">the second series <b>22</b> of six cards is marked with the following top and bottom portion <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> designations: Ace of Clubs and Nine of Hearts, King of Clubs and Ten of Hearts, Queen of Clubs and Jack of Hearts, Jack of Clubs and Queen of Hearts, Ten of Clubs and King of Hearts, Nine of Clubs and Ace of Hearts;</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028">the third series <b>24</b> of six cards is marked with the following top and bottom portion <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> designations: Ace of Spades and Nine of Diamonds, King of Spades and Ten of Diamonds, Queen of Spades and Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Spades and Queen of Diamonds, Ten of Spades and King of Diamonds, Nine of Spades and Ace of Diamonds;</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">and the fourth series of six cards is marked with the following top and bottom portion <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> designations: Ace of Clubs and Nine of Diamonds, King of Clubs and Ten of Diamonds, Queen of Clubs and Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Clubs and Queen of Diamonds, Ten of Clubs and King of Diamonds, Nine of Clubs and Ace of Diamonds.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">METHODS OF PLAY</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">The above-described deck <b>10</b> embodiment of the game system may be used to play a card game involving two teams having two players each. The teams are chosen and the players are preferably seated such that no two team members are seated adjacent each other. A deck <b>12</b> is shuffled, and the cards are randomly and evenly distributed (i.e., dealt) to each player. Thus, each player should have six cards <b>12</b> in his hand immediately after dealing. Each player reviews his hand and, based on the distribution of cards therein</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Bidding:</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">Players sequentially bid based on the number of tricks each respective player believes his hand will enable his team to take during play (as described in detail below). A bid may take the form of a pass, or a bid may be a number selected from the set of integer values from one to six and paired with either a suit (as a potential trump suit designation) or a &#x2018;no-trump&#x2019; designation. Preferably, the no-trump designation may be either high or low no-trump. Bidding continues sequentially until the maximum numerical value of six is bid or until no one raises the numerical value of the bid (i.e., until the bid passes around back to the high bidder). The high bidder names trump for the remainder of the hand based on the content of his high bid.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">For example, if the high his bid was Four Spades, for example, then Spades will be considered trump by all players during that hand and the value of the Spades will be trump value. This means the Spades and the two Jacks of Clubs will be trump cards and ranked in the following order; J<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, J<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, J<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003" he="3.56mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00002.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, J<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004" he="3.56mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00002.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, A<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00005" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, A<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00006" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, K<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00007" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, K<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00008" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, Q<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00009" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, Q<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00010" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, 10<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00011" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, 10<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00012" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, 9<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00013" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, 9<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00014" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>. This means that there are fourteen cards available to be trump. All of the cards in the other suits will be valued from high to low value; Ace, King, Queen, Jack, (except Clubs because they become Trumps in this particular bid), Ten and Nine, during the play of this hand.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Trump and Card Rank Hierarchy:</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">During play, the cards are ranked as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">Trump suit: a suit that is named in the winning bid and therefore all of the cards of that suit will be of greater value than any card of any other suit during the play of that hand. Trump cards <b>12</b> are always higher ranked than non-trump cards <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">No-trump: all suits are considered equal and the value of a card is simply determined by its number value. No-trump may be played from high cards to low (High no-trump) or in the reverse (low no-trump). The high or low must be named during the bid process prior to play; if not, the default is high no-trump.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">If a suit is named trump during play, the cards <b>12</b> are ranked in descending order as follows: Jack of the trump suit, Jack of the same colored non-trump suit, Ace, King, Queen, Ten and Nine of the trump suit. For example, if spades were trump, the trump suit would be given as follows (in descending order): J<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00015" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, J<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00016" he="3.56mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00002.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, A<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00017" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, K<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00018" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, Q<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00019" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, 10<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00020" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, 9<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00021" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>. A hand with J<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00022" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, J<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00023" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, J<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00024" he="3.56mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00002.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, A<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00025" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, K<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00026" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, 9&#x2666; would likely deserve a bid of 5 or 6, depending upon the degree of risk the player is comfortable with. For a bid of 6, the player would be gambling that his partner would take at least one trick.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">The values in the High No-Trump range in descending value from Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Nine of the same suit and in the reverse order in Low No-Trump. All suits are equal during play in No-Trump. For example, the hand of A<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00027" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, A<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00028" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, K<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00029" he="2.12mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, A<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00030" he="3.56mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00002.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>, K<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00031" he="3.56mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US07156398-20070102-P00002.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> would reasonably support a 4 or 5 bid.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">Since there are two faces on each card <b>12</b>, each suit-rank combination appears twice in the deck. Cards <b>12</b> having portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> with the same suit and value (i.e., the Ace of Spades) are of equal rank. Thus, the first card <b>12</b> played on a trick is valued as the highest and therefore wins the trick even if the same suit-rank combination is later played by another player, wherein a trick is all the cards played in a single round, one from each player. This is a strategic point for a player to keep in mind while trying to formulate his intended bid because there are effectively two of every card in the deck and he may only have one of those.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">A player must always follow suit before he can trump, therefore he may be forced to play a card which the top half he had relied upon when making his bid but, later becomes the only card in his hand in which the other end is a match to the suit that has just been led. Since the player must follow suit first during play, he thus loses his higher valued card. The same is true for his partner and opponents; thus, it is important to pay attention to not only the end <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the card <b>12</b> played in response to the suit led, but also to the other end <b>16</b>, <b>14</b> not currently used in play. This nuance causes the player to continuously revise his strategy as the game is played,</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Play of the Game:</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">The player that made the final and highest bid will begin play by leading the first card of the six tricks that are to follow. He places his first card <b>12</b> on the table with the end <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> he intends the card <b>12</b> to be valued by facing the center. Each player to his left in turn will place a card <b>12</b> on the table in the same manner. The players must first follow suit if they can and the first highest ranked card <b>12</b> played will win the trick.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">If a player cannot follow suit (because he does not have a card with either end <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> displaying the suit that was led), he may then play any card <b>12</b> of his choice and that card <b>12</b> may be a trump card <b>12</b>. If a suit was named as trump during the bid, then the highest trump card <b>12</b> played first wins the trick. The player that wins the trick wins the right to lead the next trick and may play any card <b>12</b> remaining in his hand.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">Play follows in this manner until the team that won the bid reaches or exceeds the bid in number of tricks won or does not reach their bid when there are no cards <b>12</b> remaining to be played.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Scoring:</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">If the players that won the bid reach or exceed their bid they get 1 point for each trick taken. If the opposing players win enough tricks that the bidding team cannot attain their bid, then the opposing players get 1 point for every trick they got and the bidding team's score is reduced by the total amount of their original bid. Play continues until one team reaches a predetermined number of points, such as 31 points.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Variations:</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">In one variation, if a player cannot follow suit (because he does not have a card with either end <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> displaying the suit that was led), he must play trump if trump is present in his hand. If the player has no trump, he may then play any remaining card <b>12</b> of his choice.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">In another variation, while no points are gained by a team not making their bid, there is likewise no subtractive is no penalty for not making the bid.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">In still another variation, if the players that won the bid reach or exceed their bid they get 1 point for each trick taken. The opposing players likewise get one point for every trick taken. If the opposing players win enough tricks that the bidding team cannot attain their bid, then the bidding team's score is reduced by the total amount of their original bid.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character. It is understood that the embodiments have been shown and described in the foregoing specification in satisfaction of the best mode and enablement requirements. It is understood that one of ordinary skill in the art could readily make a nigh-infinite number of insubstantial changes and modifications to the above-described embodiments and that it would be impractical to attempt to describe all such embodiment variations in the present specification.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a spigotted shooting pot piston incorporated within the body of a shooting pot cylinder of a coinjection hot runner assembly in an injection molding machine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Coinjection molding is typically used to mold multi-layered plastic packaging articles having a laminated wall structure. Each layer is typically passed through a different annular or circular passageway in a single nozzle structure and each layer is partially, sequentially, injected through the same gate. Some coinjection hot runner systems include shooting pots to meter material of one plastic resin so that each cavity of a multi-cavity mold receives an accurate dose of that resin in the molding cycle. Some design configurations use check valves to prevent backflow of the resin when the shooting pot discharges the resin through the nozzle. See also:</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. Pat. No. 4,717,324 to Schad teaches a coinjection hot runner system including shooting pots that use rotary valves to prevent backflow. Check valves, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,710,118 to Krishnakumar may be preferable to rotary valves to reduce leakage problems, reduce cost, and save space in the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Often, such check valves become blocked or jammed with plastic resin, disrupting normal operations of the mold. In particular, the moving element of the check valve (typically a ball or the like) may pick up degraded, partially solidified resin debris, foreign matter, or carbonized resin, that can act like an adhesive, causing the moving element to stick to the check valve chamber wall in the open or partially open position. This allows resin to flow back into the melt inlet channel, and causes a short shot to be injected into the mold resulting in a defective part. There may be other causes for the moving element to stick in the open position, such as a deformed moving element, particles in the resin, improper injection pressure, etc. Moreover, the resin flow around the ball often does not generate enough pressure to displace it. This disfunction may block the check valve ball movement during injection. Thus, blockage problems with check valves remain to be solved.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">1. Introduction</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention will now be described with respect to several embodiments in which a spigotted shooting pot piston is used with a check valve in a plastic resin, multi-layer, co-injection molding machine.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a portion of a coinjection hot runner assembly. A shooting pot assembly <b>10</b> is shown mounted in a &#x201c;C&#x201d; resin hot runner manifold <b>11</b>. It comprises a shooting pot cylinder <b>12</b>, a shooting pot piston <b>13</b>, a ball check valve <b>14</b>, plug <b>15</b>, and a seal <b>16</b>. Preferably, the check valve assembly (comprising the ball <b>14</b> and the check valve chamber <b>29</b>) is disposed wholly or partially within (integral with), or immediately adjacent to the shooting pot cylinder <b>12</b>. Resin is supplied to the shooting pot cylinder <b>12</b> via an inlet melt channel <b>17</b> and leaves the shooting pot en route to the nozzle assembly <b>9</b> via an outlet melt channel <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The check valve <b>14</b> is used to control the flow of the resin from the inlet melt channel <b>17</b> to the shooting pot cylinder <b>12</b> when metering, and from the shooting pot cylinder <b>12</b> to the nozzle <b>9</b> during injection. As noted above, in some cases the check valve occlusion (e.g., a ball) <b>14</b> jams or sticks in the open position and does not come back to the closed position so that when the shooting pot piston <b>13</b> advances to discharge the contents of the shooting pot cylinder <b>12</b>, the check valve <b>14</b> does not close promptly, thereby allowing resin to flow backwards into the inlet melt channel <b>17</b> of the hot runner manifold <b>11</b>. Consequently, a reduced amount of resin is injected into the mold cavity causing improper dosing and defective molded parts.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">2. The First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show a first embodiment according to the present invention. In particular, a short, cylindrically shaped spigot extension (or dislodging structure) <b>20</b> is coaxially disposed at the distal end of the cylindrical shooting pot piston <b>13</b>, opposite the proximal end. The spigot extension <b>20</b> is preferably of a one-piece construction (integral) with the shooting pot piston <b>13</b>, but may comprise a different material which is bolted, glued, soldered, or otherwise affixed to the distal end of the shooting pot piston <b>13</b>. Preferably, the spigot extension <b>20</b> has a cylindrical shape that is longitudinally shorter than, and has a smaller external diameter than, the shooting pot piston <b>13</b>. The spigot extension <b>20</b> external diameter allows it to pass freely inside the transition channel <b>22</b> from the cylinder to the check valve chamber (ball housing) <b>29</b>. Axial grooves <b>21</b> are provided to allow any backflow of the resin when the spigot enters the transition channel <b>22</b>. Preferably, the spigot extension <b>20</b> has a smaller external diameter than the check valve ball <b>14</b>. As one example, the shooting pot piston <b>13</b> and the spigot extension <b>20</b> are an integral piece made of H-13 steel. The shooting pot piston is 70 mm long with an external diameter of 10 mm. The spigot extension <b>20</b> is 6 mm long with an external diameter of 4 mm. Of course, the shape, size, and dimensions of the shooting pot piston <b>13</b> and the spigot extension <b>20</b> may be varied depending upon the material being molded and the method of molding adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In operation, the moving element (ball <b>14</b>) of the check valve can be dislodged mechanically toward the end of each injection cycle, thereby reducing and/or preventing jamming or sticking of the moving element. At each cycle, as the shooting pot piston advances down the shooting pot cylinder <b>12</b>, the spigot extension <b>20</b> moves the ball <b>14</b>, if it has not yet moved by the force of the flowing melt. Since the spigot extension <b>20</b> has an external diameter smaller than that of the shooting pot piston <b>13</b>, as the shooting pot piston advances, resin melt may flow around the spigot extension <b>20</b> and into the outlet melt channel <b>19</b>. The longitudinally-extending slots or channels <b>21</b> allow the melt to pass freely along its sides when flowing into or out of the shooting pot when the extension <b>20</b> enters the opening <b>22</b> of the check valve chamber <b>29</b>. The length of the spigot extension <b>20</b> is designed such that the ball <b>14</b> can be physically moved before the absolute end of the discharge cycle, so that minimal melt will flow back into the inlet melt channel <b>17</b> during the next cycle.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">3. The Second Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an alternate embodiment in which the check valve moving element comprises a shaped insert <b>30</b>, which has a conically-shaped distal end to allow the incoming melt to flow into the check valve chamber <b>33</b> more easily that the surface of a check valve ball. Preferably, the shaped insert <b>30</b> has side slots <b>31</b> which are deep enough to allow incoming resin to pass through the shaped insert <b>30</b>, but shallow enough to prevent backflow during the injection stroke of the piston <b>32</b>. For example the dimensions of the shaped insert <b>30</b> and its slots <b>31</b> are 9 mm long, 8 mm in diameter with slots 1 mm deep.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">4. Conclusion</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thus, what has been described is a method and apparatus for reducing and/or eliminating the jamming or blockage of a check valve in the shooting pot of an injection molding machine.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The individual components shown in outline or designated by blocks in the attached Drawings are all well-known in the injection molding arts, and their specific construction and operation are not critical to the operation or best mode for carrying out the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the present invention has been described with respect to what is presently considered to be the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. To the contrary, the invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">Piracetam and related pyrrolidine compounds have been shown to improve memory and cognitive learning ability in healthy subjects. Additionally, these compounds appear effective in individuals who have suffered memory or cognitive impairment associated with neuronal conditions or disorders often caused by traumatic brain injury. GABA agonist side effects such as memory loss are also limited by piracetam and/or related pyrrolidine adjunct therapies. This class of compounds has met with limited acceptance in the United States owing to difficulties in administering a form suited to cross the blood brain barrier as well as concerns about piracetam and related pyrrolidine compounds depleting synaptic acetylcholine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Thus, there exists a need for an improved composition for systemic and/or intrathecal delivery of piracetam and its analogs.</p>

<br/>
where R<sup>1</sup>&#x2013;R<sup>5 </sup>are as previously described is reacted with a transporter amine.
</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">According to the present invention, a piracetam or piracetam analog conjugate compound is formed to a species known to traverse the blood brain barrier either through diffusion or a specific transporter. While the specific transport mechanism is unclear, owing to the small molecular weight and lack of steric hindrance associated with gamma-aminobutyramide, inhibitory affects on the transporter species associated with conjugation are limited.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0020">In a preferred embodiment, an inventive conjugate compound includes a transporter moiety R<sup>6 </sup>having a privileged ability to pass the blood brain barrier and thereafter be cleaved from a piracetam or piracetam analog component to itself form an active therapeutic or neurochemistry equilibrium modifier. The ability to deliver as a conjugate a piracetam or piracetam analog with a second neuroactive species provides a previously unavailable ability to moderate a neurological therapeutic effect. As neuroactive compounds are subject to complex feedback mechanisms, the successful transport of a compound across the blood brain barrier has a moderated therapeutic effect owing to neurochemistry equilibrium shifts in response to the compound traversing the barrier. An inventive conjugate provides piracetam or piracetam analog that upon cleavage from the transporter moiety R<sup>6 </sup>is in proximity to a second neurologically active species that has an agonistic, antagonistic, or independently operating neuroactive species. The piracetam or piracetam analog and moiety R<sup>6 </sup>after cleavage being subject to further enzymatic modification and/or efflux clearance. It is appreciated that two or more inventive conjugates are amenable to simultaneous delivery in order to provide still more refined therapeutic affects.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021">An inventive conjugate compound is preferably formed through an amide linkage between a piracetam or piracetam analog ester or carboxylic acid and a primary or secondary aminated blood brain barrier transporter compound. Aminated blood brain barrier transporter compounds operative herein illustratively include serotonin, blood brain barrier (BBB) peptide, membrane translocating peptide, dopamine, transferrin, TAT peptides, bradykinin, beta-endorphin, bombesin, calcitonin, cholecystokinin, an enkephalin, dynorphin, insulin, gastrin, substance P, neurotensin, glucagon, secretin, somatostatin, motilin, vasopressin, oxytocin, prolactin, thyrotropin, an angiotensin, galanin, neuropeptide Y, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropnin-releasing hormone, growth hormone-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, vasoactive intestinal peptidegluconate, aminated glucose, aminated L-lactate, L-leucine, L-glutamate, aminated saccharin and aminated choline. The aminated or phosphorylated transporter compound is reacted with a piracetam or piracetam analog ester or carboxylic acid, the pyrrolidine amide having a nitrogen substituent that is able to cross the blood brain barrier transporter. Alternatively a pyrrolidine acid chloride is conjugated to a blood brain barrier transporter compound. Preferably a pyrrolidine amine is reacted with a blood brain transporter compound ester.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">Carbodiimides are zero length cross-linkers that mediate the formation of an amide or phosphoramidate linkage between a carboxylate and an amine, or a phosphate and an amine, respectively. Chu, B., Kramer, F. &#x26; Orgel, L. (1986), &#x201c;Synthesis of an amplifiable reporter RNA for bioassays,&#x201d; Nucleic Acids Research, 14, 5591&#x2013;5603. Hoare, D. &#x26; Koshland, D. E. (1966) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 88, 2057. Carbodiimides react with carboxylic acids to form highly reactive O-acylisourea compounds that are very short lived but react with nucleophiles to form an amide bond. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) is representative of a reactive carbodiimide. This reaction works effectively between pH 4.5 and 7.5. Molecules with a phosphate group such as the 5&#x2032; phosphate on oligonucleotides can also react with amine-containing groups by using the carbodiimide reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">Optionally, a linker species is provided intermediate between the transporter moiety R<sup>6 </sup>and the aminobutyramide portion of an inventive conjugate. The linker in simplest form includes a moiety reactive with the pendant carbonyl carbon of the piracetam or piracetam analog precursor and a second moiety reactive with the transporter compound. Substituents extending from a linker are provided to modify the lipophilicity of an inventive conjugate, or tether a dye or spectroscopic marker. With the inclusion of a linker, care should be taken to limit both the molecular weight and the hydrophilicity of the linker in order to retain the ability to traverse the blood brain barrier. Typically, the linker has eight or less backbone carbon atoms. Preferably, the linker backbone is linked to the piracetam or piracetam analog amido portion of an inventive conjugate compound through an oxygen atom or a carbon atom. The linker moiety reactive with the piracetam or piracetam analog portion carbonyl carbon illustratively form an amide and an ester linkage. Transporter compound reactive moiety of the linker is dependent upon the transporter compound moiety to be bound thereto. Suitable chemistries for a variety of potential reaction moieties are found in <i>Comprehensive Organic Transformations</i>, R. C. Larock, John Wiley &#x26; Sons 1999.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">It is appreciated that a linker, when present, is the preferred site for the attachment of an additional species. A substituent is optionally provided pendent from the linker backbone. The substituent illustratively includes a radioactive atom, a magnetic spectroscopically active marker and an organic dye. A radioactive atom is alternatively operative as a marker in isotope studies such as positron emission tomography, single photon emission computer tomography, radiological studies and the like. Common radio-isotopes used in medical imaging illustratively include <sup>123</sup>I, <sup>99m</sup>Tc, and other chelated radioisotopes as detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,241,963. Spectroscopically active markers include NMR/MRI active contrast enhancing moieties known to the art such as gadolinium, as detailed in Contrast Agents 1: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Topics in Current Chemistry, 221) by Werner Krause, Springer Verlag, Berlin, Germany. Organic dyes, while recognized to have potentially distinct NMR/MRI signatures, are provided to yield an optically active spectroscopic signature suitable for biopsy, surgical identification, or preclinical studies of tissue treated by an inventive compound.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">Optionally, an inventive conjugate is administered in combination with acetylcholine or an acylglycerophosphocholine as provided in U.S. Pat. No. 4,355,027 to counter the propensity of piracetam and piracetam analogs to deplete neural acetylcholine. Acetylcholine depletion is considered especially problematic over a prolonged therapeutic regime.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">Compositions suitable for injection optionally include physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, glycerol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert customary excipient (or carrier) such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate or (a) fillers or extenders, as for example, starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, (b) binders, as for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alignates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and acacia, (c) humectants, as for example, glycerol, (d) disintegrating agents, as for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain complex silicates, and sodium carbonate, (e) solution retarders, as for example, paraffin, (f) absorption accelerators, as for example, quaternary ammonium compounds, (g) wetting agents, as for example, cetyl alcohol, and glycerol monostearate, (h) adsorbents, as for example, kaolin and bentonite, and (i) lubricants, as for example, talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, or mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethyleneglycols, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">Solid dosage forms such as tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and others well known in the art. They may contain opacifying agents, and can also be of such composition that they release the active compound or compounds in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used are polymeric substances and waxes. The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031">The enteric coating is typically a polymeric material. Preferred enteric coating materials have the characteristics of being bioerodible, gradually hydrolyzable and/or gradually water-soluble polymers. The amount of coating material applied to a solid dosage generally dictates the time interval between ingestion and drug release. A coating is applied with to a thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below 5 associated with stomach acids, yet dissolves above pH 5 in the small intestine environment. It is expected that any anionic polymer exhibiting a pH-dependent solubility profile is readily used as an enteric coating in the practice of the present invention to achieve delivery of the active to the lower gastrointestinal tract. The selection of the specific enteric coating material depends on properties such as resistance to disintegration in the stomach; impermeability to gastric fluids and active agent diffusion while in the stomach; ability to dissapate at the target intestine site; physical and chemical stability during storage; non-toxicity; and ease of application.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032">Suitable enteric coating materials illustratively includecellulosic polymers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyhnethyl cellulose succinate and carboxymethylcellulose sodium; acrylic acid polymers and copolymers, preferably formed from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, ammonio methylacrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and/or ethyl; vinyl polymers and copolymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, vinylacetate crotonic acid copolymer, and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers; shellac; and combinations thereof. A particularly preferred enteric coating material for use herein are those acrylic acid polymers and copolymers available under the tradename EUDRAGIT&#xae;, Roehm Pharma (Germany). The EUDRAGIT&#xae; series L, L-30D and S copolymers are most preferred since these are insoluble in stomach and dissolve in the intestine.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033">The enteric coating provides for controlled release of the active agent, such that release is accomplished at a predictable location in the lower intestinal tract below the point at which drug release would occur absent the enteric coating. The enteric coating also prevents exposure of the active agent and carrier to the epithelial and mucosal tissue of the buccal cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and stomach, and to the enzymes associated with these tissues. The enteric coating therefore helps to protect the active agent and a patient's internal tissue from any adverse event prior to drug release at the desired site of delivery. Furthermore, the coated solid dosages of the present invention allow optimization of drug absorption, active agent protection, and safety. Multiple enteric coatings targeted to release the active agent at various regions in the lower gastrointestinal tract would enable even more effective and sustained improved delivery throughout the lower gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034">The enteric coating optionally contains a plasticizer to prevent the formation of pores and cracks that allow the penetration of the gastric fluids into the solid dosage. Suitable plasticizers illustratively include, triethyl citrate (Citroflex 2), triacetin (glyceryl triacetate), acetyl triethyl citrate (Citroflec A2), Carbowax 400 (polyethylene glycol 400), diethyl phthalate, tributyl citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, glycerol, fatty acid esters, propylene glycol, and dibutyl phthalate. In particular, a coating composed of an anionic carboxylic acrylic polymer typically contains approximately 10% to 25% by weight of a plasticizer, particularly dibutyl phthalate, polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate and triacetin. The coating can also contain other coating excipients such as detackifiers, antifoaming agents, lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate), and stabilizers (e.g., hydroxypropylcellulose, acids and bases) to solubilize or disperse the coating material, and to improve coating performance and the coated product.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">The enteric coating is applied to a solid dosage using conventional coating methods and equipment. For example, an enteric coating can be applied to a solid dosage using a coating pan, an airless spray technique, fluidized bed coating equipment, or the like. Detailed information concerning materials, equipment and processes for preparing coated dosage forms may be found in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, eds. Lieberman et al. (New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1989), and in Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 6.sup.th Ed. (Media, Pa.: Williams &#x26; Wilkins, 1995).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0036">Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, as for example, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propyleneglycol, 1,3-butyleneglycol, dimethylformamide, oils, in particular, cottonseed oil, groundnut oil, corn germ oil, olive oil, castor oil and sesame oil, glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethyleneglycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan or mixtures of these substances, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0037">Besides such inert diluents, the composition can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents, as for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">An inventive compound is also delivered in conjunction with an active therapeutic compound. The therapeutic compound illustratively being active as antibiotic, a gamma or beta radiation emitting species, an anti-inflammatory, an antitumoral, an antiviral, an antibody, a hormone, an enzyme, and antigenic peptide or protein.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a method for preparing organoclays for use in clay/polymer nanocomposites. More particularly, the invention relates to methods for the surface modification of clays to provide solid-state compatibility between the organoclay and semi-crystalline polymers like the polyolefins and waxes.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the late 1980s a great deal of research around the world has focused on developing methods to incorporate fully exfoliated smectite clays into polymers to increase mechanical and barrier properties. The typical approach relies on organoclay technology developed by Jordan in the 1950s, wherein the clay surface is treated to render it compatible with hydrophobic materials like the polyolefins and waxes. This surface treatment consists of an adsorbed monolayer of a high-molecular-weight quaternary amine, such as dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow amine. The surfactant adsorption takes place via an ion-exchange reaction involving the negatively charged basal surface of the clay platelets.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The simple mechanism by which the organoclays can improve barrier properties relies on the high aspect ratio of the exfoliated clay platelets to impart a tortuous path that retards the transport of diffusing species like oxygen or water vapor. In a strictly tortuous path mechanism, all diffusing species would be retarded to the same degree. The tortuousity factor can be as high as several-hundred-fold for impermeable platelets with aspect ratios of 100&#x2013;500 and at modest mineral loadings of 5&#x2013;10 volume percent. Unfortunately, nanocomposite performance has not always lived up to expectations, and barrier improvements of two- to four-fold or less are more typical.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To overcome the difficulties in exfoliating organoclays in hydrophobic polymers like the polyolefins, researchers have used functionalized polymers, like maleated polyethylene and polypropylene, as dispersants. While polar functional groups can interact with the organoclay surface and compatibalizing agents can promote exfoliation, this approach to nanocomposite formation has provided only modest improvements in the mechanical properties of polyolefins. Moreover, there have not been any published results that show increased barrier toward oxygen or water vapor in polyolefins or waxes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need for a rational approach to the design of new organoclay chemistries that provide both melt- and solid-state miscibility and enable the preparation of nanocomposites demonstrating significant improvements in the control of polymer nucleation, crystal growth, and physical properties such as increased mechanical and barrier performance.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This invention provides a method to prepare clay/polymer nanocomposites with improved control over the dispersion of the organoclay yielding increased barrier properties. Specifically, the method comprises combining an organophilic clay and a polymer to form a nanocomposite, wherein the organophilic clay and the polymer each have a peak recrystallization temperature, and wherein the organophilic clay peak recrystallization temperature sufficiently matches the polymer peak recrystallization temperature such that the nanocomposite formed has less permeability to a gas than the polymer. Such nanocomposites exhibit 2, 5, 10, or even 100 fold or greater reductions in permeability to gasses, e.g., oxygen, carbon dioxide or both, compared to the polymer. Where the peak recrystallization temperatures of the organophilic clay and the polymer are not sufficiently matched, the mixture will show little or no improved barrier properties, and may exhibit partial or substantial phase-separation. Thus, some methods of preparing a nanocomposite include determining whether the peak recrystallization temperature of an organophilic clay sufficiently matches the peak recrystallization temperature of a polymer to form a nanocomposite phase having less permeability to a gas than the polymer, and combining the matched organophilic clay and the polymer to form the nanocomposite having less permeability to a gas than the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Similarly, the invention provides a method for preparing a nanocomposite comprising combining an amorphous organophilic clay and an amorphous polymer to form a nanocomposite, wherein the clay and the polymer each have a glass transition temperature, and wherein the clay glass transition temperature sufficiently matches the polymer glass transition temperature such that the nanocomposite formed has less permeability to a gas than the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Invention methods for the preparation of nanocomposites further include the preparation of the organophilic clay by treating a clay with at least one surfactant to yield an organophilic clay having a peak recrystallization temperature higher than the polymer peak recrystallization temperature. Such an organophilic clay may function as a nucleating agent during formation of the nanocomposite. In addition, by use of such an organoclay the growth of polymer spherulites is lessened, reduced in size or prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The nanocomposites formed by the present method include organophilic clays that are partially or completely exfoliated. Such organophilic clays may be prepared by surface treatment of a clay with a surfactant, such as a quaternary amine, and are compatible with hydrophobic materials such as polyolefins and waxes. Additionally, the surface of the clay is modified to produce an isotropic surface coating so that the polymer will wet and bond to the organoclay. This is achievable by using surfactants with sufficiently long alkyl chains so that they can become a part of the polymer crystal phase. Alternatively, if the polymer is amorphous, such as an elastomer, the surfactant used to produce the organoclay will require alkyl chains that also remain amorphous throughout the temperature range of intended use. Typically, the organoclays are surface treated with a high-molecular-weight quaternary amine together with high-molecular-weight hydrotrope and/or an edge modifying surfactant to render the clay surface organophilic. Suitable clays include phyllosilicates that are able to undergo ion exchange, such as smectites or mica. Natural or synthetic clays may be used in the present invention. Talcs may also be used in the invention but will normally require treatment with an appropriate edge-modifying surfactant. In some embodiments, the methods of the present invention employs a surface-treated clay such as one including a nonionic polymeric hydrotrope adsorbed onto a basal surface thereof, and/or an edge modifying surfactant adsorbed onto an edge thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various processes may be used to prepare the organoclays. By way of non-limiting example, a smectite clay may be dispersed in water with the use of a pressure vessel to enable heating above the boiling point of the water. The clay slurry is heated to a temperature sufficient to melt the quaternary amine and allow ion exchange with the basal surface of the clay. The product of the reaction being an organoclay that exhibits melt/freeze transitions that match those of the polymer sufficiently so that the clay is able to remain dispersed in both the liquid and solid states. The solids concentration of the slurry may range from less than 1 weight percent to approximately 60 to 70 weight percent. At high solids concentration, sufficient mixing can be accomplished by use of a helical paddle mixer or alternatively, the mixing can be done using a twin-screw or single-screw extruder with a pressurized feeder to eliminate boiling of the water and thereby maintain the clay slurry at the desired water to solids ratio.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention provides organoclay/polymer nanocomposites having improved barrier properties and methods for making the same. More specifically, the invention permits the preparation of organoclay/polymer nanocomposites with improved barrier properties, that are explained by simple tortuosity effects, which result from the formation of a nanocomposite phase. The nanocomposite phase may be demonstrated by the presence of a new set of thermal transitions that are intermediate between the individual thermal transitions of the organoclay and the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention provides for the preparation of polyolefin nanocomposites wherein the organophilic clay is homogeneously dispersed throughout the polymer matrix. Such nanocomposites exhibit superior dispersion stability such that the organoclay is dispersed in the polymer melt and is capable of maintaining the homogenous dispersion as the polymer cools to a semi-crystalline solid. Inventive methods also provide for organoclays that act as nucleating agents by virtue of their high specific surface areas and appropriately designed peak recrystallization temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, to prepare clay/polymer nanocomposites according to the present invention, the peak recrystallization temperature of the organophilic clay must be sufficiently matched with the polymer peak recrystallization temperature to promote the formation of the nanocomposite phase. The peak melt temperature is that temperature in which the heat absorption by the crystal phase is a maximum rate. The existence of the nanocomposite phase can readily be determined by those of skill in the art using, e.g., DSC showing the absence of the organoclay freeze transition and the appearance of new thermal transitions. The phrase &#x201c;sufficiently matched&#x201d; does not require that the peak recrystallization temperatures be identical. Indeed, a wide range of peak recrystallization temperatures is possible. In some embodiments, the organoclay peak recrystallization temperature is within &#xb1;100% of the polymer peak recrystallization temperature, and can be within &#xb1;50%. In other embodiments the organoclay peak recrystallization temperature is within &#xb1;25% of the polymer peak recrystallization temperature, and in still others it is within &#xb1;10%. Typically, the barrier properties of a nanocomposite will improve the more closely matched are the peak recrystallization temperatures of the organoclay and polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Other additives such as antioxidants, anticorrosion agents, reactive scavengers, such as colloidal metal oxides for improved acid barrier capabilities, oxygen scavengers for improved oxygen barrier capabilities, UV stabilizers, and colorants such as dyes and pigments may be incorporated into the compositions by admixing with the nanocomposite or by incorporating the additives directly onto the organoclay surface. For example, organoclays may be combined with water-soluble dyes and then dispersed in waxes or polyolefins. In this unique application, the organoclays aid the dispersion of the dyes. Water-soluble dyes which would not be expected to be dispersible in polyolefins may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention also encompasses embodiments wherein the organoclay has been modified on its basal surfaces with nonionic polymeric hydrotropes and on its edges with anionic surfactants that include organophosphorous and organosulfur compounds. The process used to produce hydrotrope-modified organoclays is described in detail in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/078,992, filed on Feb. 20, 2002, and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/100,381, filed on Mar. 18, 2002. Both applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Briefly, adsorption of a polymeric hydrotrope on the basal surface of an edge modified clay is achieved by dispersing and/or dissolving a polymeric hydrotrope in the clay dispersion and allowing the hydrotrope to adsorb onto the surface of the dispersed, edge modified clay. The edge modification of the dispersed clay is carried out using an appropriate organic surfactant modifier.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Suitable organic surfactant edge modifiers for use in the present invention include organophosphorous and organosulfur compounds, particularly the following:</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments where the surface treated clay has been modified on both basal surfaces and edges, the melt comprises about 1 to about 99 weight percent of the nanocomposite. In other embodiments, the surface treated clay comprises about 1 to about 15 weight percent and typically about 3 to about 10 weight percent of the nanocomposite.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In embodiments wherein the phyllosilicates are subject to cation exchange, the phyllosilicates are exposed to enough cationic surfactant to approximately satisfy the cationic exchange capacity of the phyllosilicates. For dispersions in aliphatic solvents, waxes, and polyolefins, the amount of cation in the dispersion should be enough to satisfy from about 50 to about 100 percent of the cation exchange capacity of the phyllosilicates. This includes embodiments where the amount of cation is sufficient to satisfy from about 75 to about 100 percent of the exchange capacity of the phyllosilicate. The use of these amounts has the advantage that it substantially eliminates excess cationic surfactant which is only loosely bound to the phyllosilicate surface and easily separates during processing and composite material formation, degrading the quality of the composite materials. In preparing organoclays for polyolefin nanocomposites, the cation exchange will be carried out at temperatures at least equal to or above the melting point of the surfactant. For surfactants that melt at temperatures above 100&#xb0; C. the exchange will be carried out in a reactive extruder that is pressurized to prevent the evaporative loss of water from the clay slurry.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Suitable clays for use in the invention include phyllosilicate clays, such as mica and smectite clays. Exemplary smectite clays include montmorillonite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, beidellite, nontronite and synthetic smectites such as Laponite&#xae;. As will be well understood by one skilled in the art, the clays discussed herein inherently have basal surfaces and are arranged in layers of particles which are stacked on top of one another. The stacking of the clay platelets provides interlayers, or galleries, between the clay layers. These galleries are normally occupied by cations, typically comprising sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium ions and combinations thereof, that balance the charge deficiency generated by the isomorphous substitution within the clay layers. Typically, water is also present in the galleries and tends to associate with the cations. The distance between the basal surfaces of adjacent clay layers is referred to as the basal spacing.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A wide variety of polymers, including waxes, are suitable for use in nanocomposites produced by inventive methods. Polymers suitable for use include but are not limited to polyethylene (e.g., LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE), poly-&#x3b1;-olefins and poly-&#x3b1;-olefins copolymers with polyethylene, polyesters, polystyrene, poly(methylmethacrylate), poly(methacrylate), poly(ethyl methacrylate), poly(propyl methacrylate), polyisobutylene, poly(stylene-butadiene-styrene), polyurethanes, silicones, polycarbonate, polychloroprene, polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate, atactic polypropylene, syndotactic polypropylene, poly-1-butene, polyisoprene, polybutadiene, polyethylene-co-vinyl alcohol, and polyvinylacetate.</p>

Examples of synthetic waxes include, but are not limited to, Fisher-Tropsch waxes, polyethylene, polypropylene, polymethylene, chemically modified waxes, polymerized alpha-olefins, and mixtures thereof. Chemically modified waxes are well known to those of skill in the art and include hydrocarbon waxes such as microcrystalline and polyethylene waxes that have been oxidized, e.g., by air oxidation or reaction with a polycarboxylic acid, and optionally saponified, esterified or similarly modified. Specific examples of suitable semicrystalline waxes include, but are not limited to polyethylene-block-polyethylene glycol.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">To obtain useful nanocomposite properties in clay/polymer mixtures, the organoclay must be compatible with the polymer. Compatibility between polymer/polymer and polymer/wax blends is known from prior art to be a function of the freezing points of the two components. If one component freezes at a significantly higher temperature than the other, the result upon cooling is a phase separated mixture that does not improve the properties of either component. For example, a paraffin wax that freezes at about 45&#xb0; C. is not compatible with either low density polyethylene which freezes at about 87&#xb0; C. or with high density polyethylene which freezes above 100&#xb0; C. The effect of the organoclay on the peak recrystallization temperatures of the polymer must also be considered in the design of a useful nanocomposite system. Melt and shear histories of polymer systems are also important factors. For example, the peak recrystallization temperature of a polymer can be increased 15&#x2013;20&#xb0; C. if the temperature of the polymer melt is insufficient to ensure complete crystal melting or if the polymer melt contains locally entangled segments originating from the polymer crystallites.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a similar manner, amorphous polymers, such as atactic polypropylene, ethylene propylene random copolymers, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, polyisoprene, polybutadiene, polychloroprene, polyisobutylene, poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene), silicones, polyurthanes, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(methacrylate), poly(ethyl methacrylate), poly(propyl methacrylate), poly(butyl methacrylate), atactic polystyrene, would not be compatible with organoclays that possess a surface crystallization temperature. Organoclay compatibility with amorphous polymers would require sufficiently matching the T<sub>g </sub>(glass transition temperature) of the surfactant coating with that of the polymer if the nanocomposite is to be used at temperatures below the T<sub>g </sub>of the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the present methods further include combining a mixture of polar and nonpolar activators with the organophilic clay to disperse the clay in the polymer. Suitable polar activators include alcohols and ketones such as methanol, ethanol, acetone and the like, well known to those of skill in the art. Nonpolar activators that may be used include nonpolar solvents such as styrenes, xylenes or toluenes as well as polymers such as polybutenes, oligomers of polystyrenes, poly alpha olefins, polybutene block copolymers, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates or waxes. For example an organophilic clay that has been surface treated with a quaternary ammonium salt such as CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) is normally not dispersible in nonpolar polymers. However, a combination of a non-polar activator such as a polybutene (e.g., polybutene-block-polystyrene) and a polar activator will allow such an organophilic clay to be dispersed in a nonpolar polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The nanocomposites prepared according to the present invention display unexpectedly high gas barrier capabilities in comparison to previous clay/wax and clay/polymer nanocomposites. The nanocomposites disclosed herein can routinely reduce the oxygen permeability of wax coatings by a factor of ten to one hundred or more. The nanocomposites may also provide barriers to nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, or water vapor. At sufficient clay concentrations, the permeability may be reduced by one thousand to ten thousand or more. Combinations of wax nanocomposites with polyolefins can in turn result in significant reductions in gas permeability relative to the pure polymer. Reductions in gas permeability (e.g. oxygen, carbon dioxide, or both) of two fold or even ten to one-hundred fold or more relative to the pure polymer can be achieved with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">While not wishing to be bound by theory and without limiting the scope of the invention, it is believed that invention methods improve the barrier properties of clay/polymer nanocomposites by taking into account the effect of the semi-crystalline structure of polymers on nanocomposite morphology and performance. The polyolefins, consist of a mixture of crystalline and amorphous phases at temperatures above the T<sub>g </sub>and below T<sub>m </sub>(melting transition temperature) The hydrocarbon chains fold in on themselves to form crystallites which in turn stack upon themselves to form spherulites. The crystallites are generally on the order of 10&#x2013;20 nm, while the spherulites can be as large as 50&#x2013;100 microns or larger as in the case of waxes. The crystallites are held together by amorphous polymer segments which contribute to the strength of the material. If the hydrocarbon chain length is shortened sufficiently, as in the case of the waxes, the chains become less and less able to bridge the gap between the crystallites, and the material becomes brittle. Gas diffusion can take place at the interfaces between the crystallites and at the surfaces of the spherulites. Thus, a tortuous diffusion path is an inherent component of all semi-crystalline polymer systems.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Despite the chemical similarity between paraffin wax and low-density polyethylene (LDPE), they are not compatible because of the large difference in their freezing points&#x2014;that is, their mixtures phase-separate upon cooling from the melt. By extension, organoclay that is prepared with paraffin-like surfactants is unlikely to be compatible with either LDPE or the other polyolefins. During cooling of the polymer, if the interaction energy between the organoclay surface and the polymer chains is insufficient to disrupt the normal crystallization process, the organoclay will be pushed aside by the growing polymer crystallites, along with any other impurities that happen to be present in the polymer melt. In fact, there is no prior art showing an increase in barrier properties for any olefin-based nanocomposites, including waxes. In these systems, the addition of organoclays, according to prior art, actually results in a decrease of barrier properties. The lack of significant commercial nanocomposite barrier materials, despite years of research since the first publications in the field (see, e.g., Okada, F., et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,739,007 (1988)) illustrates just how difficult these problems are to solve.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, it is not enough that the melted polymer wet the surface of the organoclay; the cohesion energy of the organoclay coating must be close to that of the wax or polyolefin crystal phase. In other words, the freezing points of the surfactant chains on the clay surface and the polyolefin must be close enough to enable the exfoliated organoclay to enter solid solution as the nanocomposite phase freezes. It is reasonable to expect that this requirement will be true of all semi-crystalline materials, such as nylons, polyesters, and polyolefins. Because of supercooling effects, peak recrystallization temperatures will be lower than the melting temperatures. In addition, the presence of the organoclay may affect the peak recrystallization temperature, especially if the organoclay is capable of acting as a nucleating agent. Therefore, the peak recrystallization temperature is expected to be a better predictor of solid-state miscibility than is the melting point.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">This example illustrates the superior barrier performance that can be achieved when the melt/freeze transitions of the organoclay and a paraffin wax are sufficiently matched to generate a new nanocomposite phase. An organophilic clay was prepared from a commercially available, water-washed montmorillonite (Cloisite Na&#xae; which is a product of Southern Clay Products). The clay was dispersed in 40&#xb0; C. tap water at a solids concentration of 2.5 weight percent by high-shear mixing for 40 minutes. The edge of the clay was modified by addition of an aqueous solution of the ammonium salt of 1-hydroxydodecane-1,1-diphosphonic acid. The amount of ammonium alkyldiphosphonate added was 3 weight percent relative to the weight of the dry clay. Following equilibration for 30 minutes, the temperature of the slurry was increased to 70&#xb0; C. and an amount of dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium chloride (Arquad 2HT-75, a quaternary amine salt commercially available from Akzo Nobel) equivalent to 110 milliequivalents per 100 g clay was added over a period of one hour. Combined with the quaternary amine was an amount of poly(propylene glycol) equivalent to 4 weight percent relative to the dry weight of the clay. The molecular weight of the poly(propylene glycol) was 1000. Also combined with the quaternary amine solution was an antioxidant, Irganox&#xae; B225 (a product of Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp.) at a concentration of 1000 ppm relative to the weight of the organoclay. Mixing of the clay suspension was continued for one hour after all of the quaternary amine salt was added. The suspension was vacuum filtered, redispersed in deionized water at 60&#xb0; C. and refiltered. The organoclay was dried under vacuum at 70&#xb0; C. to produce a fine powder with less than 1 weight percent moisture. The basal spacing of the organoclay product, as measured by x-ray diffraction, was approximately 36.5 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Wax nanocomposites with organoclay concentrations of 5, 10, and 15 weight percent were prepared by mixing the organoclay powder into the melted wax with stirring at approximately 80&#xb0; C. The paraffin used to prepare the samples was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. The wax nanocomposites were applied to a silicone release paper using a smooth coating rod from R. D. Specialties, Inc.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The oxygen transmission rate was measured on films with thickness of approximately 2 mils. The measured film thickness was used to calculate oxygen permeability from the measured oxygen transmission rate. The results for three different organoclay loadings are shown in Table 1 along with the reference value for zero clay addition. (A control experiment in which 5 weight percent Cloisite 15A was dispersed in the wax showed no reduction in oxygen permeability.) There is a dramatic decrease in oxygen permeability with increasing organoclay concentration until 15 weight percent organoclay loading. Microscopic examination of the film with 15 weight percent organoclay revealed extensive cracking that looked identical to that in the reference film with no added organoclay. With only 5 weight percent organoclay the oxygen permeability dropped by approximately 62 fold, while with 10 weight percent organoclay addition, the oxygen permeability dropped by 330 fold. This performance is well beyond what has been found in nylon nanocomposites where reduction in oxygen permeability of 2&#x2013;5 fold is found for 2&#x2013;5 weight percent organoclay loading. See, e.g., A. Usuki, N. Hasegawa, H. Kadoura, and T. Okamoto, Nano Lett, 1, No. 5, 271 (2001). No reduction in oxygen permeability has been reported for wax nanocomposites.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The levels of reduction in gas permeability found in nylon nanocomposites are consistent with tortuosity mechanism in which the permeability is proportional to clay loading (i.e., Nielsen model). If the gas permeability is limited by diffusion through narrow gaps between the oriented clay platelets, the relative permeability is a function of the aspect ration (&#x3b1;) and the clay loading (&#x3c6; as shown in equation (1):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i><sub>o</sub><i>/P</i><sub>c</sub>=1+&#xbd;&#x3b1;&#xb7;&#x3c6;&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where P<sub>o </sub>and P<sub>c </sub>are the permeability of the pure polymer and the nanocomposite, respectively. In this case the relative permeability is proportional to the clay loading. If the premeability is limited by gas diffusion around impermeable clay platelets, the relative permeability becomes proportional to the square of the clay loading:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i><sub>o</sub><i>/P</i><sub>c</sub>=1+&#x3b1;<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;&#x3c6;<sup>2</sup>/(1&#x2212;&#x3c6;)&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">If we attempt to fit the data of Table 1 with the Nielsen equation (Eq. 1) in which the gas premeability is a function of both the volume fraction of the mineral filler and the aspect ratio of the filler platelets, we can calculate an effective aspect ratio for the organoclay platelets in our wax nanocomposites at 5 and 10 weight percent organoclay. The calculated aspect ratios turn out to be approximately 3,000 and 9,500 for 5 weight percent and 10 weight percent clay loading, respectively. These values are well beyond the typical aspect ratios for montmorillonite which are reported to be between 100&#x2013;500. If, on the other hand, we use Eq 2 to back calculate an effective aspect ratio, we obtain values of 250 and 240 at 5 and 10 weight percent loading, respectively. These values are well within the physically acceptable range of aspect ratios for montmorillonite in nanocomposite systems. Clearly, the mechanism by which the oxygen permeability in the wax nanocomposites is reduced is by a tortuous path in which the permeability is limited by diffusion around the clay platelets as described in Eq 2.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this example, the melt/freeze transitions of the organoclay and the wax are close enough to produce a nanocomposite phase in which the organoclay remains in solid solution after the freezing of the wax takes place. The DSC data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> show the peak of the melt and freeze transitions of the pure organoclay which occur at 39.6&#xb0; C. and 34.4&#xb0; C., respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the DSC cooling curves for the paraffin wax and the nanocomposite containing 10 weight percent organoclay are shown. The peak freeze transitions for the paraffin wax occur at 45.7&#xb0; C. and 28.4&#xb0; C. with &#x394;H values of &#x2212;136.8 J/g and &#x2212;26.6 J/g, respectively. The presence of two freeze temperatures indicates that the paraffin wax consists of a bimodal distribution of molecular weights. The cooling curve for the nanocomposite is almost identical to the pure paraffin wax, but differs in a significant way when the total thermal transition energy is considered. The freeze transition of the organoclay at 35&#xb0; C. is no longer present in the nanocomposite because of the formation of a new nanocomposite phase. The peak freeze transitions of the nanocomposite occur at 45.2 and 28.1&#xb0; C. with &#x394;H values of &#x2212;127.0 J/g and &#x2212;27.5 J/g, respectively. From a measurement of normalized peak areas (i.e., normalized for sample weight), the total heat of crystallization for the pure paraffin is &#x2212;0.99 J while for the nanocomposite the value is &#x2212;1.66 J. These data show that the degree of crystallization in the nanocomposite is higher than the paraffin reference. Thus, it may be concluded that the organoclay acts as a nucleating agent.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this example, the effect of using a paraffinic wax with increased melt/freeze temperature on nanocomposite performance is illustrated. The organoclay of Example 1 was dispersed in Paraflint H-I (a product of Moore &#x26; Munger). This is a high melting wax that is miscible with low density polyethylene (LDPE) at low wax/polymer ratios. The melt and freeze transitions of the wax are almost identical with that of LDPE. The nanocomposite was prepared with 10 weight percent organoclay loading and the oxygen permeability of the pure wax and the nanocomposite were measured. The permeability of the reference wax was 3404&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;17 </sup>mol O<sub>2</sub>/m&#xb7;s&#xb7;Pa, while that of the nanocomposite was 2393&#xd7;10&#x2013;17 mol O<sub>2</sub>/m&#xb7;s&#xb7;Pa. In this case the oxygen permeability was reduced only 30 percent relative to the pure wax. This is in contrast to the paraffin wax nanocomposite of Example 1 which demonstrated a 98.4 percent reduction in oxygen permeability at 10 weight percent organoclay loading. This example illustrates the point that as the freeze transitions of the organoclay and the wax are further separated from one another, the ability to form an effective nanocomposite phase is diminished.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While maintaining the organoclay in an exfoliated state is important to nanocomposite performance, it may not be the only determining factor affecting barrier performance. Without wishing to be limited to any specific theory, it is believed that the inability of an isotropic polymer phase to wet and bond with an anisotropic organoclay surface is also a contributing factor responsible for the poor barrier performance observed in polyolefin systems, and in polymer systems in general. In other words, while it may be relatively easy for a paraffin molecule to suffer the loss in entropy necessary to adopt a favorable orientation to interact with the organoclay surface, it is unlikely that the significantly greater loss in entropy accompanying the uncoiling of a high-molecular-weight polymer could be compensated sufficiently by changes in enthalpy. This hypothesis is supported by the data in Table 2, which show the effects of freezing points and molecular weight on oxygen barrier. As the olefin chain length is increase from paraffin to LDPE, we see a steady decline in the influence of the organoclay on oxygen transmission rate. This can be partially explained by the fact that an increase in chain length is accompanied by an increase in peak recrystallization temperature, which would lead to phase separation of the clay during cooling of the melt. However, while the peak recrystallization temperatures of Paraflint H-1 and LDPE are virtually identical, the wax nanocomposite still exhibits some improvement in barrier properties while the LDPE system shows no change in oxygen permeability.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 4</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">To overcome the difficulties in exfoliating organoclays in hydrophobic polymers like the polyolefins, researchers have used functionalized polymers, like maleated polyethylene and polypropylene, as dispersants. While polar functional groups can interact with the organoclay surface and compatibilizing agents can promote exfolation, the presence of organoclay thermal transitions would still be present and, if not matched to the polymer, would create a highly permeable interphase surrounding the organoclay. While this approach to nanocomposite formation has been shown to provide modest improvements in the mechanical properties of polyolefins, there is no prior art that shows increased barrier toward oxygen or water vapor in polyolefins or waxes.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In Example 1, the poly(propylene glycol) was used to introduce disorder within the quaternary amine monolayer. In this example a cosurfactant is used to increase the interaction between the organoclay surface and LDPE by increasing the effective freeze temperature of the organoclay surface and to introduce a degree of isotropy to the organoclay surface. An organoclay was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except without the addition of poly(propylene glycol). Furthermore, the quaternary amine loading was reduced to 90 meq per 100 g of clay to accommodate the adsorption of the cosurfactant. The organoclay filter cake was mixed with polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (Aldrich Chemical Co.) at a weight ratio of 70 percent organoclay to 30 percent cosurfactant, on a dry basis. The cosurfactant, which has an HLB value of 4, a 50-carbon alkyl chain, and a melting and freezing point that closely matches that of LDPE is miscible with LDPE at low loading levels.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The DSC data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are the cooling curves for the polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) and the clay nanocomposite containing 70 weight percent organoclay. The presence of the organoclay reduced the peak freeze temperature of the block copolymer from 92.6&#xb0; C. to 84&#xb0; C., indicating the presence of a nanocomposite phase having thermal transitions that are intermediate to those of the individual components. However, the thermal transitions present in the pure organoclay of Example 1 were still detectable in the nanocomposite. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the melt transitions of the quaternary amine and the cosurfactant are detectible at 42.1&#xb0; and 97.1&#xb0; C., respectively. The broad melt/freeze transitions of the cosurfactant are also noteworthy and problematic. The broad thermal transitions mean that at least a portion of the organoclay surface will be in the melt state while the polymer is recrystallizing. This raises the possibility of forming interfacial defects between the organoclay and the polymer as the system cools to room temperature. The ideal surfactant for preparing an organoclay would display narrow melt/freeze transitions at temperatures near or slightly above the thermal transitions of the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The x-ray diffraction pattern of the nanocomposite showed a broad reflection from the basal surface without any discrete basal spacing (D. J. Chaiko in <i>Affordable Materials Technology&#x2014;Platform to Global Value and Performance</i>, B. M. Pasmussen, L. A. Pilato, and H. S. Kliker, EDS., SAMPE: Covinal, Calif., 2002, 1064). The organoclay concentrate was diluted with LDPE to a final organoclay concentration of about 8 weight percent by compounding in a Brabender mixer for 30 min. at 130&#xb0; C. at a temperature of 170&#xb0; C. The nanocomposite was compression molded to produce transparent films of 125 microns thick. The oxygen permeability of the nanocomposite was measured and found to be 14 times lower than the LDPE reference. This represents an approximate 93 percent reduction in oxygen transmission relative to the pure LDPE film.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">While the performance of the nanocomposite is very good, the relative reduction in oxygen permeability is less than what was observed in the paraffin system of Example 1. This is believed to be due to the fact that the melt/freeze transitions of the organoclay surface were still detectable (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Increasing the peak recrystallization temperature of the organoclay by use of a higher freezing quaternary amine would be expected to improve the barrier properties even further.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">This example highlights the fact that while coupling agents or compatibilizing agents (e.g., maleated polyolefins) may help disperse the organoclay and aid in the formation of nanoscale dispersions, the fact remains that the phase transitions of the quaternary amine are likely to still be present, and can be expected to lead to grain boundary defects that would provide an unimpeded path for gas transport, thereby limiting the barrier performance of the nanocomposite.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">This example illustrates the compatibility between an organoclay and an amorphous polymer. In this case the crystal phase transitions of the surfactant monolayer at the clay surface are inhibited, rendering the clay surface miscible with the polymer. An organophilic clay was prepared from a commercially available, water-washed montmorillonite (Cloisite Na&#xae; which is a product of Southern Clay Products). The clay was dispersed in 40&#xb0; C. tap water at a solids concentration of 2.5 weight percent by high-shear mixing for 40 minutes. The edge of the clay was modified by addition of an aqueous solution of the ammonium salt of 1-hydroxydodecane-1,1-diphosphonic acid. The amount of ammonium alkyldiphosphonate added was 3 weight percent relative to the weight of the dry clay. Following equilibration for 30 minutes, the temperature of the slurry was increased to 70&#xb0; C. and an amount of dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium chloride (Arquad 2HT-75, a quaternary amine salt commercially available from Akzo Nobel) equivalent to 110 milliequivalents per 100 g clay was added over a period of one hour. Combined with the quaternary amine was an amount of poly(propylene glycol) equivalent to 4 weight percent relative to the dry weight of the clay. The molecular weight of the poly(propylene glycol) was 1000. Also combined with the quaternary amine solution was an antioxidant, Irganox&#xae; B225 (a product of Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp.) at a concentration of 1000 ppm relative to the weight of the organoclay. Mixing of the clay suspension was continued for one hour after all of the quaternary amine salt was added. The suspension was vacuum filtered, redispersed in deionized water at 60&#xb0; C. and refiltered. The organoclay filter cake was mixed with ethanol at a concentration of 30 wt % relative to the weight of the organoclay (dry basis) and polybutenes (a mixture of isomers containing &#x3e;90% isobutylene, Average M<sub>n </sub>750) at a concentration of 50 wt % relative to the weight of the organoclay (dry basis). The material was mixed at 90&#xb0; C. to disperse the organoclay in the polybutenes. The water associated with the organoclay filter cake was flushed from the clay surface as a liquid water phase that was decanted. The last traces of water and alcohol were removed with continued stirring at 90&#xb0; C. The product was a transparent green nanocomposite. Oxygen and carbon dioxide transmission were measured by preparing a laminate film wherein the nanocomposite was layered between two sheets of polystyrene. The gas transmission was measured at 30&#xb0; C. The gas transmission of the polystyrene film was measured independently and used to calculate the effective permeability of the nanocomposite layer using the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>1/<i>P</i><sub>t</sub>=&#x3b8;<sub>1</sub><i>/P</i><sub>1</sub>+&#x3b8;<sub>2</sub><i>/P</i><sub>2</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Where P<sub>t </sub>is the permeability of the laminate, P<sub>1 </sub>and P<sub>2 </sub>are the permeability of the polystyrene and nanocomposite films, respectively; &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3b8;<sub>2 </sub>are the fractional thickness of the respective films. The gas transmission results are given in Table 3. In this example the organoclay is able to improve the gas barrier properties of the amorphous polymer film even though the organoclay by itself shows a melt/freeze transition which would be expected to render the organoclay incompatible. However, DSC measurements show that in this example, the polymer interacts with the organoclay in such a way as to inhibit the normal melt/freeze transitions of the organoclay surface. The DSC data are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and indicate the presence of both crystal and amorphous phases within the surfactant monolayer.</p>

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 6</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this example an organoclay concentrate is prepared that is compatible with the amorphous phase of a polyolefin. The organoclay filter cake of Example 5 was combined with ethanol at a concentration of 30 wt % relative to the weight of the dry organoclay, polybutenes (M<sub>n </sub>of 750) at a concentration of 15 wt % relative to the weight of the dry organoclay. As in Example 5, the water was flushed from the filter cake as a liquid stream and decanted. The concentrate was then mixed at 90&#xb0; C. with poly(ethylene-co-1-butene) having a melting point of 60&#xb0; C. at a concentration of 30 wt % relative to the weight of the dry organoclay. The remainder of the water and alcohol were removed with continued stirring at 90&#xb0; C. The product was a clear, green concentrate that can be diluted with polyethylene to produce a final nanocomposite. Diluting 10:1 produced a clear transparent nanocomposite with no trace of undispersed clay. In this example, the low molecular weight alcohol combined with the amorphous polybutenes act in conjunction as polar and nonpolar activators, enabling the dispersion of the organoclay in the high molecular weight poly(ethylene-co-1-butene). The poly(ethylene-co-1-butene), in turn acts as a compatibilizer rendering the organoclay miscible with the amorphous polyethylene phase.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 7</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The use of polar activators to aid the dispersion of organoclays into various organic systems has been discussed in the scientific and patent literature. The most effective activators have been found to be low-molecular-weight alcohols and ketones (e.g., methanol, ethanol, acetone). However, there is no discussion in either the scientific or patent literature about the use of combinations comprised of polar and nonpolar activators. This example offers an additional illustration of the use of combined polar/nonpolar activator systems to effect the dispersion of an organoclay into a high-molecular-weight polymer. The organoclay filter cake of Example 5 was combined with ethanol and polybutenes (M<sub>n </sub>750) to produce an activated organoclay. The mixture was combined with polybutadiene and heated to remove last traces of water and ethanol. The product was a crystal clear yellow nanocomposite. Polar and nonpolar activators are used to enable dispersion of an organoclay in an amorphous polymer. It was also observed that clear transparent nanocomposites could be produced by dispersing the activated organoclay of this example into polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(ethylene-co-octene) (Engage&#xae; 8402, a product of DuPont), atactic polypropylene, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, and monomers such as ethyl hexyl diacrylate.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 8</heading>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">This example further illustrates the use of combined polar/nonpolar activators to aid the dispersion of high melting organoclays into amorphous polymers. An organophilic clay was prepared from a commercially available, water-washed montmorillonite (Cloisite Na&#xae; which is a product of Southern Clay Products). The clay was dispersed in 40&#xb0; C. tap water at a solids concentration of 2.5 weight percent by high-shear mixing for 40 minutes. The temperature of the slurry was increased to 70&#xb0; C. and an amount of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) equivalent to 90 milliequivalents per 100 g clay was added over a period of one hour. Combined with the quaternary amine was an amount of poly(ethylene glycol) equivalent to 4 weight percent relative to the dry weight of the clay. The molecular weight of the poly(ethylene glycol) was 1500. The organoclay was dried and crusher to produce a fine powder. The dispersion of the organoclay into polybutenes (Mn 750) was aided by the addition of both ethanol and toluene (50:50) to a concentration of about 30 wt % relative to the weight of the organoclay. The use of combined polar/nonpolar activators enabled the organoclay to disperse in the polybutenes. Continued mixing at approximately 130&#xb0; C. resulted in the evaporation of the ethanol and toluene leading to a highly viscous, transparent nanocomposite. In this example the crystalline surfactant coating of the activated organoclay was rendered amorphous by combination with an amorphous polymer.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 9</heading>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this example a high melting organoclay is dispersed into a semicrystalline polymer with the aid of combined polar/nonpolar activators. The CTAB organoclay of Example 8 was activated by combining with 30 wt % ethanol relative to the weight of the dry organoclay and dispersed in xylene. The weight ratio of organoclay to xylene was 0.04. The combination of ethanol and xylene led to a transparent organoclay dispersion. A polypropylene oligomer, created by vis-breaking polypropylene with Trigonox&#xae; 101 (a product of Akzo Nobel) was added to the organoclay slurry and heated to 110&#xb0; C. to produce a clear organoclay dispersion. The mixture was poured into an open glass dish to allow the xylene and alcohol to evaporate. During evaporation of the solvent the nanocomposite became violet due to small angle scattering of visible light as the polymer crystallized. The final composition of the concentrate was 30 wt % CTAB treated organoclay, 70 wt % vis-broken polypropylene. The concentrate was further diluted by combining one g of the concentrate with 30 g of polypropylene by mixing for 5 min at approximately 180&#xb0; C. in a Brabender mixer at 50 rpm. Compression molded films of the nanocomposite were crystal clear with a noticeably higher bending modulus.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 10</heading>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Comparative Example</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the previous examples, the quaternary amine used to prepare the organoclay exhibited a melting point below 40&#xb0; C. In the present comparative example, an organoclay is prepared using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, which has a decomposition temperature in excess of 230&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The organoclay was prepared by dispersing Cloisite Na&#xae; in deionized water at 40&#xb0; C. The clay was dispersed with high shear mixing at a solids concentration of 2 weight percent. The edge of the clay was treated with the ammonium salt of 1-hydroxydodecane-1,1-diphosphonic acid. The amount of ammonium alkyldiphosphonate added was 0.5 weight percent relative to the weight of the dry clay. Following equilibration for 30 minutes, the temperature of the slurry was raised to 70&#xb0; C. and an amount of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (Aldrich) was added equivalent to 100 meq per 100 g clay over a period of one half hour. Combined with the quaternary amine was an amount of poly(ethylene glycol) equivalent to 4 weight percent relative to the weight of the dry clay. The molecular weight of the poly(ethylene glycol) was 1500. Mixing of the clay suspension was continued for one hour after all of the quaternary amine salt was added. The suspension was filtered, redispersed in deionized water at 70&#xb0; C. and refiltered. The organoclay was dried crushed and examined by DSC. The organoclay did not show a melt transition. Furthermore, the organoclay failed to disperse in LDPE by melt compounding. This example illustrates the importance of preparing organoclays with surfactants that exhibit melt/freeze transitions near those of the polymer if dispersion and exfoliation are to be achieved.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electromagnetic actuator having: a fixed core supported by a bottom wall of a housing made of magnetic material; a movable core arranged opposite to the fixed core via an air gap to drive a movable member; and coil assembly comprising a bobbin supported by the housing to surround the fixed and movable cores, and a coil wound around the bobbin.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such an electromagnetic actuator is already known as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-1765.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the electromagnetic actuator, characteristics of the movable member concerning thrust and displacement are dependent on an initial air gap between attracted surfaces of the fixed and movable cores, but the initial air gap may not be within the tolerance due to accumulated manufacturing errors of each part of the actuator. In the conventional one, for such an occasion, several types of coupling members with different length for coupling the movable member to the movable core have been prepared in advance and the air gap has been adjusted by replacing the coupling member.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, such adjustment means for air gaps requires several types of coupling members, and moreover takes time and efforts in the replacement operation, so that the cost is inevitably increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been achieved in view of the above-described circumstances, and has an object to provide a low-priced electromagnetic actuator capable of freely adjusting an air gap between fixed and movable cores without preparing various types of coupling members.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve the above-described object, according to a first feature of the present invention, there is provided an electromagnetic actuator comprising: a fixed core supported by a bottom wall of a housing made of magnetic material; a movable core arranged opposite to the fixed core via an air gap to drive a movable member; and a coil assembly comprising a bobbin supported by the housing to surround the fixed and movable cores, and a coil wound around the bobbin, wherein the movable member and the movable core are coupled by coupling means for adjusting the air gap between the fixed core and the movable core, and wherein an adjustment operating hole through which the coupling means is adjusted is provided on the fixed core so as to be opened outside the bottom wall of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With the first feature, by operating the coupling means, it is possible to freely adjust an air gap between the fixed core and the movable core, thereby imparting a desired vibration isolation characteristic to an active type vibration isolating support system. Therefore, the air gap is easily adjusted, and moreover there is no need for preparing various types of components having different dimensions in order to adjust the air gap, whereby the cost can be reduced. Moreover, since the coupling means is operated through the adjustment operating hole of the fixed core which is opened outside the housing, it is possible to accurately adjust the air gap without regard to assembly errors in each part after the completion of assembly of the actuator, thereby easily providing a high-quality actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition to the first feature, according to a second feature of the present invention, the fixed core is integrally formed with a positioning shaft in which the adjustment operating hole is opened on an outer end surface and with a flange-shaped first yoke which protrudes from the outer periphery of the fixed core to be arranged opposite to one end surface of the coil assembly; the positioning shaft is fitted and fixed into a positioning hole provided at the bottom wall of the housing; the first yoke is brought into close contact with an inner surface of the bottom wall to surround the movable core; and a second yoke arranged opposite to the other end surface of the coil assembly is continuously provided to the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the second feature, although the fixed core becomes hollow because it has the adjustment operating hole, a positioning shaft integral with the fixed core is fitted and fixed to the positioning hole in the bottom wall of the housing, and the flange-shaped first yoke is brought into close contact with the bottom wall, whereby the fixed core is firmly reinforced to become capable of withstanding an abutting shock which the fixed core receives from the movable core and suffers no position shift. Moreover, the first yoke effectively increases magnetic paths around the coil assembly in cooperation with the housing and the second yoke, thereby increasing the attracting force between the fixed and movable core.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, in addition to the second feature, according to a third feature of the present invention, the bobbin is continuously provided with a coil cover which covers the outer periphery of the coil to seal the coil to the bobbin; the housing is arranged so that its bottom wall faces downward; and between the first yoke and the other end surfaces of the bobbin and the coil cover, there is interposed an elastic plate which water tightly comes into close contact with their opposite surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">With the third feature, by elastically holding the coil assembly on the housing through use of the elastic plate, it is possible to enhance its vibration resistance. Moreover, even when water accumulated in the bottom part of the housing, the coil is waterproofed by the elastic plate, thereby greatly contributing to improvement in durability of the coil.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, in addition to the first feature, according to a fourth feature of the present invention, the fixed core is integrally formed with a flange-shaped first yoke which protrudes from an outer periphery of the fixed core to be arranged opposite to one end surface of the coil assembly and which is supported on the bottom wall of the housing; a second yoke which surrounds the movable core and is arranged opposite to the other end surface of the coil assembly is fixed to the housing; a tube-shaped bearing member which slidably supports the movable core is slidably fitted in the second yoke; and a set spring is provided in a compressed state between the second yoke and an outward flange which is formed at a lower end of the bearing member and which is supported on the first yoke, thereby biasing the outward flange toward the first yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With the fourth feature, a stable operation of the movable core can be secured by the bearing member. Moreover, with very simple structure in which a set spring is provided in a compressed state between the outward flange of the bearing member and the second yoke, the bearing member can be installed at a fixed position, whereby no high precision is needed for the installation and the cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Also, according to a fifth feature of the present invention, there is provided-an electromagnetic actuator comprising: a fixed core supported by a bottom wall of a housing made of magnetic material; a movable core arranged opposite to the fixed core via an air gap to drive the movable member; a coil assembly comprising a bobbin supported by the housing to surround the fixed and movable cores, and a coil wound around the bobbin; and a tube-shaped bearing member disposed inside the coil assembly to slidably support the movable core, wherein a first yoke for holding the coil assembly in corporation with the bottom wall is continuously provided to the housing; wherein the bearing member is slidably fitted in the first yoke; wherein a supporting portion for supporting an outward flange formed at one end of the bearing member is provided on the bottom wall; and wherein a set spring for biasing the outward flange toward the supporting portion is provided in a compressed state between the outward flange and the first yoke.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With the fifth feature, since the set spring of the bearing member is arranged on the outer periphery side of the bearing member, even if abrasion powder is produced between the set spring and a portion against which the set spring abuts under pressure, it is possible to prevent the abrasion powder from entering the bearing member, thereby securing smooth sliding of the movable core. Also, since a repulsion force of the set spring is supported on the first yoke continuing to the housing and is not exerted on the movable core, it is possible to prevent any loss of an effective attracting force between the fixed and movable cores due to the repulsion force of the set spring, thereby improving the output performance of the movable core.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Also, in addition to the fifth feature, according to a sixth feature of the present invention, the fixed core is integrally formed with a positioning shaft fitted and fixed in a positioning hole provided on the bottom wall and with a second yoke which comes into close contact with an inner surface of the bottom wall and opposes to the first yoke with the coil assembly sandwiched therebetween, and the second yoke constitutes the supporting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With the sixth feature, the fixed core is reinforced by fitting and fixing the positioning shaft integral therewith in the positioning hole in the bottom wall of the housing and by bringing the second yoke into close contact with the bottom wall. Therefore, the fixed core is capable of withstanding an abutting shock which the fixed core receives from the movable core, and further the fixed core suffers no position shift. Moreover, the second yoke is capable of effectively increasing magnetic paths around the coil assembly in cooperation with the housing and the first yoke, thereby increasing the attracting force between the fixed and movable cores.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Also, according to a seventh feature of the present invention, there is provided an electromagnetic actuator comprising: a fixed core supported by a bottom wall of a housing made of magnetic material; a movable core arranged opposite to the fixed core via an air gap to drive a movable member; and a coil assembly comprising a bobbin supported by the housing to surround the fixed and movable cores, and a coil wound around the bobbin, wherein a small strut for insert-connecting a proximal end of a coupler terminal is integrally formed on one end surface of the bobbin; wherein an outgoing line of the coil wound around the small strut is connected to the coupler terminal; and wherein on a coil cover molded on an outer periphery of the coil and the bobbin so as to seal the coil to the bobbin, there are integrally formed a coupler for holding the coupler terminal to protrude outward in a radial direction of the coil assembly and a protruded portion for enveloping the small strut to protrude from an end surface of the coil cover.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With the seventh feature, by molding the coil cover on the outer periphery of the coil and the bobbin so as to seal the coil to the bobbin, water resistance of the coil can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Moreover, since the coupler for holding the coupler terminal to protrude outward in the radial direction is integrally formed on the coil cover, both the lead wire to be connected to the coil and a coupler holder for supporting the coupler become unnecessary, so that the number of components and assembling steps are reduced and the cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Also, a small strut for insert-connecting a proximal end portion of a coupler terminal is integrally formed on one end surface of the bobbin; an outgoing line of the coil wound around the small strut is connected to the coupler terminal; and a protruded portion for enveloping the small strut to protrude from an end surface of the coil cover is formed integrally with the coil cover together with the coupler. Therefore, by winding the outgoing line of the coil around the small strut, it is possible to mold the coil cover, the coupler and the protruded portion, while reliably preventing the outgoing line from loosening.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Also, in addition to the seventh feature, according to an eighth feature of the present invention, the coupler is exposed to the outside through an aperture provided from the peripheral wall of the housing to the bottom wall, and the protruded portion is arranged within the aperture so as to be adjacent to the bottom wall.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With the eighth feature, the actuator can be constructed compactly without the need for providing any accommodating space for the protruded portion in the housing, and without overhanging the protruded portion over the outer surface of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The connecting means corresponds to a connecting bolt <b>55</b>, an adjustment nut <b>56</b> and a set spring <b>57</b> in an embodiment of the present invention to be described later. Also, the first yoke and the second yoke correspond to an upper yoke <b>35</b> and a lower yoke <b>36</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The above-mentioned object, other objects, characteristics, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from an explanation of a preferred embodiment, which will be described in detail below by reference to the attached drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Hereinafter, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described by reference to the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">First, a first embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> will be described. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an active type vibration isolating support system M is, in order to elastically support the engine E on the body frame F in an automobile, interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The active type vibration isolating support system M has actually axisymmetric structure with respect to an axis L, and has a plate-shaped installation bracket <b>11</b> to be connected to the engine E; an inner tube <b>12</b> welded to this installation bracket <b>11</b>; an outer tube <b>13</b> which is coaxially arranged around an outer periphery of this inner tube <b>12</b>; and a first elastic body <b>14</b> made of thick rubber or the like to be vulcanized and bonded onto conical surfaces of these inner tube <b>12</b> and outer tube <b>13</b> which oppose to each other. Below this first elastic body <b>14</b>, there are arranged a first orifice formation member <b>15</b>, a second orifice formation member <b>16</b> and a third orifice formation member <b>17</b>, which are arranged vertically and made integral with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first orifice formation member <b>15</b> is shaped like a disk, and has an aperture <b>15</b><i>b </i>at a center thereof. The second orifice formation member <b>16</b> is annular, having a gutter-shaped cross section, the upper surface of which has been opened, and is integrally joined with the first orifice formation member <b>15</b> so that the opened upper surface is closed by the first orifice formation member <b>15</b>. The third orifice formation member <b>17</b> is also annular, having a gutter-shaped cross section, the upper surface of which has been opened, and is integrally joined with the second orifice formation member <b>16</b> so that the opened upper surface is closed by the second orifice formation member <b>16</b>. Outer peripheral portions of the first and second orifice formation members <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> are superimposed on to be made integral with each other, and are fixed to an annular crimping fixed portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>continuously provided below the outer tube <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">On an inner peripheral surface of the third orifice formation member <b>17</b>, an outer peripheral surface of the annular second elastic body <b>18</b> made of rubber or the like is vulcanized and bonded. On the inner peripheral surface of this second elastic body <b>18</b>, there is vulcanized and bonded a first cap member <b>19</b> with the lower surface opened, arranged on the axis L. In this first cap member <b>19</b>, a second cap member <b>23</b> and a movable member <b>20</b> are fixed by press-fitting in order. The second cap member <b>23</b> has its lower end portion protruding toward a lower place of the first cap member <b>19</b>. On the outer peripheral surface of this protruded portion, there is vulcanized and bonded an inner peripheral end portion of a diaphragm <b>22</b> arranged below the second elastic body <b>18</b>. On the outer periphery of this diaphragm <b>22</b>, a ring member <b>21</b> is vulcanized and bonded, and this ring member <b>21</b> is fixed to the crimping fixed portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>together with the outer peripheral portions of the first and second orifice formation members <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. Because of deflection of the second elastic body <b>18</b> and the diaphragm <b>22</b>, the movable member <b>20</b> is capable of moving up and down together with the first and second cap members <b>19</b>, <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thus, between the first elastic body <b>14</b> and the second elastic body <b>18</b>, a first liquid chamber <b>24</b>, in which liquid is sealed, is defined, and between the second elastic body <b>18</b> and the diaphragm <b>22</b>, a second liquid chamber <b>25</b>, in which liquid is likewise sealed, is defined. These first and second liquid chambers <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> communicate with each other via an upper orifice <b>26</b> and a lower orifice <b>27</b> formed by the first to third orifice formation members <b>15</b> to <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The upper orifice <b>26</b> is defined over a little less than one round thereof between the first and second orifice formation members <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and a partition wall <b>26</b><i>a </i>for constituting opposite end walls of the upper orifice <b>26</b> is welded between the first and second orifice formation members <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. The upper orifice <b>26</b> communicates with the first liquid chamber <b>24</b> via a through-hole <b>15</b><i>a </i>in the first orifice formation member <b>15</b> on one side of the partition wall <b>26</b><i>a, </i>and communicates with the lower orifice <b>27</b> via a through-hole <b>16</b><i>a </i>in the second orifice formation member <b>16</b> on the other side of the partition wall <b>26</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The lower orifice <b>27</b> is defined over a little less than one round thereof between the second and third orifice formation members <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and a partition wall <b>27</b><i>a </i>for constituting both end walls of the lower orifice <b>27</b> is welded between the first and second orifice formation members <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. The upper orifice <b>26</b> communicates with the upper orifice <b>26</b> via the through-hole <b>16</b><i>a </i>on one side of the partition wall <b>27</b><i>a</i>, and communicates with the second liquid chamber <b>25</b> via a through-hole <b>17</b><i>a </i>of the third orifice formation member <b>17</b> on the other side of the partition wall <b>27</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the first and second liquid chambers <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> are caused to communicate with each other via the upper and lower orifices <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> which have been connected with each other in series.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To the crimping fixed portion <b>13</b><i>a</i>, a tube-shaped bracket <b>28</b> is also fixed, and this is fixed to the body frame F, whereby the active type vibration isolating support system M is installed to the body frame F. This tube-shaped bracket <b>28</b> and the outer tube <b>13</b> constitute a supporting casing C of the active type vibration isolating support system M.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To the tube-shaped bracket <b>28</b>, an actuator supporting member <b>30</b> is fixed, and the electromagnetic actuator <b>31</b> for driving the movable member <b>20</b> is supported by this actuator supporting member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the actuator <b>31</b> has a closed-end tube-shaped housing <b>32</b> made of magnetic material, the upper surface of which has been opened, and a flange <b>32</b><i>a </i>formed at the upper end thereof is fixed to the actuator supporting member <b>30</b>. The housing <b>32</b> is magnetic material, within which there are installed the fixed core <b>33</b>, the coil assembly <b>34</b> and the upper yoke <b>35</b> in order. The fixed core <b>33</b> has an attracted surface <b>33</b><i>a </i>in an upper part thereof, a positioning shaft <b>33</b><i>b </i>protruding on an underside thereof, and a stepped collar-shaped lower yoke <b>36</b> formed at the outer periphery. The lower yoke <b>36</b> is brought into close contact with the bottom wall <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>32</b> so that the positioning shaft <b>33</b><i>b </i>is pressed into the positioning hole <b>37</b> in the bottom wall <b>32</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the fixed core <b>33</b> is fixed to the housing <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The coil assembly <b>34</b> has a bobbin <b>38</b> made of synthetic resin to be arranged at the outer periphery of the fixed core <b>33</b>, and a coil <b>39</b> to be wound around this bobbin <b>38</b>. On the outer periphery of the lower flange of the bobbin <b>38</b>, a small strut <b>38</b><i>a </i>protruding downward is projectingly provided. During molding of this small strut <b>38</b><i>a</i>, a proximal end portion of the coupler terminal <b>40</b> is insert-connected to the small strut <b>38</b><i>a</i>. Around the small strut <b>38</b><i>a</i>, an outgoing line <b>39</b><i>a </i>of the coil <b>39</b> is wound, the tip end of which is connected to the coupler terminal <b>40</b> by means of soldering, electric welding or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">After the outgoing line <b>39</b><i>a </i>is connected to the coupler terminal <b>40</b>, in order to seal the coil <b>39</b> to the bobbin <b>38</b>, a tube-shaped coil cover <b>41</b> which comes into close contact from the upper and lower end surfaces of the bobbin <b>38</b> to the outer peripheral surface of the coil <b>39</b> is injection-molded using synthetic resin. On that occasion, on this coil cover <b>41</b>, there are integrally formed a coupler <b>42</b> for holding the coupler terminal <b>40</b> to protrude outward in the radial direction of the cover <b>41</b>, and a protruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>for enveloping the outgoing line <b>39</b><i>a </i>from the small strut <b>38</b><i>a </i>to protrude on the lower end surface of the cover <b>41</b>. This coupler <b>42</b> is arranged so as to expose outside the housing <b>32</b> through an aperture <b>43</b> provided from the bottom wall <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>32</b> to the peripheral wall (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). The protruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>is arranged within the aperture <b>43</b> so as to be adjacent to the bottom wall <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the upper end surface of the coil assembly <b>34</b>, particularly on the upper end surface of the coil cover <b>41</b>, there is mounted an annular sealing member <b>45</b>. Also, on the lower end surface of the coil assembly <b>34</b>, particularly on the lower end surfaces of the bobbin <b>38</b> and the coil cover <b>41</b>, a plurality of sealing convex ridges <b>46</b>, <b>46</b> which surround the fixed core <b>33</b> for concentrically lining up are integrally formed. Between their lower end surfaces and thin outer peripheral portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>of the lower yoke <b>36</b>, there is interposed an elastic plate <b>47</b>. This elastic plate <b>47</b> is molded with elastic material such as NBR or silicone rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The upper yoke <b>35</b> is fixed to the inner peripheral surface of the housing <b>32</b> by press-fitting in order to press and hold the coil assembly <b>34</b> toward the lower yoke <b>36</b>. With the fixing, the sealing member <b>41</b> and the elastic plate <b>47</b> are compressed, whereby the coil assembly <b>34</b> is elastically supported without looseness between the upper yoke <b>35</b> and the lower yoke <b>36</b>, so that vibration resistance of the coil assembly <b>34</b> and water resistance of the coil <b>39</b> are improved. Particularly, since the sealing convex ridges <b>46</b>, <b>46</b> of the bobbin <b>38</b> and the coil cover <b>41</b> on the lower end surface cut into the upper surface of the elastic plate <b>47</b> to further reliably seal the elastic plate <b>47</b>, when rain water or washing water enters the aperture <b>43</b> from the outside to accumulate at the bottom of the housing <b>32</b>, even if contact between the coil cover <b>41</b>, and the coil <b>39</b> and the bobbin <b>38</b> is insufficient, it is possible to reliably prevent water from entering the inner periphery side of the bobbin <b>38</b>, to say nothing of entering the coil <b>39</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">On the inner peripheral surface of a cylindrical portion <b>35</b><i>a </i>to be arranged on the inner periphery of the bobbin <b>38</b> of the upper yoke <b>35</b>, a thin tube-shaped bearing member <b>50</b> is slidably fitted. At the upper end of this bearing member <b>50</b>, an inwardly-facing flange <b>50</b><i>a </i>pointing inwardly in the radial direction is integrally formed, while at the lower end thereof, an outwardly-facing flange <b>50</b><i>b </i>pointing outwardly in the radial direction is integrally formed. The outwardly-facing flange <b>50</b><i>b </i>is superimposed on the thick inner peripheral portion <b>36</b><i>b </i>of the lower yoke <b>36</b> through the annular elastic plate <b>51</b>, and between this outwardly-facing flange <b>50</b><i>b </i>and the fixed core <b>33</b>, a set spring <b>52</b> made of coil spring is provided in a compressed state, whereby the bearing member <b>50</b> is elastically held on the lower yoke <b>36</b> for vibration isolation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also, when the movable core <b>53</b> descends on the fixed core <b>33</b> side, the elastic plate <b>51</b> also serves as a descending stopper for the movable core <b>53</b>, which receives the lower end of the movable core <b>53</b> as a cushion in order to avoid collision between both cores <b>33</b>, <b>53</b> and defines a descending limit thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Slidably fitted to the bearing member <b>50</b> is the movable core <b>53</b> having an attracted surface <b>53</b><i>a </i>opposed to an attracted surface <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the fixed core <b>33</b> through the air gap. The upper end of a connecting bolt <b>55</b> which loosely penetrates a comparatively large-diameter through-hole <b>54</b> opened at the central part of this movable core <b>53</b> is threadably attached to the movable member <b>20</b>. At the lower end portion of the connecting bolt <b>55</b>, an adjustment nut <b>56</b> of the movable core <b>53</b> for supporting the lower end surface around the through-hole <b>54</b> is threadedly engaged. On that occasion, the set spring <b>57</b> for holding the movable core <b>53</b> at a supporting position by the adjustment nut <b>56</b> is provided between the movable member <b>20</b> and the movable core <b>53</b> in a compressed state. Thus, the movable core <b>53</b> is elastically interposed between the set spring <b>57</b> and an adjustment nut <b>56</b> threadedly engaged with the connecting bolt <b>55</b> made integral with the movable member <b>20</b>. On the upper end surface of the adjustment nut <b>56</b> held in press contact with the movable core <b>53</b>, a radial ventilating groove <b>58</b> communicating with the through-hole <b>54</b> is formed in such a manner that when the movable core is moving up and down, air can be smoothly circulated in space above and below it.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thus, if a threaded position of the adjustment nut <b>56</b> with the connecting bolt <b>55</b> is advanced and retreated, up and down positions of the movable core <b>53</b>, that is, the air gap g between attracted surfaces <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the movable core <b>53</b> and the fixed core <b>33</b> can be adjusted by corporation with the set spring <b>57</b>. An adjustment position of the adjustment nut <b>56</b> is threadedly engaged with and tightly fastened from below by the adjustment nut <b>56</b>, and is fixed by a lock screw <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, a threaded portion of the connecting bolt <b>55</b> has a normal right-hand thread, whereas in the threaded portion of the lock screw <b>59</b>, a left-hand thread is formed. Therefore, if in a state in which the adjustment nut <b>56</b> is held at a predetermined adjustment position by a tool, the lock screw <b>59</b> is fastened in by another tool, torque of the lock screw <b>59</b> is transmitted to the connecting bolt <b>55</b> through friction so that the connecting bolt <b>55</b> is drawn in on the lock screw <b>59</b> side. Therefore, it is possible to reliably lock at the adjustment position of the adjustment nut <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At the central portion of the fixed core <b>33</b>, an adjustment operating hole <b>60</b> for allowing the adjustment nut <b>56</b> to go in and out is provided, and by means of a tool inserted into this adjustment operating hole <b>60</b>, the lock screw <b>59</b> and the adjustment nut <b>56</b> are adapted able to be operated. The adjustment operating hole <b>60</b> is composed of a threaded hole <b>60</b><i>a </i>and a fitting hole <b>60</b><i>c </i>having a diameter larger than that of the threaded hole <b>60</b><i>a</i>, continuing to the lower end of the threaded hole <b>60</b><i>a </i>through an annular shoulder portion <b>60</b><i>b</i>. On the other hand, a peg body <b>61</b> closing the adjustment operating hole <b>60</b> is shaped like a bottomed tube with its upper end opened, and has a threaded tube <b>61</b><i>a </i>to be threadedly engaged with the threaded hole <b>60</b><i>a </i>while receiving the adjustment nut <b>56</b>, a collar portion <b>61</b><i>b </i>to be fitted in a fitting hole <b>60</b><i>c</i>, and a bottom portion <b>61</b><i>c</i>. On the outer periphery of the collar portion <b>61</b><i>b</i>, there is mounted a sealing member <b>64</b> which comes into close contact with the inner peripheral surface of the fitting hole <b>60</b><i>c</i>. At the underside of the bottom portion <b>61</b><i>c</i>, there is formed a polygonal tool engaging projection <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Until the collar portion <b>61</b><i>b </i>fitted in the fitting hole <b>60</b><i>c </i>abuts against the shoulder portion <b>60</b><i>b</i>, the threaded tube <b>61</b><i>a </i>is threadedly engaged with and tightly fastened to the threaded hole <b>60</b><i>a</i>, whereby the adjustment operating hole <b>60</b> can be closed watertightly by the peg body <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">On the upper surface of the bottom portion <b>61</b><i>c </i>of this peg body <b>61</b>, the elastic plate <b>63</b> is bonded, and the bottom portion <b>61</b><i>c </i>receives the lower end of the adjustment nut <b>56</b> through this elastic plate <b>63</b> as a cushion to define a descending limit of the movable member <b>20</b>. However, when the adjustment nut <b>56</b> abuts against the bottom portion <b>61</b><i>c </i>of the peg body <b>61</b>, the movable member <b>20</b> further descends while the movable member <b>20</b> compresses the set spring <b>57</b> after the movable core <b>53</b> reaches the above-described descending limit by descending of the movable member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Within the bearing member <b>50</b>, each of attracted surfaces <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the fixed core <b>33</b> and the movable core <b>53</b> which oppose to each other is formed in a conical surface so as to define a conical tube-shaped air gap g therebetween, and is arranged so that the attracted surface <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the movable core <b>53</b> surrounds the attracted surface <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the fixed core <b>33</b>. Therefore, even in the fixed core <b>33</b> and the movable core <b>53</b> within the bearing member <b>50</b>, each having a comparatively small diameter within the bearing member <b>50</b>, it is possible to acquire a comparatively strong attraction force and a comparatively long stroke of the movable core <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Moreover, since the attracted surface <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the movable core <b>53</b> is to be formed on the inner peripheral surface side of the core <b>53</b>, a supporting span of the movable core <b>53</b> by the bearing member <b>50</b> can be secured sufficiently long irrespective of the attracted surface <b>53</b><i>a</i>, and stable ascent and descent of the movable core <b>53</b> can be ensured. In this case, it is effective in acquiring further stable, smooth ascent and descent of the movable core <b>53</b> that the outer peripheral surface of the movable core <b>53</b> is formed with a low friction material layer made of Teflon or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The set spring <b>57</b> is made of coil spring, and by fitting it to a large-diameter portion <b>55</b><i>a </i>at the base of the connecting bolt <b>55</b>, the set spring <b>57</b> is arranged concentrically with the connecting bolt <b>55</b>. Also, between this set spring <b>57</b> and the movable core <b>53</b>, there is interposed an annular spring seat <b>65</b> made of steel plate in order to prevent the movable core <b>53</b> from wearing. This spring seat <b>65</b> has inner and outer concentric positioning tubular portions <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> which stand up along the inner peripheral surface and outer peripheral surface of the set spring <b>57</b> from the inner peripheral edge portion and outer peripheral edge portion, and the outside positioning tubular portion <b>67</b> is formed longer than the inside positioning tubular portion <b>66</b>. In order to facilitate insertion of the set spring <b>57</b> between these positioning tubular portions <b>66</b>, <b>67</b>, there are formed funnel portions <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>67</b><i>a </i>at the upper end portions of the positioning tubular portions <b>66</b>, <b>67</b>. Also, on at least one of abutted surfaces in which this spring seat <b>65</b> and the movable core <b>53</b> oppose to each other, a low friction material layer of Teflon or the like is formed to thereby make sliding property of the spring seat <b>65</b> to the movable core <b>53</b> excellent.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to a coil <b>39</b> of the actuator <b>31</b>, an electronic control unit U is connected through a coupler <b>42</b>, and to this electronic control unit U, there is inputted each detection signal of a rotation speed sensor Sa for detecting engine rotation speed, a load sensor Sb for detecting a load to be inputted into an active type vibration isolating support system M, and an acceleration sensor Sc for detecting acceleration that is exerted on an engine E.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, the description will be made of an operation of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the actuator <b>31</b> of the active type vibration isolating support system M is in a non-operating state, although the first and second liquid chambers <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> which communicate with each other through the upper and lower orifices <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> are kept at the same pressure since a pressure receiving area in the fist liquid chamber <b>24</b> of the first cap member <b>19</b> connected to the movable member <b>20</b> is larger than a pressure receiving area in the second liquid chamber <b>25</b>, a downward load obtained by multiplying the difference in area by pressure in the first liquid chamber <b>24</b> is exerted on the movable member <b>20</b>. When a balance is established between the load and a repulsion force of the second elastic body <b>18</b> against it, the movable member <b>20</b> comes to a halt, forming a predetermined initial air gap g between adsorption surfaces <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the fixed core <b>33</b> and the movable core <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When shake vibration of low frequency occurs in the engine E during running of an automobile, the first elastic body <b>14</b> is deformed because of a load inputted from the engine E to change capacity of the first liquid chamber <b>24</b>. Then, the liquid goes and comes between the first and second liquid chambers <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> which communicate with each other through the upper and lower orifices <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>. When the capacity of the first liquid chamber <b>24</b> is enlarged and reduced, the capacity of the second liquid chamber <b>25</b> is reduced and enlarged accordingly, and the variations in capacity of this second liquid chamber <b>25</b> are absorbed by elastic deformation of a diaphragm <b>22</b>. At this time, since shapes and dimensions of the upper and lower orifices <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> and spring constant of the first elastic body <b>14</b> have been set so as to show high spring constant and a high attenuation force in a frequency domain of the shake vibration, vibration to be transmitted from the engine E to the body frame F can be effectively reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In such a shake vibration domain of low frequency of the engine E, the actuator <b>31</b> is kept in a non-operating state.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When vibration of a frequency higher than the shake vibration, that is, idle vibration or booming noise vibration that occurs during idling of the engine E occurs, liquid within the upper and lower orifices <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> which connect the first and second liquid chambers <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> enters a stick state, so that the engine E becomes unable to exhibit a vibration isolating function. In such a case, the actuator <b>31</b> is driven to exhibit the vibration isolating function.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In other words, the electronic control unit U controls energizing to a coil <b>39</b> of the actuator <b>31</b> on the basis of a detection signal inputted from the engine rotation speed sensor Sa, the load sensor Sb, the acceleration sensor Sc and the like. Specifically, when the engine E leans is displaced downward because of vibration and the capacity of the first-liquid chamber <b>24</b> is reduced due to the downward deformation of the first elastic body <b>14</b> to raise the liquid pressure, the coil <b>39</b> is energized to attract the movable core <b>53</b> on the fixed core <b>33</b> side. As a result, the movable core <b>53</b> descends while deforming the second elastic body <b>18</b> so that the capacity of the first liquid chamber <b>24</b> is enlarged, whereby it is possible to restrict the rise in pressure in the chamber <b>24</b>, and after all, the active type vibration isolating support system M generates an active supporting force for preventing the downward load from the engine E to the body frame F from being transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">On the other hand, when the engine E is displaced upward and the capacity of the first liquid chamber <b>24</b> is enlarged to raise the pressure in the chamber <b>24</b>, the coil <b>39</b> is demagnetized to release the movable core <b>53</b>. As a result, the movable core <b>53</b> rises due to the repulsion force of the second elastic body <b>18</b> so that the capacity of the first liquid chamber <b>24</b> is reduced, whereby it is possible to restrict the drop in pressure in the chamber <b>24</b>, and after all, the active type vibration isolating support system M generates an active supporting force for preventing the upward load from the engine E to the body frame F from being transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">During such an operation, when with an excessive increase in the downward load from the engine E to the first elastic body <b>14</b>, the pressure in the fist liquid chamber <b>24</b> is abruptly increased to apply the excessive downward load to the movable member <b>20</b>, the movable member <b>20</b> first descends the movable core <b>53</b> to its descent limit, that is, until the lower end surface of the core <b>53</b> is abutted against the elastic plate <b>51</b> on the thick inner peripheral portion <b>36</b><i>b </i>of the lower yoke <b>36</b>. Thereafter, the set spring <b>57</b> is compressed and becomes deformed so that the adjustment nut <b>56</b> is moved away from the underside of the movable core <b>53</b>, whereby the movable member <b>20</b> is allowed to further move toward the fixed core <b>33</b> side. Accordingly, by causing the set spring <b>57</b> to absorb the excessive load of the movable member <b>20</b>, it is possible to prevent mutual contact between the fixed core <b>33</b> and the movable core <b>53</b>, and the excessive load acting on the movable core <b>53</b> and the elastic plate <b>51</b>, and to secure their durability.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus, if after the movable core <b>53</b> reaches the descent limit, the movable member <b>20</b> descends by a predetermined amount, the adjustment nut <b>56</b> will abut against a bottom portion <b>61</b><i>c </i>of the peg body <b>61</b> fixed to the fixed core <b>33</b> through the elastic plate <b>63</b> to restrict any excessive increase in the load on the set spring <b>57</b>, thereby preventing any increase in over-load on the fixed core <b>33</b> and the movable core <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Characteristics in thrust and displacement of the movable member <b>20</b> of the active type vibration isolating support system M are dependent on an initial air gap g between attracted surfaces <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the fixed core <b>33</b> and the movable cores <b>33</b>, <b>53</b> in a non-operating state of the actuator <b>31</b>. However, the initial air gap g may not be within the tolerance due to accumulated manufacturing errors of each portion from the installation area of the second elastic body <b>18</b> to the movable core <b>53</b>. In such a case, a threaded position of the adjustment nut <b>56</b> with respect to the connecting bolt <b>55</b> is advanced and retreated as described above, whereby the initial air gap g can be adjusted properly and easily. Therefore, by energizing the coil <b>39</b>, it becomes possible to impart predetermined thrust and displacement to the movable member <b>20</b> with high precision, to thereby improve the performance of the active type vibration isolating support system M.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Also, if plural types of active type vibration isolating support systems M having different initial air gaps g between the fixed core <b>33</b> and the movable cores <b>33</b>, <b>53</b> are prepared by operating the adjustment nut <b>56</b>, it will be possible to easily obtain active type vibration isolating support systems M having characteristics corresponding to plural car models, thereby contributing to reduction of cost.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Moreover, since the adjustment nut <b>56</b> is operated through the adjustment operating hole <b>60</b> of the fixed core <b>33</b> opened outside the housing <b>32</b>, the initial air gap g can be accurately adjusted without regard to assembly errors in each portion after the completion of assembly of the active type vibration isolating support system M.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Although the fixed core <b>33</b> becomes hollow because it has the adjustment operating hole <b>60</b>, the positioning shaft <b>33</b><i>b </i>integral therewith is pressed into the positioning hole <b>37</b> in the bottom wall <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>32</b> and the flange-shaped lower yoke <b>36</b> is brought into close contact with the bottom wall <b>32</b><i>b</i>, whereby the fixed core <b>33</b> is firmly reinforced, and even if it receives an abutting shock from the movable core <b>53</b>, is capable of withstanding the shock sufficiently and besides causes no position shift. Moreover, since the lower yoke <b>36</b> effectively increases magnetic paths around the coil assembly <b>34</b> in cooperation with the housing <b>32</b> and the upper yoke <b>35</b>, the attracting force between the fixed and movable cores <b>33</b>, <b>53</b> can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On the other hand, an ascent limit of the movable core <b>53</b> is defined by its upper end abutting against an inward flange <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the bearing member <b>50</b>. When the movable core <b>53</b> abuts against the inward flange <b>50</b><i>a </i>shockingly, the impulse force is transmitted to the set spring <b>52</b> through the bearing member <b>50</b> and the outward flange <b>50</b><i>b</i>, to be absorbed by the elasticity of the set spring <b>52</b>. Therefore, the set spring <b>52</b> also serves as an impulse absorbing member which protects the movable core <b>53</b> and the bearing member <b>50</b> from the impulse force.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Since the movable core <b>53</b> is elastically held on the adjustment nut <b>56</b> by the set spring <b>57</b> and an adequate play is provided between the inner surface of the through-hole <b>54</b> in the movable core <b>53</b> and the connecting bolt <b>55</b>, the movable core <b>53</b> and the connecting bolt <b>55</b> are capable of relatively oscillating. Therefore, when during an operation of the active type vibration isolating support system M, a load in an inclined direction is applied to the movable member <b>20</b>, it is possible to prevent the movable core <b>53</b> from inclining for maintaining a good sliding relationship with the bearing member <b>50</b> by means of the oscillation of the connecting bolt <b>55</b>. In this case, with the oscillation of the connecting bolt <b>55</b>, the set spring <b>57</b> moves sideways more or less, however, between this set spring <b>57</b> and the movable core <b>53</b>, there is interposed a spring seat <b>65</b> for holding the lower end portion of the set spring <b>57</b>, and yet, on an abutted surface between the spring seat <b>65</b> and the movable core <b>53</b>, there is formed a low friction material layer. Thus, the spring seat <b>65</b> smoothly slides on the upper surface of the movable core <b>53</b> along with the set spring <b>57</b>, thereby effectively suppressing production of abrasion powder from the movable core <b>53</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent trouble resulting from the abrasion powder, in such a case where the abrasion powder enters sliding portions of the bearing member <b>50</b> and the movable core <b>53</b> to hinder the movement of the movable core <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">With very simple structure in which a set spring <b>52</b> is provided in a compressed state between the outward flange <b>50</b><i>b </i>at the lower end of the bearing member <b>50</b> and the upper yoke <b>35</b>, the bearing member <b>50</b> is installed at a fixed position on the lower yoke <b>36</b>. Therefore, no high precision is needed for the installation, and the cost can be reduced. Moreover, since the set spring <b>52</b> is to be arranged on the outer periphery side of the bearing member <b>50</b>, even if friction powder occurs between this set spring <b>52</b> and a portion against which the set spring <b>52</b> presses, it is possible to prevent the friction powder from entering the bearing member <b>50</b>. Particularly since between the outward flange <b>50</b><i>b </i>and the lower yoke <b>36</b>, there is interposed an elastic plate <b>51</b> which is brought into close contact with them, it is possible to reliably prevent the friction powder from entering the bearing member <b>50</b> by the elastic plate <b>51</b>, and the bearing member <b>50</b> is capable of exhibiting excellent guidance property for the movable core <b>53</b> over a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Also, since a repulsion force of the set spring <b>52</b> is supported by the upper yoke <b>35</b> continuing to the housing <b>32</b> and is not exerted on the movable core <b>53</b>, it is possible to prevent loss of an effective attracting force between the fixed and movable cores <b>33</b>, <b>53</b> due to the repulsion force of the set spring <b>52</b>, thereby improving the output performance of the movable core <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the coil assembly <b>34</b>, since there is molded a coil cover <b>41</b> which is brought into close contact with outer peripheral surfaces of the coil <b>39</b> and the bobbin <b>38</b> so as to seal the coil <b>39</b> to the bobbin <b>38</b>, it is possible to enhance water resistance of the coil <b>39</b>. Moreover, since on the coil cover <b>41</b>, there has been integrally formed a coupler <b>42</b> for holding the coupler terminal <b>40</b> to protrude outward in the radial direction, there is no need for a lead wire to be connected to the coil <b>39</b> and a coupler holder for supporting the coupler, so that a number of components and assembly man-hour are reduced, and the cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Also, on one end surface of the bobbin <b>38</b>, there is integrally formed a small strut <b>38</b><i>a </i>for insert-connecting a proximal end portion of the coupler terminal <b>40</b>; around this small strut <b>38</b><i>a</i>, there is wound an outgoing line <b>39</b><i>a </i>of the coil <b>39</b> to be connected to the coupler terminal <b>40</b>; and thereafter, a protruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>for enveloping the small strut <b>38</b><i>a </i>and the outgoing line <b>39</b><i>a </i>to protrude from the lower end surface of the coil cover <b>41</b> is integrally formed with the coil cover <b>41</b> together with the coupler <b>42</b>. Therefore, the outgoing line <b>39</b><i>a </i>of the coil <b>39</b> is wound around the small strut <b>38</b><i>a</i>, whereby it is possible to mold the coil cover <b>41</b>, the coupler <b>42</b> and the protruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>while reliably preventing the outgoing line <b>39</b><i>a </i>from loosening.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the coupler <b>42</b> is further exposed to the outside through an aperture <b>43</b> provided from the peripheral wall of the housing <b>32</b> over to the bottom wall <b>32</b><i>b</i>, the protruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>is arranged at the aperture <b>43</b> so as to be adjacent to the bottom wall <b>32</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, there is no need for the provision of accommodation space for the protruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>in the housing <b>32</b>, and the protruded portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>needs not be overhung over the outer surface of the housing <b>32</b>, whereby the actuator <b>31</b> can be made compact.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, but it is possible to change the design in various ways without departing from the gist of the invention. For example, in the above-described embodiments, the movable member <b>20</b> and the connecting bolt <b>55</b> are integrated by forming them as separate members and threadably connecting together, but the members <b>20</b>, <b>55</b> may be integrally constructed from the same material. Also, the fitted portion between the positioning shaft <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the fixed core <b>33</b> and the positioning hole <b>37</b> in the bottom wall <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>32</b> may be fixed by welding instead of press-fitting.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This nonprovisional application claims the benefit of International Application No. PCT/JP01/11439, filed Dec. 26, 2001. The disclosure of the prior application is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a surface acoustic wave device, and more particularly to a surface acoustic wave device which can implement the attenuation characteristic outside the pass band and the narrow band characteristics, and is preferable for use as a filter.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently radio devices, including portable telephones, cordless telephones and radio sets, are constantly becoming smaller and lighter, and their use is spreading rapidly. For the high frequency circuits of these radio devices, filter elements are used as critical key devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore corresponding to the demands of smaller size and light weight for radio devices, smaller and lighter filter elements are demanded. As a configuration to make a filter element smaller and lighter, a surface acoustic wave device is used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the surface acoustic wave device is used as a filter, a critical issue is decreasing the insertion loss and increasing the attenuation amount outside the pass band in order to allow necessary signals to pass and to remove unnecessary signals. Also as the number of components decreases for downsizing the radio device main body, characteristics demanded for the surface acoustic wave device are becoming critical.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The surface acoustic wave device in the configuration example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes an interdigital transducer (IDT) <b>1</b> and reflectors <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, which are formed by electrode finger patterns provided on the piezoelectric substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the interdigital transducer (IDT) <b>1</b> includes three individual IDTs (these are hereafter called drive electrodes <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>), and the drive electrodes <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> are connected in parallel to the input terminal IN. The drive electrode <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> is connected to the output terminal OUT. The drive electrodes <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> and the input terminal IN, and the output terminal OUT are connected respectively by lead wires which are connected to the electrode pad <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the reflectors <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, which are disposed on both sides of the interdigital transducer <b>1</b>, constitute a conventional grating electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this configuration, one possible method for implementing a narrower band is increasing the number of electrode fingers of the interdigital transducer <b>1</b>. This however increases insertion loss. Another method of implementing a narrower band is decreasing stop band width by decreasing the reflection coefficient of the reflection electrodes <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, but this also has a tendency to increase insertion loss accordingly.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With the foregoing in view, the present inventor continued research and development on the configuration of the surface acoustic wave device which implements a narrower band without increasing insertion loss, and discovered that attenuation outside the pass band can be increased without increasing insertion loss, and fine filter characteristics in a narrow band can be implemented by forming the reflection electrode <b>2</b> and the reflection electrode <b>3</b> as blocks with different reflection coefficients.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore based on this discovery, an object of the present invention is to provide a surface acoustic wave device which can decrease insertion loss in the pass band and present good narrow band characteristics.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The embodiments shown in the drawings are for describing the present invention, and application of the present invention is not limited to these.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an embodiment of the present invention, and just like the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, electrode fingers, of which the main component is Al, are formed on the LiTa<b>0</b><sub>3 </sub>or LiNb<b>0</b><sub>3 </sub>piezoelectric substrate <b>100</b>, and the interdigital transducer (IDT) <b>1</b>, which has three drive electrodes <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>, is cascade-connected between the two reflectors <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As a feature of the present invention, the difference from the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is that the reflectors <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are comprised of a plurality of blocks having different reflection coefficients. In other words, each one of the reflectors <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> has three blocks with different reflection coefficients, and the blocks with different reflection coefficients are divided into a short electrode block where the electrode fingers are shorted by the electrode pad <b>4</b>, and an open electrode block where the electrode fingers are not connected to the electrode pad <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In other words, in the short electrode block, both ends of the plurality of electrode fingers are connected to the electrode pad <b>4</b> to be shorted, and the open electrode block is formed with independent electrode fingers separated from the electrode pad <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reflector <b>2</b> is comprised of two open electrode blocks, which have open electrodes <b>2</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> respectively, and three short electrode blocks having short electrodes, which are adjacent to the open electrode blocks. In the same way, the reflector <b>3</b> is includes two open blocks having open electrodes <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>2</b> respectively, and three short electrode blocks having short electrodes, which are adjacent to the open electrode blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the present invention, the surface acoustic wave device including the reflectors which have such open electrode blocks and short electrode blocks is characterized by the number of open electrode fingers constituting the open electrode block of the reflectors and the positions thereof, concerning attenuation outside the pass band and the narrow band characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example when the reflector is comprised of 200 electrode fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a configuration of a reflector of prior art, where both ends of all the 200 electrode fingers included in the reflector are commonly shorted by the electrode pads <b>40</b> and <b>41</b>, and is comprised of only one short electrode block. In this case, the reflector has only a single reflection coefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The configuration of this reflector is expressed as (200-0-0-0-0) with the left end of the reflector as a reference. In other words, when the left end is the reference, the reflector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows that the electrode finger at the left end is a short electrode, and the rest of the electrode fingers are also short electrodes, therefore all 200 (100 pairs) electrode fingers are short electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the configuration of the reflector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the two electrode fingers are open electrodes, the next <b>196</b> electrode fingers are short electrodes, and two electrode fingers at the right end are open electrodes when the left end of the reflector is the reference. This configuration is expressed as (0-2-196-2-0).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the four electrode fingers are short electrodes, the next two electrode fingers are open electrodes, and the next 188 electrode fingers are short electrodes when the left end of the reflector is the reference. Then the next two electrode fingers are open electrodes and the next four electrode fingers are short electrodes. This configuration is expressed as (4-2-188-2-4).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the change of the passing characteristic in the surface acoustic wave device when the two reflectors <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are comprised of 156 and 200 electrode fingers respectively, and the position of the pair (two electrode fingers) of open electrodes is changed inward with the left end of the reflectors as the reference. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows passing characteristics as a whole, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a diagram when a part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is enlarged to clarify the difference in each characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As the description in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows, the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;b&#x2019;, which has the reflector <b>3</b> defined by (0-2-196-2-0) or the reflector <b>2</b> defined by (0-2-152-2-0), has a configuration where two open electrodes are disposed on both end sides of the reflector respectively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the same way, the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;c&#x2019;, which has the reflector <b>3</b> defined by (2-2-192-2-2) or the reflected <b>2</b> defined by (2-2-148-2-2), has a configuration where two short electrodes are disposed on both end sides of the reflector and two open electrodes are positioned inside thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;d&#x2019;, which has the reflector <b>3</b> defined by (4-2-188-2-4) or the reflector <b>2</b> defined by (4-2-144-2-4), has four short electrodes at both end sides of the reflector and two open electrodes are positioned inside thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The surface acoustic device &#x2018;e&#x2019;, which has the reflector <b>3</b> defined by (6-2-184-2-6) or the reflector <b>2</b> defined by (6-2-140-2-6), has six short electrodes at both end sides of the reflector and two open electrodes are positioned inside thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;f&#x2019;, which has the reflector <b>3</b> defined by (8-2-180-2-8) or the reflector <b>2</b> defined by (8-2-136-2-8), has a configuration where eight short electrodes are disposed on both end sides of the reflector and two open electrodes are positioned inside thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;g&#x2019;, which has the reflector <b>3</b> defined by (10-2-176-2-10) or the reflector <b>2</b> defined by (10-2-132-2-10), has a configuration where ten short electrodes are disposed on both end sides of the reflector and two open electrodes are positioned inside thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As the characteristic diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows, the passing characteristic changes by positioning the open electrodes inside of both the ends with respect to the characteristic of the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;a&#x2019; when all electrode fingers are short electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">By this change of the passing characteristic, the attenuation and shape factor outside the pass band changes. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows, in the passing characteristic of the conventional surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;a&#x2019; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> where all electrode fingers are short electrodes, the attenuation outside the pass band is &#x2212;25dB when the frequency value normalized by the central frequency (f/f<sub>0</sub>)=0.975.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Here if the ratio between the band width (3 dBBW) at the minimum attenuation (&#x2212;3 dB) and the band width (25 dBBW) at attenuation outside the passing band (&#x2212;25 dB) is defined as the shape factor, then the shape factor with respect to the characteristic of the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;a&#x2019; when all electrode fingers are short electrodes is 0.537.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As the shape factor becomes closer to 1, the attenuation characteristic outside the pass band near the pass band width becomes sharper, which is a good narrow band characteristic.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows, when the open electrode positions of the reflector are in a range of the first to eleventh electrode fingers from both end sides, both the attenuation characteristic II and the shape factor characteristic I outside the passing band can be improved compared with the characteristics of the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;a&#x2019; which has a reflector with all short electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Here based on the research of the present inventor, it was discovered that the shape factor and the attenuation outside the pass band can be improved by increasing the number of pairs of the open electrodes compared with the case of having a reflector where all open electrodes.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows, in the case of increasing the number of open electrodes as well, the passing characteristic is changed by increasing the number of open electrodes with compared with the characteristics of the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;a&#x2019; which has a reflector with all short electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a graph indicating the simulation results of the changes of the attenuation and the shape factor outside the pass band in the surface acoustic wave devices &#x2018;h&#x2019; to &#x2018;L&#x2019;, which have reflectors where the number of open electrodes is increased respectively, compared with the characteristics of the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;a&#x2019;, which has a reflector with all short electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The shape factor in the surface acoustic wave device which has a reflector with all short electrodes is 0.54, and compared with this, the shape factor improves by increasing the number of open electrodes. On the other hand, the attenuation outside the band decreases if the number of open electrodes is increased, but when the number of open electrodes is four to eight, the shape factor in the surface acoustic wave device which has a reflector with all short electrodes is improved more than 0.54, and attenuation can be 25 dB or more.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The above example shows the case when the open electrode fingers in the reflector are arranged symmetrically. However application of the present invention is not limited to the case when the open electrode fingers are arranged symmetrically.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram depicting the arrangement of the open electrode fingers in reflectors, where <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is the case when the open electrode fingers in the reflector are arranged symmetrically, and corresponds to the reflector of the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;d&#x2019; in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (or the reflector of the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;i&#x2019; in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The configuration of the reflector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, on the other hand, is that four short electrode fingers are disposed at the left end, and two open electrode fingers are disposed inside thereof. And short electrode fingers are disposed from inside the two open electrode fingers up to the right end, and the arrangement of the electrode fingers is asymmetrical.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a graph comparing the pass band characteristic of the surface acoustic wave device when the open electrode fingers are disposed symmetrically and when they are disposed asymmetrically.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The reflector of the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;m&#x2019; has a configuration where four short electrode fingers are disposed from both ends, and two open electrode fingers are disposed inside thereof, which is the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Whereas the reflector of the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;n&#x2019; has an asymmetrical configuration where four short electrode fingers are disposed at the left end, two open electrode fingers are disposed inside thereof, and short electrode fingers are disposed from inside the two open electrode fingers up to the right end.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the comparison of the surface acoustic wave device &#x2018;m&#x2019; and &#x2018;n&#x2019;, and the comparison of the surface acoustic wave devices &#x2018;o&#x2019; and &#x2018;p&#x2019;, the surface acoustic wave device where the open electrode fingers of the reflector are disposed symmetrically has a larger attenuation outside the pass band in both cases.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">However, by the configuration where the reflector has open electrode fingers according to the present invention, the attenuation outside the band is improved, and a narrower band can be implemented compared with the case when the electrode fingers of the reflector are all short electrodes. Therefore the application of the present invention is not limited to the case when open electrode fingers are disposed symmetrically in the reflector of the surface acoustic wave device.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to an organic electroluminescence element used for a light emission device in various apparatuses and an exposure unit as well as an image-forming apparatus using the element.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">An electroluminescence element is a light emission device using electric field-induced light emission of a solid luminescent material. Now, inorganic electroluminescence elements that use inorganic materials as the light emitter are in practical use, and expansion of their applications to the backlight for liquid crystal displays or flat panel displays are intended in some segments. However, the voltage required for the light emission of inorganic electroluminescence elements is rather high, i.e., 100 v or higher. In addition, due to the difficulty in blue light emission, it is difficult to achieve full color emission based on the three primary colors of R, G and B. Moreover, since the refractive index of the material used as the light emitter of an inorganic electroluminescence element is very high, the emission light is strongly affected by the effect of the total reflection at boundaries. Accordingly, the efficiency of taking out the actually emitted light into the air is as low as roughly 10 to 20%, which value is difficult to improve.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">On the other hand, studies on electroluminescence elements using organic materials have called attention for a long time. Though various investigations have been made, they never evolved to a full-scale study for practical use because the emission efficiency was extremely low.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">But, in 1987, C. W. Tang et al of Kodak Co. proposed an organic electroluminescence element having a function-separated, stacked structure in which the organic material is divided into two layers, i.e., a hole transport layer and a light emission layer. And it has become evident that, in spite of a low voltage of 10 V or lower, an emission luminance as high as 1000 cd/m<sup>2 </sup>or more is attained (Refer to C. W. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke; Applied Physics Letter (Appl. Phys. Lett.) (USA), Vol. 51, 1987, p. 913.). Since then, organic electroluminescence elements have attracted attention on a sudden. Still now, function separation type organic electroluminescence elements having a similar stacked structure are being actively studied. In particular, efficiency enhancement and life expansion, which are indispensable for the product development of organic electroluminescence elements, are also being thoroughly investigated, resulting in the recent development of displays using organic electroluminescence elements.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">Now, the structure of a conventional, common organic electroluminescence element will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the essential part of a conventional organic electroluminescence element.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the organic electroluminescence element includes an anode <b>52</b> comprising a transparent electro-conductive film such as ITO formed by sputtering or resistive heating vapor deposition on a substrate <b>51</b> made of, for example glass, a hole transport layer <b>53</b> made of, for example, N,N&#x2032;-diphenyl-N,N&#x2032;-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1&#x2032;-diphenyl-4,4&#x2032;-diamine (which will be abbreviated as TPD hereinafter) similarly formed by resistive heating vapor deposition on the anode <b>52</b>, a light emission layer <b>54</b> made of aluminum 8-hydroxyquinoline (which will be abbreviated as Alq<sub>3 </sub>hereinafter) prepared by resistive heating vapor deposition on the hole transport layer <b>53</b>, and a cathode <b>55</b> made of a metallic film with a thickness of 100 to 300 nm formed by resistive heating vapor deposition on the light emission layer <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">When a dc voltage or dc current is applied to the organic electroluminescence element having such structure by making the anode <b>52</b> a positive electrode and the cathode <b>55</b> a negative electrode, holes are injected into the light emission layer <b>54</b> from the anode <b>52</b> via the hole transport layer <b>53</b>, and electrons are injected into the light emission layer <b>54</b> from the cathode <b>55</b>. In the light emission layer <b>54</b>, recombination of the hole and electron takes place; and when an exciton generated by such recombination shifts from the excited state to the ground state, the phenomenon of light emission takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">Generally speaking, in such organic electroluminescence element, the light emitted from the luminescent-material in the light emission layer <b>54</b> radiates omni-directionally from the luminescent material as the center, and emerges into the air through the hole transport layer <b>53</b>, anode <b>52</b> and substrate <b>51</b>. Alternatively, the light once proceeds in the direction opposite to the light emerging direction (the direction toward the substrate <b>51</b>), is reflected at the cathode <b>55</b>, and emerges into the air through the light emission layer <b>54</b>, hole transport layer <b>53</b>, anode <b>52</b> and substrate <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">Regarding the device structure of organic electroluminescence elements, there are some descriptions set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,917,280 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,895.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">In an image-forming apparatus based on electrophotographic technology, an exposure unit is provided which irradiates exposure light corresponding to image data onto a photoreceptor having been charged to a pre-determined uniform potential and records an electrostatic latent image on the photoreceptor. As the conventional exposure method for such exposure unit, those based on laser beams or LED arrays are dominant.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">In the case of laser beam exposure, downsizing of the unit is quite difficult since optical parts such as a polygon mirror or lenses occupy large spaces. In the case of LED array exposure, cost reduction of the unit is difficult because the circuit board is expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">Now, with use of the above-described organic electroluminescence element as the light source, these problems can be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">However, since the light emitted from the organic electroluminescence element is diffusive, it has been impossible to achieve a sufficient level of light quantity required to form an image on a photoreceptor with the diffusive light from the conventional element.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">Accordingly, the object of the invention is to provide an organic electroluminescence element capable of emitting a large light quantity and an exposure unit as well as an image-forming apparatus using the element.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">To solve the above-cited object, the organic electroluminescence element of the invention comprises, provided on a substrate, an anode which acts as a hole injection electrode, a cathode which acts as an electron injection electrode, a plurality of light emission layers each having a light emission region and a charge generation layer which injects electrons into a light emission layer arranged close to the anode and holes into a light emission layer arranged close to the cathode, the light emission layers and the charge generation layer being arranged between the anode and the cathode, and is configured so that the work function of the charge generating layer is set-higher than the ionization potential of the light emission layer arranged close to the anode.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">And to solve the problem, the organic electroluminescence element of the invention comprises, provided on a substrate, an anode which acts as a hole injection electrode, a cathode which acts as an electron injection electrode, a plurality of light emission layers each having a light emission region and a charge generation layer which injects electrons into a light emission layer arranged close to the anode and holes into a light emission layer arranged close to the cathode, the light emission layers and the charge generation layer being arranged between the anode and the cathode, and is configured so that the electron affinity of the charge generation layer is set lower than the electron affinity of the light emission layer arranged close to the anode, and that the ionization potential of the charge generation layer is set higher than the ionization potential of the light emission layer arranged close to the anode.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">To solve the problem, the organic electroluminescence element of the invention further comprises, provided on a substrate, an anode which acts as a hole injection electrode, a cathode which acts as an electron injection electrode, a plurality of light emission layers each having a light emission region and a charge generation layer which injects electrons into a light emission layer arranged close to the anode and holes into a light emission layer arranged close to the cathode, the light emission layers and the charge generation layer being arranged between the anode and the cathode, and is configured so that the potential difference between the electron affinity of the light emission layer arranged close to the anode and the electron affinity of the charge generation layer, and the potential difference between the ionization potential of the light emission layer arranged close to the anode and the ionization potential of the charge generation layer are both set 0.6 eV or less.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0020">To solve the problem, the exposure unit of the invention uses one of the organic electroluminescence elements described above as the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021">To solve the problem, the exposure unit of the invention uses an organic electroluminescence element as the light source, the element comprising, provided on a substrate, an anode acting as a hole injection electrode, a cathode acting as an electron injection electrode, a plurality of light emission layers each having a light emission region and a charge generation layer injecting electrons into a light emission layer arranged close to the anode and injecting holes into a light emission layer arranged close to the cathode, the light emission layers and the charge generation layer being arranged between the anode and the cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">To solve the problem, the exposure unit of the invention uses an organic electro luminescence element as the light source, the element comprising a plurality of anodes acting as hole injection electrodes, a plurality of cathodes arranged alternately with the anodes and acting as electron injection electrodes and a plurality of light emission layers each having a light emission region and arranged between the anode and the cathode, and all these layers being provided on a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">Since light emission takes place in a plurality of light emission layers in such apparatuses, the light quantity emitted by the organic electroluminescence element can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">In addition, since the light quantity emitted by a light emission layer increases due to the enhancement of the efficiency of hole as well as electron injection into the light emission layer, the light quantity emitted by the organic electroluminescence element can be enhanced still further.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">Since light emission takes place in a plurality of light emission layers, an effective result that the light quantity emitted by an organic electroluminescence element is enhanced is attained according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">The invention set forth in Claim <b>1</b> provides an organic electroluminescence element comprising, provided on a substrate, an anode which acts as a hole injection electrode, a cathode which acts as an electron injection electrode, a plurality of light emission layers each having a light emission region and a charge generating layer injecting electrons into a light emission layer arranged close to the anode and injecting holes into a light emission layer arranged close to the cathode, these layers being arranged between the anode and the cathode, and configured so that the work function of the charge generation layer is set higher than the ionization potential of the light emission layer arranged close to the anode. Since light emission takes place in the plural light emission layers, the invention has an effect of enabling the emission light quantity of the organic electroluminescence element to increase. Moreover, since the work function of the charge generation layer is set higher than the ionization potential of the light emission layer lying close to the cathode, the efficiency of hole injection to the light emission layer lying close to the cathode increases, leading to an increase of the light quantity emitted by the light emission layer lying close to the cathode. As a result, the invention has an effect of further enhancing the emission light quantity of the organic electroluminescence element.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">The invention set forth in Claim <b>2</b> provides an organic electroluminescence element comprising, provided on a substrate, an anode which acts as a hole injection electrode, a cathode which acts as an electron injection electrode, a plurality of light emission layers each having a light emission region and a charge generating layer injecting electrons into a light emission layer arranged close to the anode and injecting holes into a light emission layer arranged close to the cathode, these layers being arranged between the anode and the cathode, and configured so that the electron affinity of the charge generation layer is set lower than the electron affinity of the light emission layer arranged close to the anode, and that the ionization potential of the charge generation layer is set higher than the ionization potential of the light emission layer arranged close to the cathode. Since light emission takes place in the plural light emission layers, the invention has an effect of enabling the emission light quantity of the organic electroluminescence element to increase. Moreover, since the electron affinity of the charge generation layer is set lower than that the light emission layer lying close to the anode, and the ionization potential of the charge generation layer higher than that of the light emission layer lying close to the cathode, the efficiencies of hole and electron injections to each light emission layer increase, leading to an increase of the light quantity emitted by these light emission layers. As a result, the invention has an effect of further enhancing the emission light quantity of the organic electroluminescence element.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">The invention set forth in Claim <b>3</b> provides an organic electroluminescence element comprising, provided on a substrate, an anode which acts as a hole injection electrode, a cathode which acts as an electron injection electrode, a plurality of light emission layers each having a light emission region and a charge generating layer injecting electrons into a light emission layer arranged close to the anode and injecting holes into a light emission layer arranged close to the cathode, these layers being arranged between the anode and the cathode, and characterized by that the potential difference between the electron affinity of the light emission layer arranged close to the anode and the electron affinity of the charge generation layer, and the potential difference between the ionization potential of the light emission layer arranged close to the cathode and the ionization potential of the charge generation layer are both set 0.6 eV or less. Since light emission takes place in the plural light emission layers, the invention has an effect of enabling the emission light quantity of the organic electroluminescence element to increase. Moreover, by adopting such a configuration, the efficiencies of hole and electron injections to each light emission layer increase, leading to an increase of the light quantity emitted by these light emission layers. As a result, the invention has an effect of further enhancing the emission light quantity of the organic electroluminescence element.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">The invention set forth in Claim <b>4</b> provides an organic electroluminescence element set forth in Claim <b>1</b> in which the charge generation layer at least consists of a first generation layer arranged close to the light emission layer lying close to the anode and a second generation layer arranged close to the light emission layer lying close to the cathode, and in which the first generation layer is set at a lower electron affinity compared to that of the second generation layer, and that the second generation layer is set at a higher ionization potential compared to that of the first generation layer. Since the efficiencies of hole and electron injections to each light emission layer increase, an increase of the light quantity emitted by these light emission layers results.

<p id="p-0076" num="0074">In the opposite side of the transfer part <b>15</b>, a paper-feeding part <b>24</b> which stocks paper sheets P is provided. And paper sheets Pare taken out one by one from the paper-feeding part <b>24</b> by means of a paper-feeding roller <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0075">On the paper transport path from the paper-feeding part <b>24</b> to the transfer part <b>15</b>, a pair of registration rollers <b>26</b> is provided which feeds a paper sheet P to the transfer part <b>15</b> at a pre-determined timing. Further, on the paper transport path along which the paper sheet P runs holding the color toner images transferred at the transfer part <b>15</b>, a fixing part <b>27</b> is formed. The fixing part <b>27</b> comprises a heating roller <b>27</b><i>a </i>and a pressure roller <b>27</b><i>b </i>in a pressed contact with the heating roller <b>27</b><i>a</i>. The color image transferred on the paper sheet P is fixed onto the paper sheet P by the pressure and heat generated during the nipping rotation with the rollers <b>27</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0076">In the image-forming apparatus of such configuration, first of all, an electrostatic latent image for the yellow color component of image information is formed on the photoreceptor drum <b>10</b><i>a</i>. This latent image is visualized into a yellow toner image on the photoreceptor drum <b>10</b><i>a </i>by means of the development roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>having the yellow toner. Meanwhile, the paper sheet P pulled out of the paper-feeding part <b>24</b> by means of the paper-feeding roller <b>25</b> is fed into the transfer part <b>15</b> in exact timing. Then, the sheet is nipped and conveyed by the photoreceptor drum <b>10</b><i>a </i>in conjunction with the transfer roller <b>16</b>, and at this instant the above-described yellow toner image is transferred from the photoreceptor drum <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0077">During the transfer of the yellow toner image onto the paper sheet P, a latent image for the magenta color component is consequently formed, and is developed visible as a magenta toner image by means of the development roller <b>3</b><i>a </i>having the magenta toner. Then, on the paper sheet P onto which the yellow toner image has been transferred, the magenta toner image is transferred in superposed manner on the yellow toner image.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0078">Further, in a similar way, image formation and transfer are conducted for cyan toner and black toner images, and superimposition of the four-color toner images completes on the paper sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0079">Thereafter, the paper sheet P on which a color image has been formed is transported to the fixing part <b>27</b>. In the fixing part <b>27</b>, the transferred toner images are fixed onto the paper sheet P by heat, and a full-color image completes on the paper sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0080">The paper sheet P, on which the series of color image-forming operations have thus finished, is then exhausted to a paper-exhausting tray <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0081">The organic electroluminescence elements <b>6</b><i>d</i>, <b>7</b><i>d</i>, <b>8</b><i>d </i>and <b>9</b><i>d </i>which are the light sources equipped in the exposure parts <b>6</b> to <b>9</b> each comprise, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an anode <b>32</b> which comprises a transparent electro-conductive film formed on a substrate <b>31</b> by, for example, sputtering or resistive heating vapor deposition and acts as a hole injection electrode, and a cathode <b>33</b> which has been formed by, for example, resistive heating vapor deposition and acts as an electron injection electrode. Moreover, between the anode <b>32</b> and the cathode <b>33</b>, there are formed a first light emission layer <b>34</b> having a light emission region and arranged at the side of the anode <b>32</b>, and a second light emission layer <b>35</b> having a light emission region and arranged at the side of the cathode <b>33</b>. Between the anode <b>32</b> and the first light emission layer <b>34</b>, a first hole transport layer <b>36</b> is formed, and between the charge generation layer <b>38</b> and the second light emission layer <b>35</b>, a second hole transport layer <b>37</b> is formed. In addition, between the first light emission layer <b>34</b> and the second light emission layer <b>35</b>, a charge generation layer <b>38</b> which injects electrons into the first light emission layer <b>34</b> and injects holes into the second light emission layer <b>35</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0082">When a dc voltage or dc current is applied by making the anode <b>32</b> of the organic electroluminescence element of such configuration a positive electrode, and making the cathode <b>33</b> a negative electrode, holes are injected into the first light emission layer <b>34</b> via the first hole transport layer <b>36</b> from the anode <b>32</b> along with electron injection from the charge generation layer <b>38</b>. Into the second light emission layer <b>35</b>, electrons are injected from the cathode <b>33</b>, and at the same time holes are injected from the charge generation layer <b>38</b> via the second hole transport layer <b>37</b>. In the first light emission layer <b>34</b> and the second light emission layer <b>35</b>, the holes and electrons injected in this manner recombine, and excitons generated by such recombination cause light emission when the excitons shift from the excited state to the ground state.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0083">Here, since light emission takes place in plural light emission layers, i.e., the first one <b>34</b> and the second one <b>35</b>, the light quantity emitted from the organic electroluminescence element can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0084">In the organic electroluminescence element of such configuration, the light emitted from the luminescent material constituting the light emission regions of the first and second light emission layers <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> radiates in all directions with the center of the luminescent material, and emerges through the substrate <b>31</b>. Alternatively, once after emitted towards the direction opposite to the light-emerging direction (direction toward the substrate <b>31</b>) and reflected by the cathode <b>33</b>, then the light is irradiated through the substrate <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0085">As a next step, each part composing the organic electroluminescence element will be described.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0095">As the cathode <b>33</b> for the organic electroluminescence element, metals or alloys with a low work function are used including metals such as Al, In, Mg and Ti, magnesium alloys such as Mg&#x2014;Ag alloys and Mg&#x2014;In alloys, aluminum alloys such as Al&#x2014;Li alloys, Al&#x2014;Sr alloys and Al&#x2014;Ba alloys.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0096">If these organic thin film layers constituted by the light emission layer or the hole transport layer provided on the light emission layer if necessary, or the electron transport layer provided on the light emission layer if necessary are formed by a polymer material, a damage can be relieved in the film formation when another material is to be provided on the organic thin film layers. Also in the case in which a sputtering method or a resistance heating evaporation method is used for a method of laminating another material on the organic thin film layer, the damage caused by the film formation can be more lessened as compared with the case in which the organic thin film layer is constituted by a depolymerized material if the organic thin film layer is constituted by the polymer material. Also in the case in which a plurality of organic thin film layers is provided, furthermore, it is possible to select a film forming method which less damages a lower layer if the organic thin film layers to be provided are constituted by the polymer materials.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0097">Moreover, a film can be formed by a material in a small amount and a film thickness can be uniform in a large area for the film formation. Consequently, it is possible to fabricate an organic electroluminescence element having a large area. Moreover, a stability for the heat of the light emitting layer can be enhanced and the generation of a defect and a pinhole on an interface between the layers can be suppressed. Therefore, it is possible to form an organic electro luminescence unit having a high stability.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0098">If these organic thin film layers are constituted by polymer materials, particularly, a damage on the charge generation layer to be provided thereon can be relieved in the film formation. Therefore, it is possible to form the charge generation layer by using an optional process on a layer provided in contact with the charge generation layer on the substrate side, that is, the organic thin film layer to be a lower layer in the formation of the charge generation layer. Accordingly, the selectivity of the process for forming the charge generation layer can be increased so that the film can be formed by a simple process. Furthermore, the process for forming the charge generation layer is not limited. Consequently, the material of the charge generation layer can be properly selected from various materials and the selectivity of the material itself of the charge generation layer can be increased. In order to further relieve the damage on the organic thin film layer to be the lower layer in the film formation, it is preferable that the charge generation layer should be constituted by the polymer material. Thus, it is possible to select a film forming method causing a smaller damage on the lower layer as compared with the sputtering method.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0099">In the case in which these organic thin film layers (the light emitting layer or the hole transport layer or electron transport layer formed if necessary) are to be formed by polymer materials, it is also possible to use a wet film forming method such as a spin coating method, a casting method, a dipping method, a bar code method or a roll coating method. Consequently, a large-scaled vacuum device is not required. Thus, the film formation can be carried out by inexpensive equipment, and furthermore, an organic electroluminescence element having a large area can be fabricated easily. In addition, an adhesion between the layers of the organic electroluminescence element can be enhanced. Therefore, a short circuit in the unit can be suppressed and the organic electroluminescence element having a high stability can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0100">It is desirable that a heating and drying temperature for forming a light receiving region should not exceed the glass transition temperature of any polymeric organic matter used in the formed layers in order not to damage the layers formed in advance. In particular, it is desirable that the drying temperature of the light emission layer on the closer side to a cathode (or the hole transport layer or the electron transport layer which is formed if necessary) should not exceed the glass transition temperature of the light emission layer on the closer side to an anode (or the hole transport layer or the electron transport layer which is formed if necessary). In this case, it is possible to form the light emission layer on the closer side to the cathode without damaging the light emission layer on the closer side to the anode. Consequently, it is possible to easily form an organic electroluminescence element having a multilayer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0101">As the charge generation layer <b>38</b> of the organic electroluminescence element, materials that are transparent to the light emitted from the light emission layer, and capable of efficiently injecting hole-electron pairs, including, for example, metal oxides such as ITO (indium-tin oxide) and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>(vanadium oxide), and organic materials such as 4F-TCNQ (tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane) may also be used. Particularly when the light emission layer is made of a high polymer organic film, a high polymer organic material should preferably used for the charge generation layer is preferably made of whereby damages during film formation can be mitigated. At the same time, since the charge generation layer and the light emission layer can be fabricated in the form of film by similar methods, an organic electroluminescence element comprising multiple layers stacked on each other can be produced by a simplified process.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0102">In addition to the above-cited materials, various materials such as conductors, semi-conductors, dielectrics and insulators, or stacked films obtained by laminating plural materials can also be used for the charge generation layer <b>38</b>.</p>

Accordingly, in cases where the charge generation layer <b>38</b> mentioned above or to be described hereinafter is made of a &#x201c;wide gap semiconductor&#x201d;, the layer is expressed as a buffer layer.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0105">In an organic electroluminescence element having a structure described heretofore, when the charge generation layer <b>38</b> is made of a conductor, the work function of the charge generation layer <b>38</b> is set higher than the ionization potential of the second light emission layer <b>35</b>. Alternatively, when the charge generation layer <b>38</b> is made of a semiconductor, dielectric or insulator, it is desirable to configure the electron affinity of the charge generation layer <b>38</b> to be lower than the electron affinity of the first light emission layer <b>34</b>, and the ionization potential of the charge generation layer <b>38</b> to be higher than the ionization potential of the second light emission layer <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0106">Such configuration is due to the following mechanism. When the electron affinity of the charge generation layer <b>38</b> is lower than that of the first light emission layer <b>34</b>, the efficiency of electron injection from the charge generation layer <b>38</b> to the first light emission layer <b>34</b> is enhanced, and when the work function of the charge generation layer <b>38</b> is higher than the ionization potential of the second light emission layer <b>35</b>, or when the ionization potential of the charge generation layer <b>38</b> is higher than the ionization potential of the second light emission layer <b>35</b>, the efficiency of hole injection from the charge generation layer <b>38</b> to the second light emission layer <b>35</b> is enhanced. Accordingly, the quantities of light emitted from the first light emission layer <b>34</b> and the second one <b>35</b> increase, resulting in a further increase of the emitted light quantity of the organic electroluminescence element.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0107">By way of precaution, in the case where the charge generation layer <b>38</b> is made of an inorganic material, it is ordinary that the ionization potential of the second light emission layer <b>35</b> is higher than that of the charge generation layer <b>38</b>.

<p id="p-0110" num="0108">The ionized potential indicates an energy required for completely taking one electron from a neutral atom or molecule to the outside, the work function indicates an energy required for completely taking an electron from a metal or the crystal surface of a semiconductor to the outside, and the electron affinity indicates an energy to be discharged for adding one electron to a neutral atom or molecule and is generally represented by a difference from a vacuum level. The magnitude of the energy in the invention implies the absolute value of an energy value, and a high work function indicates that the absolute value of the energy value of the work function is great.</p>

Moreover, in cases where the element configuration uses high polymer material, the light emission layer or charge generation layer is preferably fabricated by a wet film-forming process for the purpose of reducing material loss during element production. And, the drying temperature for an organic layer arranged close to the cathode in such wet process film formation preferably should not exceed the glass transition temperature of the organic film arranged closer to the anode than the layer to be dried.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the essential part of an organic electroluminescence element used as the light source of the exposure part for the color image-forming apparatus in the third embodiment for practicing the invention. For confirmation, in the present embodiment, the configuration and the details of the color image-forming apparatus are the same as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> used in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0126">The depicted organic electroluminescence element as the exposure light source has a structure comprising, provided on a substrate <b>31</b>, an anode <b>32</b>, a first hole transport layer <b>36</b>, a first light emission layer <b>34</b>, a cathode <b>33</b>, an insulating layer <b>39</b>, an anode <b>32</b>, a second hole transport layer <b>37</b>, a second light emission layer <b>35</b> and another cathode <b>33</b>, all stacked in turn. In other words, in the structure, the anodes <b>32</b> and the cathodes <b>33</b> are arranged alternately each with the intervening light emission layer <b>34</b> (<b>35</b>) and hole transport layer <b>36</b> (<b>37</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0127">By way of precaution, all the anodes and cathodes need not always sandwich the light emission layer or other ones, but, as is exemplified by the spatial relation of the anode <b>32</b> to the cathode <b>33</b> both being inter-layers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, may sandwich an insulating layer <b>39</b>, i.e., a layer other than a light emission layer.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0128">When a dc voltage or dc current is applied by making the anode <b>32</b> of the organic electroluminescence element of such configuration a positive electrode, and making the cathode <b>33</b> thereof a negative electrode, holes are injected into the first light emission layer <b>34</b> via the first hole transport layer <b>36</b> from the anode <b>32</b> at the substrate (<b>31</b>) side along with electron injection from the cathode <b>33</b> lying at the insulating layer (<b>39</b>) side; and into the second light emission layer <b>35</b>, electrons are injected from the uppermost cathode <b>33</b>, and at the same time holes are injected from the anode <b>32</b> lying at the insulating layer (<b>39</b>) side via the second hole transport layer <b>37</b>. In the first light emission layer <b>34</b> and the second light emission layer <b>35</b>, the holes and electrons injected in this manner recombine, and excitons generated by such recombination cause light emission when the excitons shift from the excited state to the ground state.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0129">Accordingly, the light quantity emitted by the organic electroluminescence element can be increased also with the configuration described above, since light emission takes place in plural light emission layers, i.e., the first and second light emission layers (<b>34</b> and <b>35</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0130">To make sure, the insulating layer <b>39</b> may be omitted in some cases. Also in the present embodiment, each of the organic thin film layers assumes a double-layer structure consisting of a hole transport layer <b>36</b> (<b>37</b>) and a light emission layer <b>34</b> (<b>35</b>). In addition to such configuration, a monolayer structure consisting of a light emission layer, a double-layer structure consisting of a light emission layer and an electron transport layer, and a tri-layer structure consisting of a hole transport layer, a light emission layer and an electron transport layer may also be adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0131">Moreover, in the case shown in the figure, the two anodes <b>32</b> and two cathodes <b>33</b> are alternately arranged, but it is sufficient that at least one anode and one cathode are arranged alternately.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0132">In the present embodiment, the light emission layers and hole transport layers arranged between the first fabricated electrode and the subsequently fabricated one are preferably formulated with high polymer material which is less subject to damaging. In a monolayer structure consisting of a light emission layer, a double-layer structure consisting of a light emission layer and an electron transport layer, and a tri-layer structure consisting of a hole transport layer, a light emission layer and an electron transport layer, any layer of these is preferably made of high polymer material.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0133">In the description hereinabove, the organic electroluminescence element as the exposure light source is driven by dc; however, it may be driven by ac voltage or ac current, or further by wave pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0134">Though the exposure light emitted from the organic electroluminescence element emerges from the substrate (<b>31</b>) side, other designs are possible in which the light emerges from the opposite side relative to the substrate <b>31</b> (i.e., from the cathode side) or in which the light emerges sideways.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0135">Though the above explanation has been made for the case where the invention is applied to a color image-forming apparatus, the invention can be applied to a monochromatic (for example, black) image-forming apparatus.

<p id="p-0144" num="0142">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, at the positions facing these exposure parts <b>106</b> to <b>109</b>, the photoreception parts <b>110</b> to <b>113</b> and the development parts <b>102</b> to <b>105</b>, a transfer part <b>115</b> is arranged at which each toner image developed on one of the photoreceptor drums <b>110</b><i>a </i>to <b>113</b><i>a </i>is transferred onto a paper sheet (recording medium) P in superposition on each other to give a color toner image.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0143">Each transfer part <b>115</b> is provided with a transfer roller <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>, <b>118</b> or <b>119</b> arranged to face each of the photoreceptor drums <b>110</b><i>a </i>to <b>113</b><i>a</i>, and spring <b>120</b>, <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> or <b>123</b> each of which presses each of the transfer rollers <b>116</b> to <b>119</b> onto each of the photoreceptor drums <b>110</b><i>a </i>to <b>113</b><i>a </i></p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0144">In the opposite side of the transfer part <b>115</b>, a paper-feeding part <b>124</b> which stocks paper sheets P is provided. And paper sheets P are taken out one by one from the paper-feeding part <b>124</b> by means of a paper-feeding roller <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0145">On the paper transport path from the paper-feeding part <b>124</b> to the transfer part <b>115</b>, a pair of registration rollers <b>126</b> is provided which feeds a paper sheet P to the transfer part <b>115</b> at a pre-determined timing. Further, on the paper transport path along which the paper sheet P runs holding the color toner images transferred at the transfer part <b>115</b>, a fixing part <b>127</b> is formed. The fixing part <b>127</b> comprises a heating roller <b>127</b><i>a </i>and a pressure roller <b>127</b><i>b </i>in a pressed contact with the heating roller <b>127</b><i>a</i>. The color image transferred on the paper sheet P is fixed onto the paper sheet P by the pressure and heat generated during the nipping rotation with the rollers <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0146">In the image-forming apparatus of such configuration, first of all, an electrostatic latent image for the yellow color component of image information is formed on the photoreceptor drum <b>110</b><i>a</i>. This latent image is visualized into a yellow toner image on the photoreceptor drum <b>110</b><i>a </i>by means of the development roller <b>102</b><i>a </i>having the yellow toner. Meanwhile, the paper sheet P pulled out of the paper-feeding part <b>124</b> by means of the paper-feeding roller <b>125</b> is fed into the transfer part <b>115</b> in exact timing. Then, the sheet is nipped and conveyed by the photoreceptor drum <b>110</b><i>a </i>in conjunction with the transfer roller <b>116</b>, and at this instant the above-described yellow toner image is transferred from the photoreceptor drum <b>110</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0147">During the transfer of the yellow toner image onto the paper sheet P, a latent image for the magenta color component is consequently formed, and is developed visible as a magenta toner image by means of the development roller <b>103</b><i>a </i>having the magenta toner. Then, on the paper sheet P onto which the yellow toner image has been transferred, the magenta toner image is transferred in superposed manner on the yellow toner image.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0148">Further, in a similar way, image formation and transfer are conducted for cyan toner and black toner images, and superimposition of the four-color toner images completes on the paper sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0149">Thereafter, the paper sheet P on which a color image has been formed is transported to the fixing part <b>127</b>.

<p id="p-0155" num="0153">When a current is applied to the organic electroluminescence element <b>106</b><i>b </i>to <b>109</b><i>b </i>having the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> by making the anode <b>130</b> a positive electrode and the cathode <b>131</b> a negative electrode, holes are injected into the light-emitting layer <b>132</b> from the anode <b>130</b> via the hole transport layer <b>133</b>, and electrons are injected from the cathode <b>131</b> via the electron transport layer <b>134</b>. In the light-emitting layer <b>132</b>, the recombination of the hole and electron thus injected takes place, and the phenomenon of light emission takes place with the shift of an exciton generated by such recombination from the excited state to the ground state.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0154">In an organic electroluminescence element of such structure, the light emitted from the luminescent material that is the light-emitting region in the light-emitting layer <b>132</b> radiates omni-directionally with the center of the luminescent material, and emerges through the waveguide <b>129</b>. Alternatively, the light once proceeds in the direction opposite to the light emerging direction (the direction toward the waveguide <b>129</b>), is reflected at the cathode <b>131</b>, and emerges through the waveguide <b>129</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0155">In an organic electroluminescence element such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the light-emitting layer <b>132</b> of the element is preferably configured thicker than the anode <b>130</b> or the cathode <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0156">Generally speaking, a short circuit occasionally occurs in an organic electroluminescence element due to a foreign matter present in the light-emitting layer <b>132</b>. Alternatively, due to the level difference formed by the end of the anode <b>130</b> or cathode <b>131</b>, the thickness of the light-emitting layer <b>132</b> becomes smaller than the pre-determined value. Thus, a short circuit sometimes occurs at the edge of the anode <b>130</b> or cathode <b>131</b>. However, by configuring the element in the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, one can achieve an exposure unit that is less subject to short circuit between the anode <b>130</b> and cathode <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0157">Next, individual parts and members composing the organic electroluminescence elements <b>106</b><i>d </i>to <b>109</b><i>d </i>will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0158">The waveguide <b>129</b> of the organic electroluminescence elements <b>106</b><i>d </i>to <b>109</b><i>d </i>in accordance with the invention comprises a transparent core <b>129</b><i>a </i>and a clad which has a refractive index smaller than that of core <b>129</b><i>a </i>and lies around core <b>129</b><i>a </i>(See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.). But, since clad <b>129</b><i>b </i>can be substituted by an air layer, the waveguide may comprise only core <b>129</b><i>a</i>. By way of precaution, the definition of transparency or semi-transparency in the invention indicates such a degree of transparency as not to disturb the visual perception of the light emission by the organic electroluminescence element.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0159">The material used for the waveguide can be appropriately chosen from inorganic glass including inorganic oxide glass such as, for example, transparent or semi-transparent soda-lime glass, barium and/or strontium-containing glass, lead glass, aluminosilicate glass, borosilicate glass, barium borosilicate glass and quartz glass, inorganic fluoride glass, high polymer glass such as transparent or semi-transparent poly(ethylene terephthalate), polycarbonate, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(ether sulfone), poly(vinyl fluoride), polypropylene, polyethylene, acrylate polymer, amorphous polyolefin and fluorine-containing resin, chalcogenide glass such as transparent or semi-transparent As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, As<sub>40</sub>S<sub>10 </sub>and S<sub>40</sub>Ge<sub>10</sub>, metal oxide and nitride such as ZnO, Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, SiO, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, HfO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>, or else pigment-containing transparent substrate materials enumerated above. In addition, laminated substrates resulting from stacking a plurality of substrate materials may also be used. Further, a resist film can be used after bleaching. Still further, to make the refractive index of the waveguide close to that of the light-emitting layer, the waveguide can be composed of the same material as that of the light-emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0160">A light angle conversion structure is such that, when incident light reaches the boundary between two different media, the light is reflected at an angle different from the angle incident on the boundary, and comprises planes not parallel to any plane composing the substrate and a structure comprising such planes.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0161">Specifically, the plane neither parallel nor vertical to the boundary is mentioned, and structures comprising such planes are exemplified by a triangular prism, a cylinder, a triangular pyramid and a cone, or composites or scattering planes in which these figures are arranged three- or two-dimensionally, also by a waveguide curvature, concavities and convexities in a waveguide surface, a micro lens, a micro prism and a micro mirror structure, and the assemblages of these.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0162">For confirmation, the light angle conversion structure may be provided on the surface or inside of a waveguide.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0163">In the case where a light angle conversion structure is provided on the waveguide surface, concavities and convexities can be formed on the waveguide surface by grinding the waveguide surface, and on the concavities and convexities, a clad or light-emitting element can be formed. An angle conversion structure can also be achieved by bonding micro lenses on the waveguide surface. In the case where a light angle conversion structure is provided on the waveguide surface, the boundary surface may be the air/substrate interface whereby the air is used as a clad layer. In this way, by processing the waveguide surface after the fabrication of an organic electroluminescence element, a light angle conversion structure can be formed. Thus, due to the simplicity of the production procedure, the structure can be formed rather easily.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0164">In the case where a light angle conversion structure is provided inside of the waveguide, concavities and convexities or micro lenses are involved in the waveguide. Thus, the structure can be formed in the core or clad, or at the core/clad interface. When the structure is formed at the core/clad interface, concavities and convexities are formed on the core surface by grinding, blasting or etching, and then a clad layer is formed on the processed surface, thus achieving a angle conversion structure. Since the light angle conversion structure is not naked in such configuration, light angle conversion is stably conducted. Further, since the waveguide surface can be made flat, an anode and the like can be fabricated on the waveguide surface with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0165">Still further, depending on the application, such materials as to transmit light only in a specified wavelength region or have a light-to-light conversion capability and convert impinging light to the one with a specified wavelength may be used. Alternatively, the waveguide may include a plurality of waveguide paths optically isolated from each other are arranged for each pixel in parallelism to each other in the main scanning direction. Moreover, by configuring the core portion of the waveguide to be electrically conductive and the clad to be insulating, one can use a plurality of electrically separated core portions as anodes or cathodes.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0166">In the present embodiment, the waveguide <b>129</b> form waveguide paths optically isolated from each other and arranged for each pixel in parallelism to each other in the main scanning direction. The substrate <b>129</b> comprises a core <b>129</b><i>a </i>having a specified refractive index and a clad <b>129</b><i>b </i>formed around the external periphery of the core <b>129</b><i>a </i>and having a refractive index smaller than that of the core.

<p id="p-0169" num="0167">The refractive index of the core <b>129</b><i>a </i>can be set smaller than that of the light-emitting layer, or larger than the value obtained by subtracting 0.3 from the refractive index of the light-emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0168">In the present embodiment, the waveguide <b>129</b> consists of waveguide paths with a pitch of about 10.5 &#x3bc;m, and is configured so as to correspond to the resolution of 2400 dpi in the main scanning direction whereby an arbitrary cross-sectional shape is allowed so long as it can form a specified latent image on a photoreceptor. Hence, depending on the printing conditions such as resolution and the revolution of the photoreceptor, the pitch as well as the cross-sectional shape can be designed appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0169">Though the configuration in which the waveguide is used as the substrate was described in the present embodiment, another configuration in which the organic electroluminescence element and the waveguide are fabricated separately whereby the organic electroluminescence element and the waveguide are bonded with an optical adhesive. When an air layer lies between the organic electroluminescence element and the waveguide in such a configuration, the quantity of light propagating through the waveguide decreases due to total reflection, and an efficient light propagation is not achieved. Accordingly, it is desirable to bond the organic electroluminescence element and the waveguide in such a manner as to exclude an air layer therebetween, when the two components are fabricated separately.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0170">As the substrate for the organic electroluminescence element in accordance with the invention, a transparent or semi-transparent material may be used; in cases where light is taken out not through the substrate, an opaque material may also be used. Any of these materials can be used so long as it has a sufficient strength for holding the organic electroluminescence element. The substrate can be appropriately selected from the transparent substrate materials equivalent to the above-enumerated ones for the waveguide. Further, the substrate can be fabricated by appropriately selecting from semiconductors such as opaque silicon, germanium, silicon carbide, gallium arsenide and gallium nitride, pigment-containing transparent substrate materials mentioned above, metal material which surface has been subjected to insulation treatment, and plastic materials. In addition, laminated substrates resulting from stacking a plurality of substrate materials may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0171">As for the resistivity of the substrate, though the substrate is preferably an insulator, there is no specific restriction, and the substrate should have a resistivity in the range not to impede the driving of the organic electroluminescence element.

Further, a transparent electrode can be prepared by stacking a plurality of the above-mentioned materials for transparent electrode. Methods of fabrication include resistive heating vapor deposition, electron beam vapor deposition, sputtering and various polymerization methods such as electric field polymerization. In order to have a sufficient conductivity or prevent an uneven light emission caused by the unevenness of the substrate surface, the transparent electrode preferably has a thickness of 1 nm or more. And, to secure a sufficient transparency, the thickness preferably does not exceed 500 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0174">Moreover, as the anode, in addition to the materials for transparent electrode cited previously, metals having a large work function such as Cr (chromium), Ni (nickel), Cu (copper), Sn (tin), W (tungsten) and Au (gold), alloys and oxides of these metals can be used. Stacked structures comprising a plurality of the anode materials cited above can also be adopted. However, in the case of not using a transparent electrode for the anode, the anode is preferably fabricated with a material that reflects light to utilize the effect of the light angle conversion member at maximum. In the case of not using a transparent electrode for the anode, it suffices to make the cathode a transparent electrode.</p>

<p id="p-0181" num="0179">As the cathode <b>31</b> for the organic electroluminescence elements <b>106</b><i>d </i>to <b>109</b><i>d</i>, metals or alloys with a low work function are used including metals such as Al, In, Mg and Ti, magnesium alloys such as Mg&#x2014;Ag alloys and Mg&#x2014;In alloys, aluminum alloys such as Al&#x2014;Li alloys, Al&#x2014;Sr alloys and Al&#x2014;Ba alloys.

<p id="p-0182" num="0180">A transparent cathode can be fabricated by forming a ultra-thin film with high light transparency using a metal with a small work function, and then overlaying a transparent electrode on the film.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0181">For the fabrication of such cathode, resistive heat vapor deposition, electron beam vapor deposition and sputtering are adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0182">As has been stated previously, in the organic electroluminescence elements <b>106</b><i>d </i>to <b>109</b><i>d</i>, the light emitted from the light-emitting layer is radiated through the opposite surface of the waveguide. When the light reaches the boundary between each medium, if the refractive index of the medium lying in the incident side is larger than that of the medium lying in the emerging side, the light incident at an angle larger than the critical angle at which the emerging angle of the refracted wave becomes 90&#xb0; cannot pass the boundary but is to totally reflected at the boundary between the media.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0183">Accordingly, in the organic electroluminescence elements <b>106</b><i>d </i>to <b>109</b><i>d </i>in which light is emitted isotropically, the light emitted at an angle larger than this critical angle advances in the waveguide to the edge in the sub-scanning direction by repeating total reflection at the boundary plane of the waveguide; particularly in the configuration of the present embodiment, the light advances in the core <b>129</b><i>a </i>surrounded by the clad <b>129</b><i>b </i>of the waveguide <b>129</b> by repeating total reflection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0184">Thus, in the present embodiment, by taking notice of this fact, the edge plane of the waveguide <b>129</b> in the sub-scanning direction is configured as a light emerging plane <b>135</b>, and the light emerging from this light emerging plane <b>135</b> is used as the exposure light.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0185">In this structure, with the increase of the area of the light-emitting layer, the light quantity proceeding in the core <b>129</b><i>a </i>increases. Thus, the light quantity reaching the light emerging plane <b>135</b> that is the edge plane of the waveguide <b>129</b> in the sub-scanning direction increases. This means that, since the exposure light quantity increases only by increasing the area of the light-emitting layer in the case where the light from the light emerging plane <b>135</b>, which is the edge plane of the waveguide <b>129</b> in the sub-scanning direction, is used as the exposure light, the level of emitting light quantity required for image exposure is achieved without shortening the life of the organic electroluminescence element by increasing the applied current.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0186">In short, the invention uses the light from the light emerging plane <b>135</b> that is the edge plane of the waveguide <b>129</b>. In the present embodiment, the substrate and the waveguide are unified as mentioned above. However, the waveguide may be fabricated independent of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0187">With use of an image-forming apparatus equipped with such exposure unit, electrostatic latent images can be adequately formed on the photoreceptor drums <b>110</b><i>a </i>to <b>113</b><i>a</i>, leading to high quality image formation.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0188">In particular, because the waveguide <b>129</b> that acts to guide light comprises a core <b>129</b><i>a </i>and a clad <b>129</b><i>b </i>in the present embodiment, the light emitted from the light-emitting layer is efficiently conducted to the light emerging plane <b>135</b>, the emitted light quantity further increases. However, the structure of the waveguide is not restricted to the double-layer one of a core <b>129</b><i>a </i>and a clad <b>129</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0189">In the double-layer structure, between the adjacent cores <b>129</b><i>a</i>, a light-shielding layer or light reflection layer may be provided. By the provision of the light-shielding layer or light reflection layer, a core <b>129</b><i>a </i>in concern does not receive light from another core <b>129</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the fluctuation among cores <b>129</b><i>a </i>of the light quantity emergent from the light emerging plane <b>135</b> diminishes. Particularly when a reflection layer is provided, a larger quantity of light reaches the light emerging plane <b>135</b> owing to an enhanced reflection of the light impinging in the core <b>129</b><i>a </i>from the light-emitting layer, leading to an increase of light quantity.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0190">Though the light emerging plane <b>135</b> can be fabricated so as to have a rectangular or hexagonal shape, it is preferred to fabricate it into the shape corresponding to that of the pixel. By way of precaution, when the waveguide <b>129</b> comprises a core <b>129</b><i>a </i>and a clad <b>129</b><i>b</i>, light emerging plane <b>135</b> is a plane composed of the core <b>129</b><i>a </i>and the clad <b>129</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0191">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, in the waveguide an angle conversion part <b>136</b> can be provided which converts the angle of light impinging on the waveguide <b>129</b> from the light-emitting layer <b>132</b> to direct light to the light emerging plane <b>135</b>. By providing such an angle conversion part <b>136</b>, the quantity of light emerging from the light emerging plane <b>135</b> can be further enhanced. In the case depicted in the figure, angle conversion part <b>136</b> is a light-scattering surface which comprises a large number of semi-spherical bodies arranged in the plane of the waveguide <b>129</b> opposite to the light-emitting layer <b>132</b>. Instead of this light-scattering surface, a concavo-convex surface, a hog-backed or saw-tooth concavo-convex surface uniformly extending in the main scanning direction, or still other ones with various surface shapes may also be adopted. Then, by providing an angle conversion part <b>136</b> that consists of a one-dimensional profile aligned in parallel in a large number, angle conversion for a specified angle can be achieved. To make sure, it is desirable that the angle conversion part <b>36</b> does not accompany any angle conversion toward the main scanning direction for the purpose of conducting the light directed in the directions other than the sub-scanning direction to the light emerging plane <b>135</b>. In particular, it is effective to provide an angle conversion part <b>136</b> that performs angle conversion for the direction (one normal to the light-emitting layer plane) perpendicular to both of the main and sub-scanning directions, since the light that would be lost if such angle conversion part is not provided is conducted to the light emerging plane <b>135</b> without disturbing the propagation of light in the sub-scanning direction. Additionally, in the case where the waveguide <b>129</b> comprises a core <b>129</b><i>a </i>and a clad <b>129</b><i>b</i>, angle conversion by the angle conversion part <b>136</b> is achieved along with an effective use of the total reflection effect at the interface between the core <b>129</b><i>a </i>and the clad <b>129</b><i>b </i>by forming the angle conversion part <b>136</b> at the interface between the core <b>129</b><i>a </i>and the clad <b>129</b><i>b </i>lying opposite to the light-emitting layer <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0192">Further, in waveguide <b>129</b>, a reflection layer can be provided in the planes facing the light emerging plane <b>135</b> and lying opposite to the light-emitting layer <b>132</b>. Since, by the provision of a reflection layer, a larger portion of the light impinging on the waveguide <b>129</b> from the light-emitting layer <b>132</b> is reflected and reaches the light emerging plane <b>135</b>, an increase of light quantity can be achieved. For confirmation, the reflection layer may be provided only either the plane facing the light emerging plane <b>135</b> or the one lying opposite to the light-emitting layer <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0193">Still further, in the light emerging plane <b>135</b> of the waveguide <b>129</b>, a diffusion-suppressing member <b>137</b> can be provided that makes the diffusion angle of the light emerging from the light emerging plane <b>135</b> narrow or parallel. As the diffusion-suppressing member <b>137</b> to be provided, in addition to curved surface lenses such as concave and convex lenses, a ion-doped type lens, a slit-shaped UV-converted lens, a mesa structure utilizing total reflection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, and a tapered reflection structure in which a mirror plane is arranged at the position equivalent to the total reflection plane of the mesa structure are mentioned. A lens may be allotted to each light emerging plane <b>135</b>, or plural lenses may be provided per one light emerging plane <b>135</b>. Alternatively, one lens may be allotted to plural light emerging planes <b>135</b>, or a cylindrical lens or one-dimensional mesa structure may be provided for all of the light emerging planes. All of these structures based on unified lens(es) can suppress light diffusion.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0194">In the case where the light emerging plane <b>135</b> of the waveguide <b>129</b> is arranged at a position very close to each of the photoreceptor drums <b>110</b><i>a </i>to <b>113</b><i>a</i>, specifically within a distance not exceeding the diagonal length of a pixel, the light emerging from the light emerging plane <b>135</b> is directly irradiated on the photoreceptor drum not through one of image transmission optics <b>106</b><i>f </i>to <b>109</b><i>f</i>. In the case where the light emerging plane <b>135</b> is arranged at a position apart from each of the photoreceptor drums <b>110</b><i>a </i>to <b>113</b><i>a</i>, the light is focused on the drum (<b>110</b><i>a </i>to <b>113</b><i>a</i>) as an erect, actual size image.</p>

<p id="p-0202" num="0200">When an electric current is applied to the organic electroluminescence elements having the configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> by making the anode <b>130</b> a positive electrode and the cathode <b>131</b> a negative electrode, the first light-emitting layer <b>138</b> is injected holes from the anode <b>130</b> via the first hole transport layer <b>141</b> along with electron injection from the charge generation layer <b>140</b> via the first electron transport layer <b>142</b>, and the second light-emitting layer <b>139</b> is injected electrons from the cathode <b>131</b> via the second electron transport layer <b>144</b> along with hole injection from the charge generation layer <b>140</b> via the second hole transport layer <b>143</b>. In the first and second light-emitting layers <b>138</b> and <b>139</b>, recombination of the hole and electron thus injected takes place; and when an exciton generated by such recombination shifts from the excited state to the ground state, the phenomenon of light emission takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0201">Since light emission takes place in the plural light-emitting layers of the first one <b>138</b> and the second one <b>139</b>, the light quantity emitted from the organic electroluminescence element can be increased.</p>

In addition to those, various materials such as conductor, semiconductor, dielectric and insulator, and a stacked film resulting from stacking plural materials can be used for the charge generation layer <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0203">In an organic electroluminescence element having a structure described heretofore, the work function of the charge generation layer <b>140</b> is set higher than the ionization potential of the first light-emitting layer <b>138</b> close to the anode <b>130</b>.

<p id="p-0206" num="0204">Such setting is due to the following mechanism.

Accordingly, the quantity of light emitted from the first light-emitting layer <b>138</b> lying close to the anode <b>130</b> and the second light-emitting layer <b>139</b> lying close to the cathode <b>131</b> increases, resulting in a further increase of the emitted light quantity of the organic electroluminescence element.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0205">By way of precaution, in the case where the charge generation layer <b>140</b> is made of an inorganic material, it is ordinary that the ionization potential of the second light-emitting layer <b>139</b> is higher than that of the charge generation layer <b>140</b>. Under such condition, the efficiency of hole injection from the charge generation layer <b>140</b> to the second light-emitting layer <b>139</b> can be made high without deterioration by making the potential difference between the two layers as small as possible, specifically, for example, 0.6 eV or smaller, even if the ionization potential of the charge generation layer is lower than that of the second light-emitting layer. In addition, the efficiency of hole and electron injections to each light emission layer can increase, for example, by making the potential difference between the electron affinity of the first light-emitting layer <b>138</b> close to the anode <b>130</b> and the electron affinity of the charge generation layer <b>140</b>, such that the potential difference between the ionization potential of the second light emitting-layer <b>139</b> close to the cathode <b>131</b> and the ionization potential of the charge generation layer <b>140</b>, are both configured to be 0.6 eV or less.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0206">And, by adopting such an organic electroluminescence element as the light source for an exposure part, it is possible to attain the level of light quantity required for image exposure without making the apparatus bulky.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0207">Moreover, by using such an exposure part in an image-forming apparatus, a compact image-forming apparatus can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0208">By way of precaution, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the charge generation layer <b>140</b> can take a double-layer structure comprising the first charge generation layer <b>140</b><i>a </i>arranged close to the first light-emitting layer <b>134</b> which lies close to the anode, and a second generation layer <b>140</b><i>b </i>arranged close to the second light-emitting layer <b>139</b> which lies close to the cathode, or a multi-layer structure comprising still more layers.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0209">In such multi-layer structures, it is preferred to set the electron affinity of the first generation layer <b>140</b><i>a </i>lower than that of the second charge generation layer <b>140</b><i>b</i>, and the ionization potential of the second charge generation layer <b>140</b><i>b </i>higher than that of the first charge generation layer <b>140</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0210">Further, the layer which is first fabricated into the form of film (either the first charge generation layer <b>140</b><i>a </i>or the second one <b>140</b><i>b</i>) is preferably produced by resistive heating, in order to reduce the damaging of the first light-emitting layer <b>138</b> during the film-forming step for forming, for example, the first charge generation layer <b>40</b><i>a </i>on the first light-emitting layer <b>138</b> lying close to the anode. The charge generation layer to be provided thereafter can be fabricated even by sputtering, plasma CVD, ion beam or electron beam deposition all of which may cause damaging during film formation.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0211">In the case where a dielectric material is used for the charge generation layer <b>140</b>, it is preferred to set the relative permittivity of the charge generation layer <b>140</b> larger than those of the first light-emitting layer <b>138</b> lying close to the anode and of the second light-emitting layer <b>139</b> lying close to the cathode. For example, it is preferred that the relative permittivity of the charge generation layer <b>138</b> is set at roughly 8 to 10 or higher while the relative permittivity of the first light-emitting layer <b>138</b> lying close to the anode and that of the second light-emitting layer <b>139</b> lying close to the cathode are set at about 3.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0212">Among the light-emitting layers, the hole transport layers and the electron transport layers arranged between the first fabricated electrode (either the anode <b>130</b> or the cathode <b>131</b>) and the charge generation layer <b>140</b> (i.e., the first light-emitting layer <b>138</b>, the first hole transport layer <b>141</b> and the first electron transport layer <b>142</b> when the anode <b>130</b> is first fabricated; and the second light-emitting layer <b>139</b> lying close to the cathode, the second hole transport layer <b>143</b> and the second electron transport layer <b>144</b> when the cathode <b>134</b> is first fabricated), the one adjacent to charge generation layer <b>140</b>, in other words, the one adjacent to the charge generation layer <b>140</b> among the layers including the light-emitting ones, should preferably be made of a high polymer material since it is less subject to damaging during the formation of the charge generation layer <b>140</b>. In the cases of a monolayer structure consisting of a light-emitting layer, a double-layer structure consisting of a light-emitting layer and an electron transport layer, a double-layer structure consisting of a hole transport layer and a light-emitting layer, or a multi-layer structure consisting of various functional layers such as hole transport, hole injection, electron blocking, and electron injection layers, the layer adjacent to the charge generation layer <b>140</b> among these layers is made of a high polymer material.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0213">By way of precaution, the first light-emitting layer <b>138</b> lying close to the anode and the second light-emitting layer <b>139</b> lying close to the cathode may be formulated with the same material or different ones.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0214">In the description hereinabove, the organic electroluminescence element as the exposure light source is driven by dc; however, it may be driven by ac voltage or ac current, or further by wave pulse, too.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0215">Though the above explanation has been made for the case where the invention is applied to a color image-forming apparatus, the invention can be applied to a monochromatic, for example, black image-forming apparatus. In cases where the invention is applied to a color image-forming apparatus, the developing colors are not restricted to the four colors of yellow, magenta, cyan and black.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(Sixth Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0216"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing the essential part of an organic electroluminescence element used as the exposure light source for the color image-forming apparatus in the sixth embodiment for practicing the invention. For confirmation, in the present embodiment, the configuration and the details of the color image-forming apparatus are the same as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 13</figref> used in the fourth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0217">The organic electroluminescence element as the light source for exposure shown in the figure consists of an anode <b>130</b>, a first hole transport layer <b>145</b>, a first light-emitting layer <b>146</b>, a first electron transport layer <b>147</b>, a cathode <b>131</b>, an insulating layer <b>148</b>, another anode <b>130</b>, a second hole transport layer <b>149</b>, a second light-emitting layer <b>105</b>, a second electron transport layer <b>151</b> and a cathode <b>131</b> stacked in turn on a waveguide <b>129</b>. In other words, the element has the configuration of alternately arranged anodes <b>130</b> and cathodes <b>131</b> with an intervening light-emitting layer <b>146</b> (<b>150</b>), a hole transport layer <b>145</b> (<b>149</b>) and an electron transport layer <b>147</b> (<b>151</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0218">By way of precaution, all the anodes and cathodes need not sandwich a light-emitting layer, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> of the second embodiment, but, as is exemplified by the relation of the anode <b>130</b> to the cathode <b>131</b> both as intermediate layers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> of the third embodiment, may sandwich a layer other than a light-emitting layer such as insulating layer <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0219">When a dc voltage or dc current is applied to the organic electroluminescence elements of such configuration by making the two anodes <b>130</b> positive electrodes and the two cathodes <b>131</b> negative electrodes, the first light-emitting layer <b>146</b> is injected holes from the anode <b>130</b> lying close to the waveguide <b>129</b> via the first hole transport layer <b>146</b> along with electron injection from the cathode <b>131</b> lying close to the insulating layer <b>148</b> via the first electron transport layer <b>147</b>, and the second light-emitting layer <b>150</b> is injected electrons from the top cathode <b>131</b> via the second electron transport layer <b>151</b> along with hole injection from the anode <b>130</b> lying close to the insulating layer <b>148</b> via the second hole transport layer <b>149</b>. In the first and second light-emitting layers <b>146</b> and <b>150</b>, recombination of the hole and electron thus injected takes place; and when an exciton generated by such recombination shifts from the excited state to the ground state, the phenomenon of light emission takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0220">Again with such a configuration, light emission takes place in the plural light-emitting layers of the first and second light-emitting layers <b>146</b> and <b>150</b>, leading to an increased quantity of light emitted by the organic electroluminescence element.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0221">By way of precaution, between the anode <b>130</b> and the cathode <b>31</b>, the insulating layer <b>148</b> need not always be sandwiched. In such a case, the anode <b>130</b> and the cathode <b>131</b> both sandwiched by the first light-emitting layer <b>146</b> and the second light-emitting layer <b>150</b> are unified to a common electrode that acts as a cathode injecting electrons into the first light-emitting layer <b>146</b>, and also as an anode injecting holes into the second light-emitting layer <b>148</b>, and a configuration is adopted consisting of a second hole transport layer <b>149</b>, a second light-emitting layer <b>150</b>, a second electron transport layer <b>151</b> and a cathode <b>131</b> stacked in this order. Alternatively, the anode <b>130</b> and cathode <b>131</b> both sandwiched between the first light-emitting layer <b>146</b> and the second light-emitting layer <b>150</b> is made a common electrode, and a configuration is adopted consisting of a second electron transport layer <b>151</b>, a second light-emitting layer <b>150</b>, a second hole transport layer <b>149</b> and an anode <b>130</b> stacked in this order.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0222">Again in the present embodiment, each of the individual organic thin film unit has a tri-layer structure consisting of a hole transport layer <b>145</b> (<b>149</b>), a light-emitting layer <b>146</b> (<b>150</b>) and an electron transport layer <b>147</b> (<b>151</b>). But, in addition to such a structure, the organic thin film unit may have a monolayer structure of a light-emitting layer alone or a double-layer structure of a hole transport layer coupled with a light-emitting layer or a light-emitting layer coupled with an electron transport layer. However, in the case of such double- or tri-layer structure, the structure is obtained with a stacking order so that the hole transport layer contacts with the anode or the electron transport layer contacts with the cathode. Alternatively, a structure in which an electron blocking layer is formed between a hole transport layer and a light-emitting layer, one in which a hole blocking layer is formed between a light-emitting layer and an electron transport layer, one in which a hole injection layer is formed between an anode and a hole transport layer, and one in which an electron injection layer is formed between an electron transport layer and a cathode, or further multi-layer structures in which function-separated layers are appropriately stacked or fabricated in mixed layers can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0223">Further, though in the illustrated case, two anodes <b>130</b> and two cathodes <b>131</b> are arranged alternately to each other, at least one anode and one cathode suffice, and either of the anode <b>130</b> or the cathode <b>131</b> may be arranged in continuum with an intervening insulating layer <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0224">In the present embodiment, the light-emitting layers and hole transport layers arranged between the first fabricated electrode and the subsequently fabricated one are preferably formulated with high polymer material which is less subject to damaging. In a monolayer structure of a light-emitting layer, a double-layer structure consisting of a light-emitting layer and an electron transport layer, and a tri-layer structure consisting of a hole transport layer, a light-emitting layer and an electron transport layer, any layer of these is preferably made of high polymer materials.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0225">In the description hereinabove, the organic electroluminescence element as the exposure light source is driven by dc; however, it may be driven by ac voltage or ac current, or further by wave pulse, too.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0226">Though the above explanation has been made for the case where the invention is applied to a color image-forming apparatus, the invention can be applied to a monochromatic, for example, black image-forming apparatus. In cases where the invention is applied to a color image-forming apparatus, the developing colors are not restricted to the four colors of yellow, magenta, cyan and black.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0227">The organic electroluminescence element in accordance with the invention, the exposure unit and the image-forming apparatus both using the element can be applied to the uses such as organic electroluminescence elements used as light-emitting elements in various apparatuses which require to enhance the light quantity emitted by the organic electroluminescence element, exposure units and image-forming apparatuses both using the element.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0228">As has been described hereinabove, according to the invention, in an exposure unit using the light which is emitted from the light-emitting layer of an organic electroluminescence element and irradiates from the light emerging plane composing the edge plane of a waveguide in the sub-scanning direction, the thickness of the light-emitting layer can easily be made large. Accordingly, a practically useful effect is attained that an exposure unit can be fabricated which is less subject to short circuit caused by the contamination of foreign matters or an electrode level difference even when the area of the light-emitting layer is large, exhibits a high yield of the exposure unit production and excels in a long term operation stability.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0229">Moreover, by adopting a configuration in which light emission takes place in a plurality of light-emitting layers, another useful effect is attained that an exposure unit can be fabricated in which the light quantity emitted by the organic electroluminescence element is large, exhibits a high yield of the exposure unit production and excels in a long term operation stability.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to transmission/reception of data between information processing apparatuses, and transmission/reception of image data photographed by an image pickup apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An image photographed by an image pickup apparatus is usually utilized by being transferred to and stored in a computer. This is because a flash memory card mainly used as a storage medium of an image pickup apparatus is more expensive in the cost per storage capacity than a storage medium (a hard disk, an MO (magnetooptical) disk or the like) of a computer. Accordingly, an image pickup apparatus is usually utilized in the sequence of &#x201c;a photographing operation&#x2192;transfer of image data to a computer&#x2192;storage of the transferred data in a storage medium of the computer&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The size of image data is relatively large from among the sizes of data dealt with in a computer, and is increasing year by year in accordance with an increase in the number of pixels of an image photographed by an image pickup apparatus. Accordingly, a certain amount of waiting time is produced when the user intends to transfer images to a computer at a time after returning from photographing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A filing system is constructed on a storage medium mounted in an image pickup apparatus, so that images are recorded in the form of files. Similarly, a computer records images in the form of files. That is, transfer of image data from the image pickup apparatus to the computer can be considered as transfer of files.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, when a waiting time is produced in file transfer (including in this case copying of files), a display indicating the degree of progress is performed. That is, the degree of completion in the entire transfer processing is indicated, for example, by a percentage, during the waiting time. The user can thereby know an approximate remaining time until completion of transfer (end of the waiting time). Such a display will be hereinafter termed a &#x201c;transfer-progress display&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The transfer-progress display is performed according to the following two approaches.
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">(1) Transfer-progress display based of the number of a file.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">(2) Transfer-progress display based of the size of files (=the size of transferred data).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">The two approaches are realized in the following manners.
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0012">(1) Transfer-progress display based of the number of a file</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0013">This display is used, for example, when assigning a plurality of (a large amount of) files on a window for displaying files on the picture surface of a computer, and copying a file to another folder. The total number of files to be transferred is first checked before the start of transfer, and the transfer-progress display is updated every time a file is copied.
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0014">(2) Transfer-progress display based of the size of files</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">This display is used, for example, when downloading a file in an Internet browser. The size of a file to be transferred is first acquired before the start of transfer, and the transfer-progress display is updated whenever necessary during the transfer, based on the size of received data.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">A transfer-progress display during image transfer from an image pickup apparatus to a computer will now be considered. In any of the above-described approaches (1) and (2), if a large amount of images to be transferred are present, a delay from the start of transfer processing to a transfer-progress display is produced, because of the following reasons.
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0017">(1) In the case of a transfer-progress display based of the number of a file</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">For example, problems arise when selecting a command such as &#x201c;transfer all images&#x201d; in software of image transfer from an image pickup apparatus, which operates in a computer. In this case, the software in the computer does not know the number of images within the image pickup apparatus. In order to acquire the number, the software requests the image pickup apparatus to transmit a summary of image files. The image pickup apparatus counts the number of images to be transmitted, in response to this request. The computer knows the number of images within the image pickup apparatus only after receiving a response to the request, and assumes a state in which a transfer-progress display can be performed. However, since, for example, the image pickup apparatus has a processing speed lower than the processing speed of the computer, a flash memory has an access speed lower than the access speed of an ordinary DRAM (dynamic random access memory), and there is a limitation in the transfer speed between the image pickup apparatus and the computer, a certain amount of time is required from provision of the request until reception of a response if a large amount of image files are present.
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0019">(2) In the case of a transfer-progress display based of the size of files</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0020">Software of image transfer from an image pickup apparatus, which operates in a computer must know the total size of data to be transferred (file sizes), when intending to perform a transfer-progress display according to this approach. For that purpose, it is necessary to provide the image pickup apparatus with a request to transmit file sizes for all images to be transmitted. Upon reception of the request, the image pickup apparatus calculates the total amount of data of image files to be transmitted from a filing system, and transmits a response to the computer. Accordingly, when a large amount of files to be transmitted are present, a considerable amount of time is required for acquiring the size of all data to be transferred (=the sum of file sizes of all images to be transferred).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0021">The object of the transfer-progress display is to display a progress of image transfer whenever necessary during image transfer because a considerable time is required for transferring the entire images. Accordingly, the transfer-progress display becomes meaningless if a considerable time is required from the start of processing until the transfer-progress display appears.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">It is an object of the present invention to solve all or at least one of the above-described problems.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(First Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating the configuration of a system according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there are shown an image pickup apparatus <b>1</b>, and a storage medium (a flash-memory card or the like) <b>2</b> mounted in the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b>. Reference numeral <b>3</b> represents a computer. The computer <b>3</b> performs display on a display <b>4</b>. A storage device (a hard disk, an MO disk or the like) <b>5</b> is incorporated or mounted in the computer <b>3</b>. Image-transfer software <b>6</b> including procedures according to the present invention operates in the computer <b>3</b>. Communication and transfer between the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> and the computer <b>3</b> is performed through a communication channel <b>7</b>. The communication channel <b>7</b> is a channel according to wired communication or radio communication, or via a network (a LAN (local area network) or the Internet).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">A filing system is constructed in the storage medium <b>2</b>. The image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> records data of a photographed image in the storage medium <b>2</b> as a file. Hereafter, an &#x201c;image within the digital camera <b>1</b>&#x201d; indicates an image file recorded in the storage medium <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">In contrast to a storage device in a computer where the user freely forms a file or a directory, the configuration of directories in the storage medium <b>2</b> is defined by standards or specifications. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of the configuration of directories.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0050">In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a DCIM directory is present below a root, and a plurality of xxxIMAGE directories (xxx represents a serial number set by the system, or an arbitrarily set number) are present below the DCIM directory. Image files (IMG_xxxx.JPG) are present below each xxxIMAGE directory. The image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> records each photographed image below a xxxIMAGE directory. When a constant number of files have been stored in the directory, a xxxIMAGE directory is newly formed (for example, a 101IMAGE directory is formed after a 100IMAGE directory), and files are recorded in the new directory. The constant number is usually several tens to several hundreds. In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, however, the constant number is three from a restriction in space. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, only eight images are shown from a restriction in space. However, the present invention assumes a state in which a large number of images, for example, several hundreds to several thousands of images, are present.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">Accordingly, if it is assumed that N images are recorded within the storage medium <b>2</b> with a specification of storing maximum M image files in one xxxIMAGE file, N/M (rounding up any numerical value after the decimal point) xxxIMAGE directories are present below the DCIM directory.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">Consider a situation in which the user using the image-transfer software <b>6</b> executes a function of &#x201c;transfer of all images within the image pickup apparatus at a time&#x201d;. As explained in the description of the related art, in order to perform a transfer-progress display in units of a file, it is necessary to first inquire and acquire the total number of image files within the storage medium <b>2</b> from the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">In the first embodiment, however, a signal indicating the state of transfer progress is generated in units of a xxxIMAGE directory, and a display indicating the degree of progress is performed using a progress bar or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">That is, the number of transmission directories having each data file to be transmitted as a subordinate directory is acquired, and the number of transmitted directories having each transmitted data file as a subordinate directory is also acquired (a directory all of whose subordinate data files to be transmitted have been transmitted is recognized as a transmitted directory).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">By comparing the number of transmission directories and the number of transmitted directories thus obtained with each other, the ratio of transmitted directories to the number of transmission directories may be calculated and displayed, or the difference between the number of transmission directories and the number of transmitted directories may displayed, in order to be able to recognize to what degree transmission has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">Every time transfer of subordinate image files of one xxxIMAGE directory has been completed, the transfer-progress display is updated. In this case, the total number of xxxIMAGE directories is asked to and acquired from the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b>. This can be performed in a much shorter time than in the case of acquiring the number of all image files (more specifically, the time is shortened by about 1/M).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">Instead, accuracy in the transfer-progress display (fineness in updating of display) is degraded (to about 1/M). However, since it is only necessary to know an approximate status of progress in the transfer-progress display, no problem will arise.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">This approach can be realized because the configuration of directories in a filing system of a transfer source is provided, and files are equally provided below each xxxIMAGE directory the number of whose subordinate files has reached a recordable number (of course, in a directory the number of whose subordinate files does not yet reach the recordable number, the files are not equally provided).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a procedure when performing a transfer-progress display according to the above-described approach.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0060">When the function of &#x201c;transfer of all images within the image pickup apparatus at a time&#x201d; has been instructed by the user, the image-transfer software <b>6</b> acquires information relating to the DCIM directory (step S<b>31</b>). The information relating to the DCIM directory is additional information relating to child directories and child files of the DCIM directory, a time stamp of each of these child components, and the like. This information is acquired by asking the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> and receiving a response from the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> via the communication channel <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0061">The number of xxxIMAGE directories below the DCIM directory is calculated based on the information acquired in step S<b>31</b> (step S<b>32</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0062">Then, a transfer-progress display is displayed (step S<b>33</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of the transfer-progress display. The degree of progress displayed on the picture surface is calculated by (the number of xxxIMAGE directories whose transfer has been completed)/(the total number of xxxIMAGE directories)&#xd7;100(%).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0063">Noticing one of the xxxIMAGE directories, information relating to this directory, i.e., information relating to child directories and child files of this directory, and additional information relating to these child components, is acquired from the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> (step S<b>34</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0064">An image file within this directory is transferred from the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> based on the information obtained in step S<b>34</b> (step S<b>35</b>), and is recorded in the storage device <b>5</b> (step S<b>36</b>). This operation is repeated for all image files within the directory (step S<b>37</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">If there remains at least one untransferred xxxIMAGE directory after completing the transfer of images within one xxxIMAGE directory, the process returns to step S<b>33</b>, where the transfer-progress display is updated, and transfer of images within the remaining directory is performed. When all xxxIMAGE directories have been transferred, the transfer-progress display is erased (step S<b>39</b>), and the process is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066">According to the above-described approach, all images within the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> can be transferred while updating the transfer-progress display in units of a xxxIMAGE directory.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067">Although in the first embodiment, the case of transfer between the image pickup apparatus and the computer has been described, the present invention is not limited to such a configuration, but may be applied to transfer of files between general electronic apparatuses.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Second Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0068">The configuration of a second embodiment of the present invention is the same as in the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0069">In the second embodiment, before performing transfer from the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> to the computer <b>3</b>, the capacity of use of the storage device <b>2</b> is first acquired, and a transfer-progress display is performed by comparing the acquired value with the amount of transferred data.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">In addition to image files, data of each image instructed to be printed by the user, and information necessary for the filing system itself (directory information and the like) are present in the storage medium <b>2</b>. However, most of the capacity of the storage device <b>2</b> is occupied by the files of photographed images. Accordingly, (the capacity of use of the storage medium <b>2</b>)&#x2248;(the amount of data of all photographed images), so that sufficient accuracy for performing a transfer-progress display is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart of the procedure of the second embodiment. When the user has instructed the image-transfer software <b>6</b> to transfer all images within the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> at a time, the contents shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are executed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0072">First, by asking the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> about the capacity of use of the storage device <b>2</b> and receiving a response from the storage device <b>2</b>, the capacity of use is acquired (step S<b>501</b>). If the filing system of the storage device <b>2</b> is a type of being incapable of directly acquiring the capacity of use, the total capacity and an empty capacity are acquired, and the capacity of use is obtained by (the capacity of use)=(the total capacity)&#x2212;(the empty capacity).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0073">Then, information relating to the DCIM directory is acquired form the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> (step S<b>502</b>). Thus, all xxxIMAGE directories below the DCIM directory are known.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0074">The size of transferred data is set to 0 (step S<b>503</b>). The size of transferred data is used for displaying transfer progress together with the capacity of use acquired in step S<b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0075">A transfer-progress display is performed (step S<b>504</b>). The degree of progress displayed at that time is, of course, 0.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0076">One of the xxxIMAGE directories obtained in step S<b>502</b> is selected, and information relating to the selected directory is acquired from the image pickup apparatus <b>1</b> (step S<b>505</b>). Thus, a summary of files present in the xxxIMAGE directory is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0077">One image file in the xxxIMAGE directory is transferred (step <b>8506</b>), and is stored in the storage device <b>5</b> (step S<b>507</b>). Then, the size of transferred data is updated (step S<b>508</b>). In the updating, the size of just transferred data is added to the size of transferred data. The transfer-progress display is updated based on the updated size of transferred data (step S<b>509</b>). The degree of progress displayed in this case is calculated by (the size of transferred data)/(the capacity of use of the recording medium <b>2</b>)&#xd7;100(%).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0078">The processing of steps S<b>506</b>&#x2013;S<b>510</b> is repeated until all images in the xxxIMAGE directory are transferred. Then, the processing of steps S<b>505</b>&#x2013;S<b>511</b> is repeated until all xxxIMAGE directories are transferred. Thus, all images within the storage medium <b>2</b> are transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0079">When the transfer has been completed, the transfer-progress display is erased (step S<b>512</b>), and the process is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0080">Any appropriate approach other that the above-described approach, for example, an approach of performing a display based on the difference, may also be adopted. Alternatively, only a numeral may be displayed. It is only necessary to be able to recognize an approximate status of progress.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0081">According to any one of the above-described approaches, it is possible to update the transfer-progress display every time a file has been transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0082">Although the second embodiment illustrates the case of transfer between the image pickup apparatus and the computer, the second invention is not limited to this configuration. The second embodiment may be applied to file transfer between general electronic apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0083">The foregoing description has been performed assuming that the storage medium <b>2</b> is mostly used. More specifically, the second embodiment is preferably applied to a case in which data is recorded in at least a predetermined capacity (close to a most capacity, for example, 90%) of the entire storage capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0084">If data is recorded in a capacity less than the predetermined capacity, switching may be performed so as to adopt the approach of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Third Embodiment)</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a flowchart illustrating a third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0086">In the third embodiment, only steps S<b>508</b> and S<b>509</b> in the second embodiment are replaced by steps S<b>608</b> and S<b>609</b>, respectively. The steps S<b>608</b> and S<b>609</b> are executed in parallel during transfer of an image file (step S<b>506</b>). Even during transfer of the file, the size of transferred data is updated whenever necessary in accordance with transferred data, and the transfer-progress display is also updated. Accordingly, in contrast to the second embodiment in which the transfer-progress display is updated every time transfer of one file has been completed, in the third embodiment, the transfer-progress display is updated without cease even during transfer of a file.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0087">Although the third embodiment illustrates transfer between an image pickup apparatus and a computer, the third embodiment is not limited to this configuration. The third embodiment may also be applied to file transfer between general electronic apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0088">The transmission directory and the transmitted directory used in the foregoing description may be a directory dedicatedly set for transmission and a directory dedicatedly set for completed transmission. However, the setting is not limited to such setting.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0089">A preset directory name be used whether a corresponding directory is to be transmitted or not, and a directory where a file to be transmitted is present at a subordinate position may be used as the above-described transmission directory. Similarly, a directory where a transmitted file is present at a subordinate position may be used as the above-described transmitted directory.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0090">Although in the foregoing embodiments, the case of transmitting all images within the storage device at a time has been described, the present invention may also be applied to case in which the user transmits a plurality of selected images.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0091">In this case, the number of transmission directories and transmitted directories, each having at least one image to be transmitted present at a subordinate position, may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0092">In another approach, switching may be appropriately performed between the approach <b>1</b> (in which a transfer-progress display is performed in units of a file) and the approach <b>2</b> (in which a transfer-progress display is performed in units of a file size) which have been described above, in accordance with the user's taste or the state of use.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0093">For example, when the number of transmission directories, each having at least one data file to be transmitted at a subordinate position is small, or when there is a large difference between the number of data files present below a certain directory and the number of data files present below a different directory, updating in the status of progress is apt to vary. That is, updating may become abruptly fast or slow.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0094">Accordingly, when it is intended to know a more exact status of progress although much time is required, an appropriate predetermined threshold may be provided for each of the number of files and the number of directories, and an approach of checking the status of progress may be appropriately switched between the approach of the present invention, and the approach <b>1</b> (in which a transfer-progress display is performed in units of a file) or the approach <b>2</b> (in which a transfer-progress display is performed in units of a file size), in accordance with the difference between these thresholds.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0095">Alternatively, the approach of checking the status of progress may be switched depending on the display capability of a display unit for displaying the status of progress.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0096">For example, when the number of transmission directories is only about ten, and a display in which the status-progress display can be updated in 100 steps from 0% to 100%, updating of the display tends to become abruptly fast or slow. In such a case, by obtaining the degree of progress based on the number of data files which are larger in the number, a display suitable for the display capability can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0097">On the other hand, when, for example, 10,000 image files are present, even if the degree of progress is updated every time a file has been transmitted, updating of display is performed at only about one hundredth of updating of the degree of progress because the display has only 100 steps.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0098">In such a case, since a useless calculation processing is performed, the degree of progress may be checked based on the number of transmission directories, from the viewpoint of reducing the load of processing of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0099">Switching of the method for checking the degree of progress depending of the display capability of the display unit in the above-described manner is also effective.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0100">In the above-described embodiments, for example, the number of directories is requested to a digital camera which is connected to a personal computer, or the status of progress is displayed on a display device of the personal computer, by control at the personal computer, such processing may be performed by control at the digital camera.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0101">That is, the number of directories in the personal computer may be independently transmitted from the digital camera , or the status of progress may be displayed on a display device of the digital camera.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0102">Furthermore, the above-described embodiments may be applied not only to the case of transferring image data from the digital camera to the personal computer, but also at both of the transmission side and the reception side of an information processing system for transferring a data file between information processing apparatuses, each including a storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0103">However, in a file format called a DCF (Design rule for Camera File system R) adopted at the digital camera, the number of files which can be recorded in one directory is fixed, so that the above-described embodiments may be suitably utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0104">If the capacity of a storage medium, such as a memory card or the like, increases, the number of recorded images and the number of directories necessarily increases, so that the above-described embodiments may be more suitably utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0105">The present invention may be applied to a system comprising a plurality of apparatuses (such as a host computer, an interface apparatus, a reader, a printer and the like), or to an apparatus comprising a single unit (such as a copier, a facsimile apparatus or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0106">A case of supplying a computer within an apparatus or a system connected to various devices so as to operate the devices in order to realize the functions of the above-described embodiments with program codes of software for realizing the functions of the above-described embodiments, and operating the devices in accordance with a program stored in the computer (a CPU (central processing unit) or an MPU (microprocessor unit)) within the apparatus or the system also constitutes the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0107">In such a case, the program codes themselves of the software realize the functions of the above-described embodiments, so that means for supplying the computer with the program codes, such as a storage medium storing the program codes, also constitutes the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0108">For example, a floppy disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a mangetooptical disk, a CD(compact disc)-ROM (read-only memory), a magnetic tape, a nonvolatile memory card, a ROM or the like may be used as the storage medium for storing such program codes.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0109">Such program codes are, of course, included in the above-described embodiments of the present invention not only in a case in which the functions of the above-described embodiments are realized by execution of the supplied program codes by a computer, but also in a case in which the program codes realize the functions of the above-described embodiments in cooperation with an OS (operating system) operating in a computer, any other application software or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0110">A case in which after storing supplied program codes in a memory provided in a function expanding board of a computer or in a function expanding unit connected to the computer, a CPU or the like provided in the function expanding board or the function expanding unit performs a part or the entirety of actual processing based on instructions of the program codes, the functions of the above-described embodiments are realized by the processing is, of course, included in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0111">Although in the foregoing description, processing of transferring data files or image files is illustrated, the present invention is not limited to such an approach. For example, the present invention may, of course, be applied to any other image processing, such as reduction, rotation, color correction, printing or the like of an image, file operation processing such as copying or deletion of a file, data compression processing, encoding or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0112">In such image processing or file operation processing, it is also possible to recognize the status of progress and display the status on a display device or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0113">In such a case, the above-described transfer processing may be replaced by predetermined image processing or file operation processing. Hence, a detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0114">As described above, according to the present invention, a signal indicating a status of progress of transfer of data files is output based on the number of transmission directories acquired by transmission-directory acquisition means and the number of transmitted directories acquired by transmitted-directory acquisition means. Hence, even if a large number of photographed images are present within an image pickup device, processing of checking the degree of progress of transmission is less burdened and promptly performed. Furthermore, a display of the degree of progress is not delayed. That is, it is possible to promptly perform a transfer-progress display after an instruction to start transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0115">In a system in which an upper limit is set for the number of data files capable of being stored in each directory, accuracy in the degree of progress is less degraded. Hence, the present invention is suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0116">By switching to a method of checking the status of progress of data transfer based on the number of data files to be transmitted and the number of transmitted data files, or to a method of checking the status of progress of data transfer based on the total amount of data of data files to be transmitted and the total number of data of transmitted data files, it is possible to switch the method for checking the degree of progress depending on a situation, for example, a situation in which accuracy is required.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0117">By switching the method for checking the status of transfer progress in accordance with the display capability of a display device for displaying the number of transmission directories or the status of transfer progress, an appropriate degree of progress can be provided depending on the situation.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0118">The degree of progress is determined by acquiring the capacity of use of a storage device of an information processing apparatus, serving as a transfer source, and the amount of transferred data and obtaining the ratio between these amounts. Hence, even when transferring a large amount of data files, it is unnecessary to calculate the capacity for each file, and it is possible to check the degree of progress with simple processing.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0119">That is, processing of determining the degree of transfer progress is less burdened and promptly performed. Furthermore, a display of the degree of progress is not delayed. That is, a transfer-progress display can be promptly performed after instructing to start transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0120">The present invention is suitable for a case in which a digital camera is used as an apparatus at the transmission side.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0121">Transmission of images of a digital camera to a computer is frequently performed. Recently, the number of images recorded in a recording medium of the digital camera is increasing to several hundreds to several thousands. Even if start of display of the degree of progress is delayed in accordance with an increase in the number of images to be transferred, the present invention can sufficiently deal with. Since the calculation processing capability of a digital camera is relatively low compared with that of a computer, the present invention in which a load in calculation can be reduced is very suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0122">The individual components shown in outline in the drawings are all well known in the information processing and image-pickup arts and their specific construction and operation are not critical to the operation or the best mode for carrying out the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0123">While the present invention has been described with respect to what are presently considered to be the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a multimedia terminal for telephony allowing multipoint connections to a plurality of other terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Multipoint connections between a plurality of subscribers to a communication network are known as conference circuits controlled by a central conference circuit control provided in the communication network. In this context it is known to provide multipoint control units (MCU) in a communication network. In the case of a multipoint connection that uses such multipoint control units, terminals each have a point-to-point connection to the multipoint control unit. This multipoint control unit performs a multipoint function called multipoint processing. This involves handling the datastreams of the individual point-to-point connections, with other datastreams coming from the individual terminals being mixed together and the mixture which is produced in each case being transmitted to the individual terminals. Such a procedure is for example described in the ITU-T Standard H.323, Section 6.8.1, under the term &#x201c;centralized conference&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multipoint communication using a decentralized control, in which a multipoint controller is provided only for processing multipoint signaling, is also known. Such a decentralized multipoint control can be implemented in a terminal or a multipoint control unit, for example. For this multipoint communication, each of the terminals involved transmits the useful information to a multicast address, which is determined by the multipoint controller. The multipoint controller assigns a plurality of different multicast addresses and notifies each terminal of a multicast address for the information it has to transmit. Each terminal thus transmits to a special multicast address and receives the information transmitted to the other multicast addresses assigned by the multipoint controller. To this end, all the terminals involved need to support multicast functions. As an alternative to using multicast, a so-called multi-unicast can also be provided. For this multi-unicast method, the terminals use multiple point-to-point connections to transmit each of the datastreams to be transmitted to the other terminals involved in the multipoint connection.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such a communication principle is, for example, described in the ITU-T Standard H.323, Section 6.8.2, under the term &#x201c;decentralized conference&#x201d;. In order to establish a multipoint communication using a decentralized controller or control based on this standard, on the basis of an existing call between a first subscriber A and a second subscriber B, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">At least one of the subscribers A and B must have a terminal with a multipoint controller, or an available gatekeeper must have a multipoint controller.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">All the terminals involved must support multicast functions or multi-unicast functions.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">A gatekeeper is a logic function for performing standard functions such as address resolution or bandwidth management. In this context, address resolution means that a calling endpoint transmits to the gatekeeper a so-called alias address for an endpoint which is to be called, and receives from the gatekeeper the transport address, that is to say the Internet protocol address and the port number. The gatekeeper knows the volume of traffic with respect to real-time applications within the network area for which it is responsible.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">In addition, the subscriber A or B who is starting a consultation call with a further subscriber C while a call is being made between subscribers A and B must usually determine, when this consultation call is actually being set up, whether the subscriber C to be consulted is to be included in the call between subscribers A and B through the use of a multipoint connection.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">The different ways of setting up a multipoint connection using a centralized control or a decentralized control, as described above, do not allow a three-subscriber conference to be set up flexibly on the basis of a two-subscriber call with a consultation call.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a multimedia terminal which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known terminals of this general type and which allows a multipoint communication between terminals to be set up flexibly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a multimedia terminal for telephony based on ITU-T Standard H.323 for setting up a multipoint connection to a plurality of terminals, including a controller for processing signaling information for a point-to-multipoint connection between the multimedia terminal and a plurality of terminals; and a mixer, connected to the controller, for mixing datastreams originating at the multimedia terminal and at the plurality of terminals and for providing datastream mixtures to the plurality of terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">In accordance with another feature of the invention, the mixer provides to each respective one of the plurality of terminals a respective one of the datastream mixtures, which includes a mixture of the datastreams originating at the multimedia terminal and at a respective other one of the plurality of terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">With the objects of the invention in view there is also provided, a multimedia terminal, including a function module for setting up a multipoint connection to a first terminal and to a second terminal based on ITU-T Standard H.323; a controller, connected to the function module, for processing signaling information for a point-to-multipoint connection between the multimedia terminal, the first terminal, and the second terminal; and a mixer, connected to the controller, for mixing datastreams originating at the multimedia terminal, at the first terminal, and at the second terminal and for providing datastream mixtures to the first terminal and to the second terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">In accordance with a further feature of the invention, the mixer provides to the first terminal a respective one of the datastream mixtures including a mixture of the datastreams originating at the multimedia terminal and at the second terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">The invention achieves its object through the use of a novel multimedia terminal for telephony based on the ITU-T Standard H.323 for producing multipoint connections to a plurality of other terminals. Such a terminal has a controller or, in more general terms, a control for processing a signaling for point-to-multipoint connections. It also contains a device for mixing datastreams originating from terminals involved in the multipoint connection and for providing datastream mixtures to these terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">The controller or control for processing a signaling information for point-to-multipoint connections allows point-to-point connections to a plurality of other terminals to be set up simultaneously. In addition, this control allows to establish a point-to-multipoint connection configuration which, with the help of the device for mixing datastreams originating from the terminals involved in the multipoint connection and for providing datastream mixtures to these terminals, functions or operates as a multipoint-to-multipoint connection for all the terminals involved.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">Point-to-point connections can be set up using the regular setup message based on ITU-T H.323, for example. If there are already one or more point-to-point connections between a terminal according to the invention and remote endpoints, these connections can be put into a &#x201c;hold&#x201d; state before a new point-to-point connection is established by using a &#x201c;near end hold&#x201d; or &#x201c;far end hold&#x201d; message based on the ITU-T Draft Recommendation H.450.4. The point-to-point connection to a further terminal can then be made using a conventional setup message based on ITU-T H.323, for example. When a conference connection is established between all the terminals to which there are point-to-point connections, the control of the multimedia terminal according to the invention transmits a facility message &#x201c;ConferenceIndication.Invoke&#x201d;, for example, requesting that an existing conference circuit be indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">In a particular embodiment of a terminal according to the invention, this control or controller can also output control channel messages of the &#x201c;MultipointConference&#x201d;-type or the &#x201c;CommunicationModeCommand&#x201d;-type based on the ITU-T Standard H.242 and in particular ITU-T H.323V2, Appendix I.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">The &#x201c;CommunicationModeCommand&#x201d; message can be output, for example, in order to cause a remote endpoint to which there is a point-to-point connection to close one transmission channel and open another transmission channel. One reason for this could be that an embodiment of a multimedia terminal according to the invention is not able to mix the output signals from different audio codecs. If one of the subscribers to an intended conference circuit now has only one codec based on ITU-T G.711 available, another subscriber can be requested to close a transmission channel for data coded on the basis of ITU-T G.723.1 and to change to another transmission channel for data coded on the basis of ITU-T G.711.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">Another reason for outputting a &#x201c;CommunicationModeCommand&#x201d; message can be that the endpoints of a scheduled conference circuit are capable of multicasting. In this case, the &#x201c;CommunicationModeCommand&#x201d; message can contain the multicast addresses to which the endpoints are to transmit their useful information. In this application, the terminals at all the endpoints would have to be capable of receiving and mixing the datastreams before forwarding them to the appropriate subscriber. The mixing device of the terminal according to the invention would provide no datastream mixtures for the other endpoints.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">Also, if the terminal according to the invention wishes to receive the datastreams from different endpoints via different addresses, an existing connection can be changed using the &#x201c;CommunicationModeCommand&#x201d; message, in order to establish a conference circuit. In this case, too, the &#x201c;CommunicationModeCommand&#x201d; message would be used to transmit to the endpoint, to which there is a point-to-point connection, the address to which information arriving from this endpoint is be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">In a further embodiment of a multimedia terminal according to the invention, the control for point-to-multipoint signaling may be set up to use the &#x201c;TerminalCapabilitySet=0&#x201d; message in order to close and to reopen logical channels based on the ITU-T Standard H.323V2, section 8.4.6 &#x201c;Third Party Initiated Pause and Re-Routing&#x201d;. The &#x201c;TerminalCapabilitySet&#x201d; message is usually used by a terminal to notify another terminal of what communication possibilities or communication opportunities it has available. In this context, the limits of these possibilities can be determined both, technically&#x2014;due to hardware or software not being available&#x2014;and, alternatively, by defined authorizations. In order to initiate an existing useful data connection between two terminals, the control can transmit, for example to each of these terminals, a &#x201c;TerminalCapabilitySet&#x201d; message which implies that the respective other terminal has no communication possibilities or communication opportunities available. The two terminals recognize these messages as a message transmitted by the respective other terminal. Since each of these terminals has been informed that the terminal, to which there are logical channels open, has no communication possibilities available, these logical channels are switched off or disconnected.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">The device for mixing datastreams originating from the terminals involved in the multipoint connection and for providing datastream mixtures to these terminals allows a conference circuit to be established on the basis of a plurality of point-to-point connections between a multimedia terminal according to the invention and other terminals. In this case, the other terminals require no particular multipoint functionality or multitask functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">In a preferred embodiment of a multimedia terminal according to the invention, the device for mixing provides each of the terminals involved in the multipoint connection with a datastream mixture of datastreams originating from the other terminals involved in the multipoint connection. This ensures that each of the terminals involved in a multipoint connection receives the information from all the other terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a multimedia terminal for telephony allowing multipoint connections, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">Referring now to the figures of the drawings in detail and first, particularly, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> thereof, there is shown an exemplary embodiment of a multimedia terminal MM-terminal according to the invention in a schematic block diagram in the form of its expanded protocol layer model. As is usual in networks based on ITU-T H.323, the communication of the terminal MM-terminal is based on the Internet protocol IP. Taking the Internet protocol IP as a basis, the right-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the protocol stack for the signaling, which handles the call control.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">In this case, on the basis of the Internet protocol IP and the signaling protocol TCP, a function module H.225.0 based on the ITU-T Protocol H.225.0 is provided for a basic call control signaling in H.323 networks. Exemplary messages for this function module H.225.0 are SETUP or CONNECT.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">Also, on the basis of the signaling protocol TCP, there is a function module H.245 based on the ITU-T Control Protocol H.245. This function module H.245 is used, among other things, for exchanging &#x201c;TerminalCapability&#x201d; messages, that is to say for submitting and receiving information regarding terminal capabilities. This function module H.245 is also used for defining task distributions such as master and slave functions and for opening and closing logical channels used for useful data transmissions. The function module H.245 is also responsible for messages such as &#x201c;MultipointConference&#x201d;, &#x201c;CommunicationModeCommand&#x201d; or &#x201c;EnableDecentralizedConference&#x201d; in a network based on ITU-T H.323. These messages are necessary for the above-described methods for producing a multipoint conference and are optionally usable in a multimedia terminal according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">On top of the function module H.225.0, there are function modules of additional facility controllers or features controls, such as, according to the invention, the function module &#x201c;CONTROL CONFERENCE&#x201d;, which corresponds to a controller or control for processing a signaling for point-to-multipoint connections within the context of the invention. As further function modules of additional facility controllers or feature controls, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, by way of example, a function module H.450 &#x201c;HOLD&#x201d; for producing or implementing a &#x201c;HOLD&#x201d; function based on ITU-T H.450, and a further function module H.450 having further variants, indicated by dots, based on the ITU-T Standard H.450.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, on the left next to the signaling stack described above, a useful data stack. This useful data stack is also based on the Internet protocol IP, on which there is UDP and on that, in turn, a real-time protocol RTP. In addition to the real-time protocol RTP, the protocol UDP also supports a real-time control protocol RTCP and that part H.225.0 RAS of the control protocol according to ITU-T H.225.0 which concerns the areas of registration, administration, and status.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">On the basis of the real-time protocol RTP, there are codecs or at least decoders for audio and video, which are denoted by AUDIO, VIDEO in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Such audio codecs AUDIO are configured according to one of the ITU-T Standards G.711, G.723.1, or G.728, for example. Audio decoders AUDIO are for example also defined by ISO MPEG4 standards. ISO MPEG4 also defines corresponding video decoders VIDEO. When decoders based on ISO MPEG4 are used, proprietary coders are possibly contained in a multimedia terminal MM-TERMINAL according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">The real-time control protocol RTCP and the codecs or decoders for audio and video AUDIO, VIDEO are controlled by a media controller MEDIA CONTROL which, among other things, is responsible for the interaction of media input devices INPUT-DEVICE and media output devices OUTPUT-DEVICE provided in the multimedia terminal MM-TERMINAL. In this respect, media input devices INPUT-DEVICE are, for example, cameras for video data, microphones for audio data or interfaces for data sources not included in the multimedia terminal MM-TERMINAL. In this context, output devices OUTPUT-DEVICE are, for example, a screen for video data, loudspeakers for audio data or interfaces for output devices not included contained in the multimedia terminal MM-TERMINAL, such as printers or bulk memories.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0042">The terminal TeC uses a Connect message to acknowledge to the terminal TeA the Setup message previously received from the latter. A consultation connection in the form of logical channels is then set up between the terminals TeA and TeC. If the subscriber A associated with the terminal TeA wants a conference circuit at this instant, the terminal TeA transmits a facility message FAC(ConferenceIndication.inv) to each of the terminals TeB and TeC in order to indicate that a conference configuration is being called or selected. If, before a Setup message was transmitted to the terminal TeC, the terminal TeA had transmitted a message FAC(HoldNotific.inv) to the terminal TeB, the terminal TeB can be put back again into an active state from the &#x201c;hold&#x201d; state by a message FAC (RetrieveNotific.inv) received from the terminal TeA. The logical channels between the terminals TeA, TeB, and TeC, which were already open before the conference was started, continue to be used.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">This invention relates to IQ (In-phase component and Quadrature-phase component) modulation of signals, and particularly though not exclusively to IQ modulation in wireless transmitters for communications systems such as cellular communications systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">IQ modulators are commonly found in wireless transmitter applications providing multimode modulations, i.e., modulations in a desired one of multiple modes such as EDGE (Enhanced Data-rates for GSM Evolution), IS136 (Second generation TDMA air interface standard), IDEN (Integrated Digital Enhanced Network), ICO (Intermediate Circular Orbit), IS95 (CDMA air interface standard) and other schemes using linear modulation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">In the field of this invention it is known that IQ modulation may be performed by using finite impulse response filters (FIR's) operating at an oversampling ratio (of the sampling rate of the I and Q samples) with coefficients equal in number to the product of the oversampling ratio and the span length times of the I and Q samples.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">It is desirable to provide a low cost and programmable modulator to handle particularly the following different operating modes (MA's):
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">EDGE in DCR (Direct Conversion Receiver) or DVLIF (Digital Very-Low Intermediate Frequency) modes with high oversampling clocks</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">IDEN and IS136 in interpolation modes with high oversampling clocks</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0007">IS95 in DCR mode with high oversampling clocks</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">In order to meet the requirements of low cost and programmability, such a modulator should have:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0009">low integrated circuit (IC) gate count;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0010">high oversampling ratio (e.g., greater than 4);</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0011">reduced sets of coefficients for software transmitter (TX) handover between MA's without IC re-programming.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0012">low power consumption</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0013">However, such combined requirements have been difficult to meet.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0014">A need therefore exists for an IQ modulator and method wherein the abovementioned disadvantage(s) may be alleviated.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Prior Art</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0015">U.S. Pat. No. 6,031,431 (Sanjay) discloses a simplified IQ modulator and method. A Nyquist filter is used with an interpolator. This performs both pulse shaping and interpolation functions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0016">European Patent Application EP-A-0881 764 (Commquest) describes a method for variable-rate down sampling. An anti aliasing filter matches the sampling rate and a frequency controlled oscillator ensues that frequency synthesis is maintained in the digital domain.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Statement of Invention</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0028">In a preferred IQ modulator for a low-cost re-programmable IC implementation for portable cellular applications, a multi-accumulator polynomial generator is used. Use of the multi-accumulator polynomial generator allows any desired type of pulse-shaping filter to be achieved, the impulse response on each symbol period being approximated by a 4<sup>th </sup>order polynomial expression, where the coefficients of each of the four orders is expressed as X1d(i), X2d(i), X3d(i) and X4d(i), where i is the corresponding symbol period index. Rather than having finite impulse response filters (FIR's) operating at the oversampling ratio, they operate at the symbol period 1X.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the signal processing flow for producing the filter coefficients for such a 4<sup>th </sup>order FIR operating at the symbol period 1X.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0030">For example, in EDGE mode, the impulse response span over 5 symbol periods, so only 5 taps per FIR are required, resulting in complexity equal to 5*270.8333*4=5410 kilo-operations per second (270.8333 ksym/s being the required EDGE symbol period); in North American Digital Cellular (NADC) mode, the impulse response spans over 9 symbol periods, so 9taps per FIR is required, resulting in complexity equal to 9*24.3:*4=874.8 kilo-operations per second (24.3 ksym/s being the required NADC symbol period).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">More generally, it will be appreciated that the complexity for a waveform generator approach is equal to: Span*1X*Derivative Order, where Span is the number of symbols that the impulse response spans, and Derivative Order is the maximum derivative order chosen to approximate the impulse response with a desired accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">It should be noted that if a traditional FIR approach operating at the oversampling ratio were chosen, then a 5*16 tap FIR operating at 16X the sample period would be required for EDGE mode operation. Although some implementations can reduce the number of taps to 5, the complexity of such a traditional approach would still be 5.*16*270.8333=21667 kilo-operations per seconds, i.e., still 4 times more complex than the multi-accumulator approach of the present example.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">It will be appreciated that the complexity increases as the oversampling ratio increases. The oversampling clock (i.e., the output clock) is usually increased the due to the need to reduce the image frequency components and to reduce the order of the analog reconstruction filters after the digital-to-analog converters and to the need to spread the quantization noise over a wider bandwidth to increase the output signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">However, it will be understood that with the invention, the FIR's are not required to operate at the output oversampling frequency, but at the same frequency as the input rate (e.g., at the symbol rate when used for pulse-shaping operation, or at the input rate when used for interpolation) while only the polynomial waveform generator based on a multi-accumulator structure that operates at the oversampling clock rate, allowing higher oversampling clock rates and allowing programmable output clocks without the need to change the FIR's coefficients or structure. Thus, in the invention the oversampling clock can be made programmable without the need to change any programming coefficients or adding complexity, it only requires changing the clock value.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown the signal processing flow arrangement <b>100</b> for producing FIR coefficients with a 6 symbol span length and with a 4<sup>th </sup>order Derivative (as required for EDGE mode operation with pre-distortion).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0036">As can be seen, the signal processing flow arrangement <b>100</b> has four groups of multipliers <b>112</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>142</b>, each of which receives a respective coefficient (X1d(0) to X4d(5)) and an appropriate I symbol value Iin(n) to Iin(n&#x2212;4). It will be understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the signal processing flow only for I symbol processing, and that a similar signal processing flow occurs for Q symbol processing. The outputs of the multipliers are applied to summation nodes <b>114</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>134</b> and <b>144</b>, which sum the respective multiplier outputs in each group to produce the four order outputs x1d, x2d, x3d and x4d, which are applied to a multi-accumulator structure (as will be explained) which forms a polynomial waveform generator.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0037">The operation can-therefore be described as follows:

</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the FIR coefficients produced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are applied to inputs of a polynomial waveform generator <b>200</b> operating at the system oversampling ratio OVSX, which is chosen in the present example as OVSX=16 for EDGE mode operation. In the present example a fourth order polynomial waveform generator is used.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0039">As can be seen, the polynomial waveform generator <b>200</b> utilises the outputs x1d, x2d, x3 and x4d (together with a further set of values x0d (which are a set of programmable fixed initial values that are loaded at the start of the transmission to set an initial trajectory point and/or to compensate a DC offset value) with adders <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>242</b>, accumulator registers <b>214</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>244</b> and shift registers <b>216</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>246</b> (to divide by a power of 2 by right-shifting by 2, 3 or 4 bits as desired) to progressively accumulate the I (or Q) values which are output from the generator as signals Iout (or Qout).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040">The accumulators <b>244</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>224</b> load (at each symbol clock pulse at the clock rate finX) the values x3d, x2d, x1d and then accumulate (at each clock pulse at the clock rate fovs) in order to calculate the first order derivative, while the last accumulator <b>214</b> is continuously accumulating without re-initialization of its value except at the beginning of the transmission burst.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">The word output Iout (or Qout) can be expressed as, (assuming a divide-by-OVSD happening in the shift registers <b>246</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>216</b> section, and an OVSX oversampling ratio=fovs/f1x):</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0051">By solving above equations (3), the coefficients X1d, X2d, X3d, X4d are extracted to match the impulse response.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">Comparative measurements between IQ modulators utilizing the above approach and IQ modulators using the traditional prior art approach have shown significant similarity between the results of the two approaches.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">It may be noted that since OVSX is chosen to be a power of 2 number, the division inside the waveform generator OVSD is performed by shifting right the bits depending on the chosen value OVSX.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">It is also possible to do a non-power of 2 interpolation factor where the oversampling clock fovs is any integer number multiplier relative to the input rate finX (i.e., fovsX=FinX*OVSX), while the <b>246</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>216</b> values OVSD are shift right operations.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">Also, it is possible to program different coefficients between the I and Q path in order to provide Image Rejection Enhancement for Direct Launch systems where greater sensitivity to I/Q gain and phase mismatch is observed at 2 GHz or above.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">Also, it is possible to pre-distort the impulse response so as to compensate the subsequent analog reconstruction filters (not shown) and so as to enable a better compromise between noise output and EVM due to the selected bandwidth, i.e., lower bandwidth will lower the noise level but will increase EVM due to an increase of group and amplitude ripple.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">In the case of EDGE mode operation as an example, the serial data are at 3x times the symbol rate. A phase mapping &#x2018;3&#x3a0;/8 O8PSK&#x2019; is performed which gives 16 different phase values, commonly called &#x201c;phasemod&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">A Low IF mode can be selected through the software programming interface (SPI) by adding to the phasemod a linear phase increment depending on the IF value selected by a SPI programming bit. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the IF linear phase increment is implemented using accumulators <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> operating at 1X, having as inputs I and Q phase corrections that are programmed through SPI bits Iphaseadjust and Qphaseadjust.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">The output phase(s) of the IF phase generator(s) are added to the phase mapping output phasemod to address a ROM table (not shown) to generate the cosine and sine terms on complement of 2 10-bit words, TM_I and TM_Q, at the programmed input frequency (fin) rate (normally 1X).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0060">In Low IF mode, the I and Q outputs TM_I and TM_Q are frequency shifted by the programmed IF value, requiring then that the pulsing shaping filter be also shifted in frequency, to avoid low pass filtering the modulation that is now IF centered.

<p id="p-0056" num="0061">The FIR 1X filter referred to above thus becomes a complex FIR filter, as shown in the overall block diagram of the programmable pulse-shaping complex digital IQ modulator <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0062">The complex FIR <b>410</b> that operates at an input frequency (fin) which is normally at 1X (i.e., at the symbol rate) is based on a real and imaginary FIR's (<b>510</b> and <b>520</b> respectively), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0063">It may be noted that in IF=0 mode, the imaginary coefficients will be programmed to 0, such that real pulse shaping only is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0064">The implementation of the FIR at 1X could be optimized in die area by replacing the n multipliers operating at 1X by a single multiplier operating at n*1X, i.e., a change from parallel to serial FIR implementation. The choice of whether to implement this optimization is left to the discretion of the designer, based on the IC process speed and density.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">Also, it is possible to replace the multiplier at 1X rate or n*1X rate by a ROM table (not shown) that is addressed by input Iin or Qin, if no programmability is required for the coefficients.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066">It will be understood that a ROM table in a traditional approach would increase in size versus the oversampling clock and would be required to change versus programming the oversampling clock, while in the case of the present invention the ROM table does not change (either it size or it contents) with the oversampling clock (since it operates at symbol rate data).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an example of a serial (shared, multiplexed) FIR implementation <b>600</b> of 6 taps*4 FIR*1X rate which may be used an alternative to the multiple (parallel) multiplier arrangement described above.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0068">Complex pulse shaping at 1X rate allows a Low IF mode for lower EVM by having the image shifted at Low IF and reducing LO leakage effect on EVM and having a loop injection LO (if present) non-harmonically related to the main TX frequency for additional reduction of LO re-modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0069">Also, complex pulse-shaping can pre-distort any TX IF filter group delay and amplitude for additional EVM improvement.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">For EDGE for example, the reconstruction filter has some effect on the EVM of the modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0071">The impulse response could be pre-distorted for a given bandwidth setting (where no radio phasing is required). A span of 6 symbols is enough for the pre-distortion since the bandwidth of such reconstruction filters are in the range of 400&#x2013;600 KHz.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0072">It will be appreciated that, due to the presence of the multi-accumulator waveform generator, it is possible to re-use this block as an interpolator of 4th order. Since NADC mode operation requires a span over 9 symbols, rather than having to generate 9 coefficients per filter at 1X the interpolation mode as described below could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0073">In bypass mode, rather than transferring one bit serial data on TSDTX, pulse-shaped I/Q data are sent over the SSI (the modulation being performed in software) for narrow band systems. The I/Q data arrive at a rate FinX that can be programmed through a host processor. As an example, NADC I/Q data at a rate of 16X (388 kilo-data per second), and an interpolation factor of 8, results on interpolated I/Q data's of 3.1104 Mhz at the DAC input.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0074">In the interpolation mode, the coefficients of the FIR's are programmed such that the waveform generator output fits the input at FinX and its various derivatives calculated at FinX.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0075">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, some digital-to-analog converters (such as the D-to-A implementation <b>700</b>) have an oversampled structure called Delta-Sigma D/A's where the oversampling clock fovs<b>2</b> is usually 40 to 100 times the input symbol clock. If prior art pulse shaping filter were used, the FIR multipliers would be limited in speed to fovs<b>1</b> so the output word Iout<b>1</b> (or Qout<b>1</b>) will only be oversampled at fovs<b>1</b> and their associated digital quantization noise is spread only at +/&#x2212;fovs<b>1</b>/<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0076">Another possible TX processing arrangement inserts interpolation stages between the pulse-shaping FIR and the Delta-Sigma Modulators as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Such a structure as the arrangement <b>800</b> suffers however from modulation accuracy (EVM) for some MA's like EDGE, due to the nature of the interpolation structure, mainly when the interpolation factor is high (i.e., fovs<b>2</b>/fovs<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0077">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, to improve on the disadvantageous arrangements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the present invention may make use of the IQ waveform generator processing arrangement <b>900</b>, based on the above IQ waveform generator replacing the pulse-shaping FIR by first-order, second-order, etc. derivative FIR's operating at the symbol rate clock and feeding a multi-accumulators waveform generator, where the multi-accumulator waveform generator operates directly at a higher clock rate, and particularly at fovs<b>2</b>, similar to the Delta-Sigma Modulators clock rates, since the accumulators can operate at higher clock speeds, thus allowing the quantization noise to spread directly over +&#x2212;fovs<b>2</b>/<b>2</b> and without the need to increase complexity since the FIR's operate at the symbol rate clock. In this way, the multi-accumulator waveform generator can be used to generate oversampling I and Q directly, with an oversampling clock as high as, say, 50 to 100 times the symbol rate.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0078">It will be appreciated that the oversample clock can be directly connected to the Delta-Sigma oversampling clock, avoiding any current drain or area size increase since no multipliers are required to operate and no loss in the modulation accuracy occurs. It will be understood that such use of the same ovesampling rate serves to spread quantisation noise and lower the noise floor.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0079">It will be appreciated that the Complexity of the Multi-accumulator Waveform Generator is summarized as:

</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0080">The Complexity of the traditional FIR using the fact that the input is constant over a symbol is:

</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0081">Thus, it will be understood that both approaches have the same complexity when the oversampling ratio is equal to the derivative order.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0082">However, for a system like EDGE which requires Low EVM, an oversampling of 16 is required. A 4<sup>th </sup>order derivative meets both the EVM and Spectral Mask, and so a ratio of &#xbc; of the complexity exists when using the multi-accumulator waveform generator approach described above.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0083">Also, when oversampled digital-to-analog converters are used with oversampling clock higher than 40 times the symbol rate, the use of the multi-accumulator waveform generator reduces the complexity significantly.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and system is provided for the preemptive goals based distribution of contact records. This method and system includes devices receiving contact records and providing customer contacts to one or more agents. Interfaced with the device is a distribution module including pools and queues. The distribution module places the contact records into the pools and transfers less than all of the contact records to the queues to allow for processing by the devices at peak efficiency. The distribution module transfers the queues to the devices so that the device can place customer contact attempts. A goal module, associated with the distribution module, monitors the performance of the pools. The goal module modifies which queues the pools transfer contact records to based on the performance of the pools thereby allowing the contact records to be distributed in accordance with performance goals for the pools.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to the field of telephony, computer networks, and customer relationship management, and more particularly to a system and method for preemptive goals based routing of contact records.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Customer contact centers represent the front line for customer service, marketing operations, and debt collection for many businesses. Typical centers receive or make hundreds of telephone calls, emails, and Internet chat requests per day with the aid of automated telephony and Internet equipment. For instance, predictive dialers such as the MOSAIX Predictive Dialing System (&#x201c;PDS&#x201d;) manufactured by Avaya Incorporated automatically dial outbound telephone calls to contact individuals and then transfer the contacted individuals to agents so the agent can talk with the individual.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Devices such as dialing devices, email servers, chat servers, VOIP servers, telephony servers, and web servers allow agents to save time in contacting customers and receiving requests from customers. Dialing devices such as predictive dialers save time for the agent placing the call because the dialing device and not the agent dials the telephone number and agents' time is not wasted with unanswered calls or answering machines. Predictive dialers also spread the outbound telephone calls evenly among all the agents working from the dialing device so that the agents share the workload equally and no agents sit idle while others have too many telephone calls to place. Predictive dialers are also a significant component of customer relationship management (CRM) systems which extend the efficiency gained from predictive dialers to other contact channels such as email and live Internet chat.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many businesses are increasing their marketing efforts, customer service programs, and bad debt collection efforts by having multiple customer contact centers or call centers or multiple devices located at a single site to serve more customers. Typically, when businesses have multiple sites, the centers are located in different geographic locations which makes coordination of customer contact strategies difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus businesses generally manage call centers individually, with separate staffing, calling strategies, goals, and functions. Generally, a contact list is divided into as many parts as there are call centers or dialers with each call center receiving its own section of the calling list. Although this segmentation distributes work, coordination of strategy for outbound calling is difficult since each call center is responsible for its own section of the calling list and has no knowledge of the other call centers' progression with their own calling lists. For instance, if a call center goes down and cannot make outbound telephone calls, the other call centers cannot typically address the downed call center's calling list goals and priorities because the other call centers do not have access to the calling list including the telephone numbers actually called.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A similar problem occurs with a single call center having multiple CRM systems having multiple devices. Work load segmentation typically occurs at a host level, where each device is assigned a portion of the work load. A host downloads the segmented contact list to the individual dialing devices. If one device fails, the other devices do not know the status of the contacts in the failed device's segment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Difficulties also arise in the routing of outbound calls, call records, or contact records to the agents in a single calling center or multiple calling centers. Typically when routing calls, a call center employs categorization and prioritization routing or load leveling routing. With categorization and prioritization routing, the calls are categorized and prioritized before being sent to the call centers. All of the available call records are organized into distinct groups or pools and each pool of call records is prioritized according to a particular prioritizing scheme. A typical scheme often used at contact centers is to prioritize the inbound calls with the highest priority, live Internet chats second, outbound calls third, and email or other requests last. The agents are segregated into distinct teams and each team receives call records from a particular pool based on the prioritization of the call records.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Load leveling routing of call records allows multiple agent teams to work on the same group or pools of records whether the agents are located in the same call center or if the agents are located across multiple call centers. Load leveling routing eliminates the restriction of categorization and prioritization that requires distinct groups of records for agents not working from the same dialing device. This allows for the movement of call records between the agents and call centers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, none of the above call record routing techniques adjusts the agent and pool workload based on the performance or the performance goals of the call record pools. Generally, if a call record pool is not maintaining a desired performance, manual intervention by a system administrator is required to adjust for the under performing call record pool. In order to address the under performing call record pool, agents must move from one team to another in order to have the ability to access call records from the under performing pool and thereby improve the call record pool performance. But this is a slow process that typically results in agent and call center downtime and often cannot be made quickly enough to respond to current call record pool performance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, such manual intervention decisions to correct under performing call records pools typically require guess work and making decisions without considering all the available options and the effect on the other call record pools. The system administrator must guess as to the effects on the other call record pools when agents are moved from pools maintaining or achieving performance requirements to under performing pools. If agent moves are made incorrectly, then additional pools may start under performing due to the agents that were moved to the under performing pool. Therefore the performance of the call record pools requires constant supervision to ensure that by the end of the calling day the performance requirements for the highest priority pools are satisfied.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, a need has arisen for a system and method that distributes contact records based on the performance of the pools of contact records.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A further need has arisen for a system and method that automatically monitors the performance of the pools and automatically adjusts the distribution of contact records based on the performance of the pools.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with the present invention, a system and method for distributing contact records utilizing goals based routing is provided which substantially eliminates or reduces disadvantages and problems associated with previously developed systems and methods for distributing contact records. A goal module monitors the performance of one or more pools of contact records and automatically modifies the distribution of the contact records from the pools based on the performance of each pool.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, distribution of contact records utilizing goals based routing is accomplished by a distribution module interfaced with a plurality of devices. The distribution module includes a plurality of pools and a plurality of queues. The distribution module places contact records into the pools, transfers less than all of the contact records to the queues from the pools, and transfers the queues to the devices. Associated with the distribution module is a goal module. The goal module monitors the performance of each pool and modifies which queues the pools transfer contact records to based upon the performance of the pools.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the goal module defines one or more levels of effort for each queue. The levels of effort determine the percentage of contact records that transfers from a pool to a particular queue. The goal module also determines a goal for each pool that reflects the performance of the pool and prioritizes the pools relative to each other. As the agents access the contact records from the queues, the goal module monitors the performance of the pools by calculating a goal status for each pool. The goal module uses the goal status to determine a goal state for each pool. The goal state indicates whether a pool is satisfying the goal. Based upon the goal states for each pool, the goal module modifies which queues the pools transfer contact records to by transferring the levels of effort between the pools and the queues.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an alternate embodiment, the goal states and one or more goal strategies allow for the optimization of the transfer of contact records from the pools to the queues and determine how the goal module modifies which queues the pools transfer contact records to. The goal strategies control how levels of effort between the pools and queues are transferred when a pool is not satisfying the goal. A goal strategy may require the transfer of levels of effort to pools not satisfying their goals or the transfer of levels of effort away from pools not satisfying the goal. The goal module transfers levels of effort in accordance with the goal strategies so that pools having the highest priority maintain or achieve the goals throughout the day.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention provides a number of important technical advantages. One important technical advantage is the distribution of contact records based on the performance of the pools. The ability to distribute contact records based on the performance of the pools of contact records allows a call center to operate more efficiently because the call center recognizes when a pool is not sufficiently performing and redistributes the contact record workload to allow for more efficient operation thereby allowing higher priority pools to satisfy performance requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another important technical advantage of the present invention is the distribution of contact records based on the performance of the pools without manual intervention. The goal module monitors the performance of each pool and determines whether a pool is ahead, at, or behind the goal. When a pool is not satisfying a goal, the goal module automatically takes action to modify how the pools transfer contact records to so that the highest priority pools achieve or maintain the goals. Therefore, no manual intervention is required and pools are not adversely affected by the changes. In addition, because no manual intervention is required, there is reduced agent or device downtime when the goal module distributes the contact records based upon the performance of the pools.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another important technical advantage of the present invention is the ability to quickly respond to current pool performance levels. Because the goal module constantly monitors the performance of the pools, the goal module may instantly react to any change in the performance of the pools throughout the day. And because the goal module monitors the performance of all the pools and has the goal states for every pool, when the goal module modifies the distribution of contact records, the goal module takes into account the effects of the modification on the goals for all of the pools so that the highest priority pools achieve or maintain the goals. Therefore, the guess work in distributing contact records based on the performance of the pools is reduced and there are no unexpected results at the end of the day.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in the figures, like numeral being used to refer like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Under previous systems and methods for routing contact records, the redistribution of contact records among the devices and agents based upon the performance of the of the different pools of contact records required manual intervention often involving guesswork as to the effects of performance based changes, the shutting down of the devices, starting a new job on the device, or moving agents between the devices. The goal module of the present invention allows for the routing of contact records across one or more than one device based on the performance of the individual pools of contact records quickly and without manual intervention. The goals based routing of contact records allows for dynamically modifying the distribution of contact records based on the performance of the pools of contact records throughout the day without manual intervention, down time, and guesswork.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention allows for the routing and distribution of contact records among a plurality of devices and agents based upon the performance of the different pools of contact records. Contact records include such customer contacts as outbound telephone calls, inbound telephone calls, call records, emails, Internet chat requests, online chat requests, and any other appropriate form of customer contact. Devices include such call center or contact center devices as dialing devices including predictive dialers, email servers, Internet chat servers, VOIP servers, telephony servers, web servers, and any other appropriate call center or contact center devices. In the figures below, reference is made to call records and dialing devices but the present invention equally applies to the other types of contact records and devices listed above.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a block diagram for an outbound distribution system <b>100</b> for distributing outbound telephone calls employing goals based routing. A distribution module <b>102</b> interfaces with a first call center <b>104</b><i>a </i>and a second call center <b>104</b><i>n</i>. System <b>100</b> allows call centers <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>n </i>to operate as a single group of resources rather than two decentralized units, with distribution module <b>102</b> controlling the strategy, workload, and calling efforts for call centers <b>104</b> from a single, central location. In alternative embodiments, distribution module <b>102</b> interfaces with multiple dialing devices at one or more call centers, or one dialing device located in one call center.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Call centers <b>104</b> are geographically distributed, each having one or more dialing devices that place telephone calls using information in the call records. Distribution module <b>102</b> operates on a SOLARIS, Linux, or an any other appropriate operating system server and communicates with call centers <b>104</b> via standardized communications links such as Ethernet, the Internet with protocols such as FTP, CORBA, API, and sockets over TCP/IP, asynchronous transfer mode (&#x201c;ATM&#x201d;), or any other appropriate communication link.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Call centers <b>104</b> each have one or more dialing devices <b>108</b>. Dialing devices <b>108</b> are predictive dialers such as the MOSAIX PDS manufactured by Avaya Incorporated or other appropriate predictive dialers. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, interfaced to dialing device <b>108</b><i>a </i>in call center <b>104</b><i>a </i>are three agents <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>, and <b>110</b><i>c </i>with dialing device <b>108</b><i>n </i>of call center <b>104</b><i>n </i>also having three agents <b>110</b><i>d</i>, <b>110</b><i>e</i>, and <b>110</b><i>f </i>interfaced to it. Agents <b>110</b> are workstations where operators or agents speak to the individuals, chat with individuals online, complete emails to, or otherwise contact individuals who are contacted by dialing devices <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Dialing device <b>108</b> dials telephone numbers extracted from the call records. If an individual answers the telephone, dialing device <b>108</b> transfers the telephone call to one of agents <b>110</b> so that the agent can speak with the individual. Dialing devices <b>108</b> therefore improve telephone calling efficiency by dialing the telephone number and transferring the call to an agent only if an individual answers the telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">System <b>100</b> functions by first having distribution module <b>102</b> acquire the call records that dialing devices <b>108</b> will call. There are several different ways that distribution module <b>102</b> acquires the call records.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For instance, host <b>112</b>, which is associated with dialing devices <b>108</b>, stores raw call records. The raw call records contain information including telephone number, account number, individual name and address, and any other appropriate personal information. For example, a raw call record for Joe Smith includes Joe Smith's telephone number, mailing address, account status, account number, account passwords, gender, marital status, number of children, employment status, and yearly income.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Host <b>112</b> transfers the raw call records for that day along path <b>114</b><i>a </i>to call center <b>104</b><i>a </i>and dialing device <b>108</b><i>a </i>and along path <b>114</b><i>b </i>to call center <b>104</b><i>n </i>and dialing device <b>108</b><i>n</i>. Distribution module <b>102</b> contacts dialing device <b>108</b><i>a </i>within call center <b>104</b><i>a </i>via path <b>116</b><i>a </i>and dialing device <b>108</b><i>n </i>within call center <b>104</b><i>n </i>via path <b>116</b><i>b</i>. Distribution module <b>102</b> downloads from dialing devices <b>108</b> to call record database <b>118</b> the call records. The call records may contain some but not all of the information from the raw call records. Downloading less than all of the information from the raw call records saves bandwidth and allows for efficient operation of distribution module <b>102</b> because it handles smaller amounts of data. For instance, distribution module <b>102</b> downloads as the call record an individual's name, telephone number, and account number. So the call record for Joe Smith contains Joe Smith's name, his telephone number, and account number.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an alternative embodiment, host <b>112</b> stores the raw call records. Instead of transferring the raw call records to dialing devices <b>108</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> downloads the call records from host <b>112</b> to call record database <b>118</b> via path <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Alternatively, dialing devices <b>108</b> store the raw call records. Therefore, distribution module <b>102</b> contacts call center <b>104</b><i>a </i>and dialing device <b>108</b><i>a </i>via path <b>116</b><i>a </i>and call center <b>104</b><i>n </i>and dialing device <b>108</b><i>n </i>via path <b>116</b><i>b </i>to download the call records to call record database <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Scheduling module <b>122</b> operates to develop and provide optimal calling strategies for the call records including resource optimization, automated statistical modeling and flexible strategy management. For instance, one such scheduling module <b>122</b> is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,802,161, entitled &#x201c;Method and System for Optimized Scheduling&#x201d; issued Sep. 1, 1998, and is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The integration of scheduling module <b>122</b> is not required for the operation of distribution module <b>102</b> but it affects how distribution module <b>102</b> downloads the call records and what information is contained in the call records. For instance, host <b>112</b> transfers the raw call records to call center <b>104</b><i>a </i>and dialing device <b>108</b><i>a </i>via path <b>114</b><i>a </i>and call center <b>104</b><i>n </i>and dialing device <b>108</b><i>n </i>via path <b>114</b><i>b</i>. Scheduling module <b>122</b> downloads from dialing device <b>108</b><i>a </i>in call center <b>104</b><i>a </i>via path <b>124</b><i>a </i>and from dialing device <b>108</b><i>n </i>in call center <b>104</b><i>n </i>via path <b>124</b><i>b </i>the raw call records. Scheduling module <b>122</b> develops call schedules for the raw call records. Distribution module <b>102</b> downloads the call records including the call schedule from scheduling module <b>122</b> via path <b>124</b><i>c </i>and stores the call records in call record database <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternative embodiments also employ scheduling module <b>122</b> in the delivery of call records to distribution module <b>102</b>. Scheduling module <b>122</b> downloads the raw call records from host <b>112</b> via path <b>126</b>. As before, scheduling module <b>122</b> adds call schedules to the raw call records before distribution module <b>102</b> downloads the call records from scheduling module <b>122</b> via path <b>124</b><i>c </i>to call record database <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Once distribution module <b>102</b> stores the call records in call record database <b>118</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> organizes and transfers the call records from call record database <b>118</b> to pools <b>128</b>, which are interfaced with distribution module <b>102</b>. The pools are sets of callable call records specified by distribution module <b>102</b>. Each pool <b>128</b> represents a specific and ordered group of call records. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there are three pools <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b</i>, and <b>128</b><i>c</i>. In alternative embodiments there can be more than three or less than three pools.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Distribution module <b>102</b> then transfers less than all of the call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b>. Interfaced with pools <b>128</b> are queues <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b</i>, <b>130</b><i>c</i>, and <b>130</b><i>d</i>. A queue is a set of rules for selecting call records from pools having the necessary and sufficient information describing the exact method of transferring call records to dialing devices <b>108</b> and any call records assigned to but not yet transferred to dialing devices <b>108</b> for dialing devices <b>108</b> to call. Distribution module <b>102</b> attaches each queue <b>130</b> to a particular dialing device <b>108</b> and monitors each dialing device. As necessary, distribution module <b>102</b> transfers call records from pools <b>128</b> in accordance with the configuration of queues <b>130</b> which includes selection rules, time of day, time of week, number of calls completed, and number of call records sent. Queues <b>130</b> then transfer the call records to their assigned dialing devices <b>108</b>. For instance, distribution module <b>102</b> transfers call records according to the configuration of queues <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>to dialing device <b>108</b><i>a </i>of call center <b>104</b><i>a </i>and according to the configuration of queues <b>130</b><i>c </i>and <b>130</b><i>d </i>to dialing device <b>108</b><i>n </i>of call center <b>104</b><i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, each queue <b>130</b> is associated with a single campaign for the dialing device to which it is assigned. A campaign is an outbound job calling on dialing device <b>108</b> that can receive additional call records for calling while the outbound calling job is active. Normally, a campaign on dialing device <b>108</b> continues to run until manually stopped or when it runs out of call records to dial.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Pools <b>128</b> can satisfy transfer requests for call records for one or more than one queue <b>130</b>. For example, pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>transfers call records to queue <b>130</b><i>a</i>, pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>transfers call records to queues <b>130</b><i>b </i>and <b>130</b><i>c</i>, and pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>transfers call records to queue <b>130</b><i>d</i>. In addition, distribution module <b>102</b> can change the queues which request call records from pools <b>128</b> throughout the day and in the middle of outbound calling campaigns. For instance, if dialing device <b>108</b><i>n </i>located in call center <b>104</b><i>n </i>calls all the call records in pool <b>128</b><i>c</i>, then distribution module <b>102</b> can request that pools <b>128</b><i>a </i>and <b>128</b><i>b </i>transfer call records to queue <b>130</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Distribution module <b>102</b> transfers the call records to pools <b>128</b>, transfers less than all of the call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b>, and transfers queues <b>130</b> to dialing devices <b>108</b> before dialing devices <b>108</b> begin their daily calling routines. At the beginning of the day, distribution module <b>102</b> transfers enough call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> to allow for dialing devices <b>108</b> to place calls for fifteen, thirty, sixty minutes, or an appropriate amount of time to place calls. Distribution module <b>102</b> monitors the calls placed by dialing devices <b>108</b> as well as the number of call records remaining to be called to determine how busy dialing devices <b>108</b> are and when and how many additional call records to transfer from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b>. The monitoring of queues <b>130</b> and the transferring of additional call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> allows for real-time movement of call records from distribution module <b>102</b> to dialing devices <b>108</b> throughout the day. For instance, as soon as dialing device <b>108</b><i>a </i>is about to finish calling the call records in the campaign assigned to queue <b>130</b><i>a</i>, distribution module <b>102</b> transfers additional call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>to queue <b>130</b><i>a </i>so that dialing device <b>108</b><i>a </i>maintains a steady and level flow of work.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Dialing devices <b>108</b> also track the call attempt results of every call placed by dialing devices <b>108</b>. The call attempt results include whether or not a call resulted in a right party contact, a wrong party contact, no answer, or an answering machine. For example, the objective of a call record for Joe Smith is to talk with Joe Smith. If agent <b>110</b> speaks with Joe Smith, that is a right party contact and a successful call attempt result. If Joe's babysitter answers the phone and Joe is not home, that is a wrong party contact and an unsuccessful call attempt result. If no one answers the phone or an answering machine answers the phone, that is an unsuccessful call attempt result since the desired party was not contacted. Therefore throughout the day, distribution module <b>102</b> queries dialing devices <b>108</b> for call attempt results and uploads the call attempts results. If a call attempt result is unsuccessful, then distribution module <b>102</b> updates the call record in pools <b>128</b> so that a dialing device <b>108</b> may call the call record again at a later time in the day.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An advantage to system <b>100</b> is that distribution module <b>102</b> controls the transfer of the call records which results in a level work flow for dialing devices <b>108</b>. To enable better work flow control, queues <b>130</b> include selection rules that determine how distribution module <b>102</b> transfers call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b>. The selection rules allow for the optimization of the transfer of call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> and include priority rules, percentage rules, quotas, queuing theory rules, or any other appropriate rules for optimizing the transfer of call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b>. The selection rules can be modified on an as needed basis.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Priority rules result in distribution module <b>102</b> transferring call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> based upon an assigned priority for each pool <b>128</b>. For example, queue <b>130</b><i>a </i>receives call records from pools <b>128</b><i>a </i>and <b>128</b><i>b </i>with pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>having priority over pool <b>128</b><i>b</i>. Queue <b>130</b><i>b </i>receives call records from pools <b>128</b><i>a </i>and <b>128</b><i>b </i>with pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>having priority over pool <b>128</b><i>a</i>. Assume that pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>arrives at 8:00 AM while pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>arrives at 9:00 AM. Initially, both queues <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>receive call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a</i>. At 9:00 AM when pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>arrives, queue <b>130</b><i>a </i>continues to receive call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>while queue <b>130</b><i>b </i>receives call records from pool <b>128</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Percentage rules result in distribution module <b>102</b> simultaneously transferring call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b>. For example, queue <b>130</b><i>c </i>has a percentage configuration with pools <b>128</b><i>b </i>and <b>128</b><i>c </i>and queue <b>130</b><i>d </i>has a percentage configuration with pools <b>128</b><i>b </i>and <b>128</b><i>c</i>. In this configuration, queue <b>130</b><i>c </i>and <b>130</b><i>d </i>receive call records simultaneously from pools <b>128</b><i>b </i>and <b>128</b><i>c</i>. With pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>arriving at 8:00 AM and pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>arriving at 9:00 AM, at 8:00 AM both queues <b>130</b><i>c </i>and <b>130</b><i>d </i>receive call records from pool <b>128</b><i>b</i>. At 9:00 AM, queues <b>130</b><i>c </i>and <b>130</b><i>d </i>alternatively receive call records from pools <b>128</b><i>b </i>and <b>128</b><i>c</i>. The percentages are variable for instance so that queue <b>130</b><i>c </i>receives 80% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>and 20% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>while queue <b>130</b><i>d </i>receives 60% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>and 40% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The selection rules can also incorporate the execution of an optimization module which will determine the optimal mix of call records from each of the available pools <b>128</b> based on the optimization constraints and the number of call records needed at the current time.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The selection rules can also incorporate pool quotas which are limits set on each pool controlling a maximum activity level such as number of records transferred, number of successful call attempts, and other appropriate indicators of call record activity. When distribution module <b>102</b> transfers call records to pools <b>128</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> can also set quotas on how many call records dialing devices <b>108</b> will call from pools <b>128</b>. In the percentage rule example above, distribution module <b>102</b> can place a quota on pool <b>128</b><i>b</i>. When dialing devices <b>108</b> satisfy the quota for pool <b>128</b><i>b</i>, queues <b>130</b><i>c </i>and <b>130</b><i>d </i>no longer receive call records from pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>and only receive call records from pool <b>128</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The selection rules can also be a combination of the percentage rules and the priority rules. For example, queue <b>130</b><i>b </i>receives call records from all three pools <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b</i>, and <b>128</b><i>c</i>. Queue <b>130</b><i>b </i>receives call records from pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>until dialing device <b>108</b><i>a </i>calls all the call records in pool <b>128</b><i>b</i>. At that time, queue <b>130</b><i>b </i>then alternately receives call records from pools <b>128</b><i>a </i>and <b>128</b><i>c</i>. As with the percentage rules above, queue <b>130</b><i>b </i>can receive call records from pools <b>128</b><i>a </i>and <b>128</b><i>c </i>in any percentage breakdown. Therefore, pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>has priority over pools <b>128</b><i>a </i>and <b>128</b><i>c </i>while pools <b>128</b><i>a </i>and <b>128</b><i>c </i>transfer call records using percentage rules.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, these selection rules allow for skills-based routing between pools <b>128</b>. For example, distribution module <b>102</b> allows pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>to initially transfer call records to queue <b>130</b><i>a </i>and pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>to initially transfer call records to queue <b>130</b><i>d</i>. If pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>becomes depleted and has no more call records to transfer to queue <b>130</b><i>d</i>, then pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>can begin transferring call records to both queues <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>d</i>. This allows distribution module <b>102</b> to transfer call records for easy to moderate difficulty customers to the best agents while the less skilled agents work the more difficult customers. And once the easy to moderate difficulty customers call records are depleted, the best agents can begin working the more difficult customer call records.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, distribution module <b>102</b> may also route call records to dialing devices <b>108</b> and agents <b>110</b> based on the performance of pools <b>128</b>. Routing the call records based on the performance of pools <b>128</b> allows distribution module <b>102</b> to make modifications so that pools <b>128</b> having a higher priority are not under-performing. Goal module <b>103</b>, associated with distribution module <b>102</b> and pools <b>128</b>, monitors the performance of pools <b>128</b>. To monitor the performance of pools <b>128</b>, either a user of system <b>100</b> or goal module <b>103</b> defines a performance metric for each pool <b>128</b>. Once the performance metric is defined, goal module <b>103</b> applies the performance metric to pools <b>128</b>. The performance metric is what goal module <b>103</b> uses to measure the performance of pools <b>128</b>. For example, the performance metric for pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>may be the number of right party contacts while the performance metric for pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>is the number of accounts attempts and the performance metric for pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>is the number of call records attempted. Each pool <b>128</b> may have a different performance metric or pools <b>128</b> may have the same performance metric. In addition, each of the pools <b>128</b> may have more than one performance metric. For instance, pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>may have both a performance metric for the number of right party contacts and for the number of total accounts attempted.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Once goal module <b>103</b> has determined a performance metric for each pool <b>128</b>, goal module <b>103</b> defines a goal for each pool <b>128</b>. The goal can be either an absolute goal or a goal set relative to all the other pools <b>128</b>. An absolute goal is a goal tied solely to the performance of the particular pool <b>128</b> while a relative goal is tied to the performance of all pools <b>128</b>. In addition, the goal is related to the selected performance metric. For instance, pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>having a performance metric of number of right party contacts may have a goal of fifty right party contacts while pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>having a performance metric of number of call records attempted has a goal of one hundred call records attempted.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">If a pool <b>128</b> has more than one performance metric, then the pool <b>128</b> will have a goal for each performance metric. For example, if pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>has a performance metric for number of right party contacts and for total number of accounts attempted, pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>may have a goal of 80 right party contacts and 200 accounts attempted. In addition, a pool <b>128</b> may also have a combination of goals where there pool <b>128</b> only needs to satisfy one of the goals. For instance, pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>may have a goal of 75 right party contacts or 200 accounts attempted and as long as pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>has at least 75 right party contacts or 200 accounts attempted, pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>is considered to be satisfying its goal and experiencing satisfactory performance.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The goals may also be end of day goals, mid-day goals, and rate based goals. End of day goals are goals calculated based on the performance of a pool <b>128</b> at the end of the day and include such goals as total number of call records attempted and number of right party contacts. Mid-day goals are similar to end of day goals but are calculated based on the time of day. For example, pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>may have a mid-day goal of twenty-five right party contacts by noon. Rate based goals are calculated as a rate of the total calls. For instance, if pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>has a performance metric of right party contact rate, a rate based goal may be 15% of all the call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>should result in a right party contact.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Similar to the selection rules, goal module <b>103</b> defines or constrains levels of effort for each queue <b>130</b>. The levels of effort detail the percentage of call records that transfer from a particular pool <b>128</b> to a particular queue <b>130</b>. The levels of effort are stored in an effort map associated with goal module <b>103</b>. Table 1 shows an example effort map for system <b>100</b>. An examination of the effort map shown in Table 1 reveals that queue <b>1</b> (queue <b>130</b><i>a</i>) has a level of effort of 100% to pool <b>1</b> (pool <b>128</b><i>a</i>) meaning queue <b>130</b><i>a </i>receives all of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a</i>. Queue <b>2</b> (queue <b>130</b><i>b</i>) has a level of effort of 100% to pool <b>2</b> (pool <b>128</b><i>b</i>) meaning queue <b>130</b><i>b </i>receives 100% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>b</i>. Queue <b>3</b> (queue <b>130</b><i>c</i>) has a level of effort of 100% to pool <b>2</b> (pool <b>128</b><i>b</i>) meaning queue <b>130</b><i>c </i>receives 100% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>b</i>. Queue <b>4</b> (queue <b>130</b><i>d</i>) has a level of effort of 100% to pool <b>3</b> (pool <b>128</b><i>c</i>) meaning that queue <b>130</b><i>d </i>receives 100% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>c</i>. Therefore, 100% of the call records in pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>transfer to queue <b>130</b><i>a</i>, the call records in pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>transfer equally to queues <b>130</b><i>b </i>and <b>130</b><i>c</i>, and 100% of the call records in pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>transfer to queue <b>130</b><i>d</i>.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As pools <b>128</b> begin to transfer call records to queues <b>130</b> and agents <b>110</b> access the call records, goal module <b>103</b> calculates a goal status for each pool <b>128</b>. The goal status can be defined as either the absolute difference between the actual metric and the goal or the percentage that a pool <b>128</b> is either ahead or behind its goal. For instance, if each pool <b>128</b> has a goal of fifty right party contacts and pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>has forty-five right party contacts, pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>has forty-eight right party contracts, and pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>has sixty right party contacts, then pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>has a goal status of &#x2212;10%, pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>has a goal status of &#x2212;4%, and pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>has a goal status of +20% for percentage based goals. Pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>has a goal status of &#x2212;5, pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>has a goal status of &#x2212;2 and pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>has a goal status of +10 for absolute difference based goals.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Goal module <b>103</b> uses the goal status for each pool <b>128</b> to determine a goal state for each pool <b>128</b>. Pools <b>128</b> will have a goal state for each goal. An example definition of goals states would include the designation of ahead of goal, at goal, or behind goal. Goal module <b>103</b> or a user of system of <b>100</b> determines what thresholds define each of the available goal states. For example, if the goal states have been defined as ahead of goal, at goal, or behind goal, then a goal status of +10% and above may be ahead of goal, a goal status between +10% and &#x2212;5% may be at goal, and a goal status of &#x2212;5% and below may be behind goal. Given these threshold percentages and the goal status for pools <b>128</b>, pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>has a goal state of behind goal (&#x2212;10%), pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>has a goal state of at goal (&#x2212;4%), and pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>has a goal state of ahead of goal (+20%). Any pool <b>128</b> that has a goal state of behind goal is said to be an under-performing pool and therefore experience unsatisfactory performance.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Similar to the pool quotas described above, goal module <b>103</b> also identifies and defines a final goal for each pool <b>128</b>. A user of system <b>100</b> may also define the final goals for each of the pools <b>128</b>. When a pool <b>128</b> satisfies its final goal, that pool <b>128</b> is no longer active and all the queues <b>130</b> that were receiving call records from that pool <b>128</b> now receive call records from the other pools <b>128</b> that have not satisfied their final goals. For instance, pool <b>128</b><i>a</i>&#x2013;<b>128</b><i>c </i>each have a final goal of eighty right party contacts. At 3:00 PM, pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>achieves eighty right party contacts. Because pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>has achieved its final goal, it becomes inactive and the call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>are no longer transferred to queue <b>130</b><i>a</i>. To prevent queue <b>130</b><i>a </i>and agents <b>110</b> who access call records from queue <b>130</b><i>a </i>from becoming inactive, goal module <b>103</b> modifies which queues <b>130</b> pools <b>128</b><i>b </i>and <b>128</b><i>c </i>transfer call records to by allowing pools <b>128</b><i>b </i>and <b>128</b><i>c </i>to transfer call records to queue <b>130</b><i>a</i>. Since pools <b>128</b><i>b </i>and <b>128</b><i>c </i>have not reached their final goals, they are still active and queues <b>130</b> and agents <b>110</b> who were receiving call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>now receive call records from pools <b>128</b><i>b </i>and <b>128</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Before distribution module <b>102</b> begins to transfer queues <b>130</b> containing the call records to dialing devices <b>108</b>, goal module <b>103</b> prioritizes pools <b>128</b> relative to each other. Certain pools <b>128</b> may contain call records that are of a higher priority than other pools <b>128</b>. For example, pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>may contain call records for customers who have previously purchased products, pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>may contain call records for customers who have never purchased products, and pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>may contain call records for customers who are delinquent in paying for products previously purchased. Since a company's highest priority may be to collect the money it is owed, goal module <b>103</b> rates pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>with the highest priority while pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>has the second highest priority since it contains call records for customers with whom there is a previous relationship. Pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>has the lowest priority since it contains call records for potential customers. The prioritization of pools <b>128</b> enables goal module <b>103</b> to adjust the workload of agents <b>110</b> so that pools <b>128</b> having the highest priority achieve and maintain their goals throughout the day.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Goal module <b>103</b> modifies the distribution of call records using the goals of pools <b>128</b> by modifying which queues <b>130</b> pools <b>128</b> transfer call records to based on the performance and prioritization of pools <b>128</b>. Goal module <b>103</b> modifies which queues <b>130</b> pools <b>128</b> transfer call records to by adjusting or transferring the levels of effort between pools <b>128</b> and queues <b>130</b>. For example, pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is of a higher priority than pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>and pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is behind goal. Using the effort map shown in Table 1, queue <b>130</b><i>a </i>receives 100% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>and queue <b>130</b><i>d </i>receives 100% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>c</i>. Since pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is of a higher priority, goal module <b>103</b> transfers level of effort from pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>to pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>so that queue <b>130</b><i>d </i>receives 50% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>and 50% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>while queue <b>130</b><i>a </i>still receives 100% of its call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a</i>. The example effort map shown in Table 2 illustrates which queues <b>130</b> pools <b>128</b> supply call records to after goal module <b>103</b> modifies the distribution of call records. Transferring some of the level of effort from pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>to pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>allows agents <b>110</b> who work queue <b>130</b><i>d </i>to work call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>and thereby increase the number of agents <b>110</b> accessing call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>so that pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>may satisfy its goal.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">To aid in the distribution of call records based on the performance of pools <b>128</b>, goal module <b>103</b> employs one or more goal strategies. The goal strategies allow for the optimization of the transfer of call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> and help to determine how goal module <b>103</b> transfers the levels of effort between pools <b>128</b> and queues <b>130</b>. There are different goal strategies that goal module <b>103</b> may implement when distributing the call records based on the performance of pools <b>128</b>. Goal module <b>103</b> may automatically select the goal strategy based upon the call records or a user of system of <b>100</b> may select an appropriate goal strategy.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">One goal strategy is a meet-goals strategy. With the meet-goals strategy, goal module <b>103</b> transfers levels of effort to pools <b>128</b> that are not meeting their goals (a goal state of behind goal) and therefore are experiencing unsatisfactory performance. For example, if pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is behind goal and pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>is ahead of goal, goal module <b>103</b> transfers levels of effort from pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>to pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>so that queues <b>130</b><i>b </i>and <b>130</b><i>c </i>also receive call records from pool <b>128</b><i>a</i>. A number of right party contacts performance metric is a performance metric that might be managed with the meet-goals goal strategy.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Another goal strategy is an exceed-goals strategy. With the exceed-goals strategy, goal module <b>103</b> transfers levels of effort away from pools <b>128</b> that are not meeting their goals (a goal state of behind goal) and therefore have unsatisfactory performance. For instance, if pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>is behind goal and pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>is at goal, goal module <b>103</b> transfers levels of effort from pool <b>128</b><i>b </i>to pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>so that queues <b>130</b><i>b </i>and <b>130</b><i>c </i>begin to receive call records from pool <b>128</b><i>c</i>. A right party contact rate performance metric is a performance metric that might be managed using the exceed-goals goal strategy.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">To insure that lower priority pools <b>128</b> do not become neglected when goal module <b>103</b> routes call records based on the performance of pools <b>128</b>, goal module <b>103</b> sets preemptive limits on how much level of effort may be transferred away from pools <b>128</b>. These preemptive limits are stored in routing tables of which each pool <b>128</b> has its own routing table stored in goal module <b>103</b>. An exemplary routing table for pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is shown in Table 3. In the example routing table of Table 3, if pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is ahead of goal, then pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is willing to forego 75% of its total level of effort to pools <b>128</b> that are at a higher priority that need additional levels of effort. Pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is willing to forego 50% of its total level of effort to pools <b>128</b> that are at the same priority that need effort if pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is ahead of goal. Pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is willing to give up 25% of its total level of effort to pools <b>128</b> that are of lower priority if needed if pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is ahead of goal. The percentages are then set at 40%, 25% and 15% if pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is currently at goal. If pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is behind goal, pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>will only give up 25% of its level of effort and only to a pool <b>128</b> of higher priority. Each pool <b>128</b> has its own routing table and the percentages may vary depending on the number of pools, the number of call records, or any other appropriate factors.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In an alternate embodiment, the goal states and one or more goal strategies are inputs to and determine the objective functions and the constraints for an optimized solution to the routing determination problem. The goal strategies control how constraints on the levels of effort between pools <b>128</b> and queues <b>130</b> are relaxed or tightened when a pool <b>128</b> is not satisfying the goal. A goal strategy may allow for the transfer of higher levels of effort to pools <b>128</b> not satisfying their goals or allow for the transfer of higher levels of effort away from pools <b>128</b> not satisfying the goal. The goal module adjusts the level of effort constraints in accordance with the goal strategies so that pools <b>128</b> having the highest priority maintain or achieve the goals throughout the day.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In case of a communication, dialing device, or call center outage, system <b>100</b> employs contingency modules <b>132</b> for each dialing device <b>108</b>. Contingency modules <b>132</b> are associated with dialing devices <b>108</b>. Contingency modules <b>132</b> secure the call records within their respective dialing devices <b>108</b> in case of an outage. Before distribution module <b>102</b> transfers the call records to pools <b>128</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> creates call record accounts for dialing devices <b>108</b>, locks the call record accounts to dialing devices <b>108</b>, creates a contingency download file, and stores the contingency download file in contingency modules <b>132</b>. Distribution module <b>102</b> updates the contingency download file with call attempt results which prevents dialing devices <b>108</b> from calling call records already successfully called.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Users of system <b>100</b> control the functionality of distribution module <b>102</b> and goal module <b>103</b> through a user interface. The user interface is shown as online interface <b>134</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> but can be any appropriate type of user interface. Online interface <b>134</b> is a graphical user, platform-independent, password-protected World Wide Web (&#x201c;WWW&#x201d;) browser-based interface. Users use online interface <b>134</b> to control the settings for distribution module <b>102</b> including goal module <b>103</b> including application of the selection rules, number of pools, and number of call records to initially transfer to the queues, generate reports, select goal strategies, select performance metrics, select the goals for the pools, define the goal states, modify the effort map and routing tables, and create and modify enterprise parameters. Users access online interface <b>134</b> by using browser <b>136</b> to access Internet <b>138</b> to reach a specific web address.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Although the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> contains more than one dialing device, in alternative embodiments distribution module <b>102</b> interfaces with a single dialing device. A single dialing device interfacing with distribution module <b>102</b> allows for variable control over similar lists of call records. For instance, call records may be divided into geographies such as states or time zones. Calling can be stopped automatically by distribution module <b>102</b> when a quota is reached for a particular geography. Distribution module <b>102</b> presents the similar lists of call records for different geographies as different pools but the similar lists of call records for different geographies would represent one calling job within the single dialing device.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a block diagram of system <b>150</b> employing two distribution modules in an alternative embodiment of the present invention. System <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is shown with less detail than in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">System <b>150</b> employs two distribution modules <b>102</b> and <b>152</b>. Distribution module <b>152</b> is associated with two call centers <b>154</b> and <b>156</b>. Call centers <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> each have one dialing device <b>158</b>. Distribution module <b>152</b> provides the same functionality to call centers <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> that distribution module <b>102</b> provides to call centers <b>104</b> as described above in the discussion regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Distribution module <b>152</b> provides redundancy and prevents distribution module <b>102</b> from being overburdened by too many dialing devices. Distribution module <b>102</b> functions effectively with more than one dialing device interfaced with it but performance and efficiency suffers when too many dialing devices are attached. Therefore, additional distribution module <b>152</b> allows for both it and distribution module <b>102</b> to achieve optimal performance and efficiency when adding additional call centers <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> with additional dialing devices <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In system <b>150</b>, distribution modules <b>102</b> and <b>152</b> are in communication with each other including communicating which call records are in the pools and the call attempt results. Distribution modules <b>102</b> and <b>152</b> transfer call records and call attempt results between themselves just as distribution module <b>102</b> transfers call records and call attempt results between dialing devices <b>108</b>. Therefore, if dialing devices <b>158</b> are idle while dialing devices <b>108</b> are overburdened, distribution module <b>102</b> transfers call records to distribution module <b>152</b> for dialing devices <b>158</b> to call. In addition, if distribution module <b>152</b> experiences an outage, distribution module <b>102</b> transfers the high priority calls from distribution module <b>152</b> to dialing devices <b>108</b> without worry of calling the same call record a second time in the same day when the first call resulted in a right party contact.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The two distribution modules <b>102</b> and <b>152</b> of system <b>150</b> also each include a goal module <b>103</b> and <b>153</b>. Goal module <b>153</b> provides the same functionality to call centers <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> that goal module <b>103</b> provides to call centers <b>104</b> as described above in the discussion regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Goal modules <b>103</b> and <b>153</b> are in communication with each other including communicating the performance of their respective pools and queues. Through the use of distribution modules <b>102</b> and <b>152</b>, goal modules <b>103</b> and <b>153</b> can transfer levels of effort between their respective pools just as goal module <b>103</b> transfers levels of effort between pools <b>128</b>. Therefore if high priority pools <b>128</b> are not meeting their goals, then goal module <b>153</b> can transfer levels of effort from distribution module <b>152</b> so that the high priority pools <b>128</b> will achieve their goals.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a flow diagram depicts a process for distributing outbound call records. The process begins at step <b>170</b> with the transfer of call records from host <b>112</b>, dialing devices <b>108</b>, or scheduling module <b>122</b> to distribution module <b>102</b>. In step <b>172</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> organizes and arranges the call records into pools <b>128</b>. Based upon user inputs distribution module <b>102</b> assigns queues <b>130</b> to specific dialing devices in step <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In step <b>176</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> checks to see if the selection rules are to be applied to pools <b>128</b> and queues <b>130</b>. If the selection rules are not to be applied, then the process continues in step <b>178</b>. If selection rules are to be applied, then in step <b>180</b> distribution module <b>102</b> determines if priority, percentage, or quota rules are applied to pools <b>128</b>. If priority rules are applied, then in step <b>182</b> distribution module <b>102</b> applies the priority rules to pools <b>128</b> and queues <b>130</b> and the process continues on to step <b>178</b>. If percentage rules are applied, then in step <b>184</b> distribution module <b>102</b> applies the percentage rules to pools <b>128</b> and queues <b>130</b> and the process continues in step <b>178</b>. If the quota rules are applied, then in step <b>186</b> distribution module <b>102</b> applies the quotas to pools <b>128</b> and queues <b>130</b> and the process continues to step <b>178</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Distribution module <b>102</b> then delivers enough call records to queues <b>130</b> for dialing devices <b>108</b> to place telephone calls for fifteen, thirty, sixty minutes, or an appropriate amount of time to place calls in step <b>178</b>. In step <b>190</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> locks the call records assigned to dialing devices <b>108</b> and creates a contingency file specific for each dialing device <b>108</b> in step <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In step <b>194</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> transfers queues <b>130</b> containing the set number of call records to dialing devices <b>108</b>. Periodically, distribution module <b>102</b> uploads call record statistics from each queue <b>130</b> in step <b>196</b>. Distribution module <b>102</b> may upload the call record statistics from queues <b>130</b> every few seconds, every few minutes, every hour, or any other appropriate interval of time. Call record statistics include such information as how many call records remain to be called and the rate at which dialing devices <b>108</b> are depleting the call records in queues <b>130</b>. In addition to uploading call record statistics, in step <b>198</b> distribution module <b>102</b> also uploads call attempt results. Call attempt results include whether a right party contact or wrong party contact was made or whether an answering machine was reached when dialing devices <b>108</b> place a telephone call.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In step <b>202</b> distribution module <b>102</b> updates the contingency file with the call attempt results specific for dialing devices <b>108</b>. In step <b>204</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> uses the call record statistics gathered in step <b>196</b> to analyze the number of call records remaining to be called and the depletion rate of the call records within queues <b>130</b>. Based upon the call attempt results, distribution module <b>102</b> re-presents to pools <b>128</b> call records where the first attempt to make a right party contact was unsuccessful so that the call record can be called later in the day in step <b>206</b>. In addition, the call record can be made unavailable for the remainder of the day if a right party contact was made.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Based upon the call record statistics, distribution module <b>102</b> determines in step <b>208</b> if more call records need to be sent from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b>. If more call records are needed, then in step <b>210</b> distribution module <b>102</b> sends additional call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> and the process repeats beginning with step <b>176</b> until manually stopped. But if distribution module <b>102</b> determines that no additional call records need to be sent from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> in step <b>208</b>, then the process repeats beginning with step <b>196</b> until manually stopped or until there are no call records remaining to be called.</p>

In step <b>224</b>, scheduling module <b>122</b> transfers the call records containing call scheduling information to call record database <b>118</b> within distribution module <b>102</b>. Distribution module <b>102</b> then arranges the call records into pools <b>128</b> in step <b>226</b>. When distribution module <b>102</b> places the call records into pools <b>128</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> examines each call record to determine how to extract the scheduling information, account number and telephone number from the call record. In addition, distribution module <b>102</b> flags any call records where the scheduling information or telephone number is stripped from the end of the call record before placing it in the pools <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In step <b>228</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> splits the call records into a plurality of pools <b>128</b>. Each pool <b>128</b> holds the call record as a data string and the call records are in the same format within pools <b>128</b>. In addition, distribution module <b>102</b> arranges the call records within pools <b>128</b> so that each call record is selectable by its account number.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The call scheduling information provided by scheduling module <b>122</b> allows for an optimum order to call the call records. Using the call scheduling information, distribution module <b>102</b> creates hourly indices for pools <b>128</b> in step <b>230</b>. The hourly indices allow for pools <b>128</b> to take advantage of the fact that the call order and call priority of each call record changes based upon the time of day. For example, a call record might be scheduled to be the first call at 8:00 AM and if not successfully called at 8:00 AM then rescheduled to be the tenth call made at 6:00 PM. There is a hourly index created for each hour of the calling day and the hourly indices are shown in step <b>232</b>. Distribution module <b>102</b> creates an index for each hour for each pool <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In addition to the hourly indices, distribution module <b>102</b> also creates an immediate index and an overflow index. The immediate index contains call records that are always the first to be called at the beginning of every hourly index. The call records within the immediate index allow real time call record insertion based upon previous call attempts and are often call records that resulted in no contact when called the first time. Call records contained in the overflow index are call records which were not scheduled to be called or call records that do not have call scheduling information.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Once the call records are arranged into pools <b>128</b> and the hourly indices are created, the process of transferring the call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> begins. In step <b>234</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> selects the call records contained in the immediate index. Distribution module <b>102</b> also removes any call records that are unavailable to be called and marks the call records as unavailable in step <b>236</b>. In step <b>238</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> determines if it is ready to transfer the call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> for this hour and if there are a sufficient number of call records to be transferred from the immediate index to allow for fifteen, thirty, sixty minutes, or an appropriate amount of time for calling. If there are sufficient call records, then in step <b>239</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> transfers the call records from the pool immediate index to queues <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">If there are not enough call records in the immediate index, then in step <b>240</b> distribution module <b>102</b> selects call records from the appropriate hourly index. These additional call records in combination with call records from the immediate index will allow for fifteen, thirty, sixty minutes, or an appropriate amount of time for calling. In step <b>242</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> removes any call records unavailable to be called and marks the call records as unavailable. Distribution module <b>102</b> then transfers the call records from the immediate index and the appropriate hourly index to queues <b>130</b> in step <b>239</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In step <b>244</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> transfers queues <b>130</b> containing the call records to dialing devices <b>108</b>. After queues <b>130</b> are transferred to dialing devices <b>108</b>, in step <b>246</b> dialing devices <b>108</b> begin calling the call records.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, as dialing devices <b>108</b> call the call records, distribution module <b>102</b> monitors dialing devices <b>108</b> and queues <b>130</b> for when it is time to send the next hourly index of call records from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> in step <b>248</b>. In determining when to send the next hourly index, distribution module <b>102</b> cannot start morning hour queues before the actual hour of the hourly index and must stop evening hour queues before the hourly index hour expires. For instance, the pool morning hourly index for 10:00 AM cannot be sent from pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> before 10:00 AM and the evening hourly index for 7:00 PM must stop calling at 8:00 PM. This is in part to due to telemarketing regulations that regulate the times of day that telemarketing calls may be placed.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">If in step <b>248</b> it is time for the next hourly index, then in step <b>250</b> distribution module <b>102</b> selects the next hourly index to be called and begins the process of transferring the call records from the appropriate hourly index to queues <b>130</b>. The process of selecting the next hourly index repeats steps <b>234</b> through <b>244</b> by first taking call records from the immediate index and adding call records from the appropriate hourly index as explained above.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">If in step <b>248</b> it is not time for the next hour, then distribution module <b>102</b> determines queue depth and the time to go in step <b>252</b>. Queue depth is the amount of call records remaining to be called in the queue while time to go is the amount of time remaining in the hour for the hourly index. In step <b>254</b> if the depth is not too low and the time to go is not too short so that there are a sufficient amount of call records to call for the remaining time left in the hour, then additional call records are not needed in queue <b>130</b>. So in step <b>256</b>, the call attempt results regarding a right or wrong party contact are uploaded from dialing devices <b>108</b> and sent back to distribution module <b>102</b> in step <b>258</b>. The process then returns to step <b>234</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>to begin the next record search.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">If in step <b>254</b> distribution module <b>102</b> determines that the depth is too low or the time to go is too short, then in step <b>260</b> distribution module <b>102</b> calculates the number of call records needed to finish out the hour for the hourly index. In step <b>262</b>, distribution module <b>102</b> selects additional call records to call by repeating steps <b>234</b> through <b>239</b> above and transferring the call records from the pools <b>128</b> to queues <b>130</b> in step <b>264</b> so that dialing devices <b>108</b> do not sit idle but finish out the hour placing telephone calls. The process then returns to step <b>234</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>to begin the next record search.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a flow diagram of a method for goals based routing of contact records employing a meet-goals goal strategy. The method begins at step <b>300</b> when goal module <b>103</b> selects a performance metric for each pool <b>128</b>, determines a goal for each pool <b>128</b> and prioritizes pools <b>128</b> relative to each other. At step <b>302</b> goals module <b>103</b> calculates a goal status for each pool <b>128</b> using the goal and performance metric for each pool <b>128</b>. After goal module <b>103</b> has calculated a goal status, goal module <b>103</b> cycles through pools <b>128</b> in descending priority order at step <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">At step <b>306</b>, goal module <b>103</b> selects a target pool based on its priority. Goal module <b>103</b> selects a target pool by first selecting the pool <b>128</b> having the highest priority. Goal module <b>103</b> then determines the goal state from the goal status for the target pool to determine if the target pool is behind goal at step <b>308</b>. If the target pool is not behind goal, then at step <b>310</b> goal module <b>103</b> checks to see if there are additional pools <b>128</b> to cycle through. If there are not additional pools <b>128</b> to cycle through, then the process ends. But if there are additional pools <b>128</b> to cycle through at step <b>310</b>, then the process returns to step <b>306</b> where goal module <b>103</b> selects the pool <b>128</b> having the next highest priority to determine if that target pool is behind goal. If that target pool is not behind goal, then the process repeats until either goal module <b>103</b> locates a target pool that is behind goal at step <b>308</b> or the process ends because no target pools are behind goal.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">If at step <b>308</b>, the target pool is behind goal, then goal module <b>103</b> cycles through donor pools from lowest to highest priority at step <b>312</b>. The donor pools include all the other pools <b>128</b> except the target pool that was selected at step <b>308</b>. At step <b>314</b>, goal module <b>103</b> selects a donor pool <b>128</b> having the lowest priority out of all the donor pools. The goal module <b>103</b> then determines if the selected donor pool is active and able to donate levels of effort to the target pool at step <b>316</b>. A pool <b>128</b> is active when it is still transferring contact records to queues <b>130</b> and hasn't satisfied its final goal or quota. Goal module <b>103</b> examines the routing table for the selected donor pool to determine if the donor pool is able to donate levels of effort to the target pool. Since each pool <b>128</b> has its own routing table, goal module <b>103</b> must examine the routing table to determine if the donor pool is able to donate any levels of effort. Generally, if the selected donor pool is ahead of goal or at goal, it is able to donate a percentage of level of effort to the target pool regardless of the respective pool priorities. If the donor pool is behind goal but the target pool is of a higher priority, then generally the donor pool is available to donate some percentage of level of effort. If the donor pool is behind goal and the target pool is of the same priority or lower priority, then typically the donor pool is not able to donate any level of effort to the target pool.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">If at step <b>316</b> the donor pool is both active and able to donate a percentage of level of effort to the target pool, then at step <b>318</b> goal module <b>103</b> transfers a percentage of the level of effort from the donor pool to the target pool. Goal module <b>103</b> transfers the level of effort from the donor pool to the target pool by modifying the effort map in accordance with the limits specified in the routing table for the donor pool. To donate the level of effort from the donor pool to the target pool, goal module <b>103</b> examines the routing table for the donor pool to determine how much level of effort may be donated from the donor pool to the target pool. For instance using the example routing table in Table 3, if the target pool is of a higher priority than the donor pool and the donor pool is above its goal, then goal module <b>103</b> transfers 75% of the level of effort for the donor pool to the target pool. Therefore, if pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>is the donor pool and pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>is the target pool, goal module <b>103</b> transfers 75% of the level of effort for pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>to pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>thereby allowing queue <b>130</b><i>a </i>to receive 25% of its contact records from pool <b>128</b><i>a </i>and 75% of its contact records from pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>instead of queue <b>130</b><i>a </i>receiving 100% of its contact records from pool <b>128</b><i>a</i>. Pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>now supplies contact records to queues <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>d </i>instead of just queue <b>130</b><i>d </i>which allows additional agents <b>110</b> to access contact records from pool <b>128</b><i>c </i>and thereby meet the goal for pool <b>128</b><i>c</i>. Goal module <b>103</b> then modifies the effort map to reflect this change in the levels of effort between pools <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">After goal module <b>103</b> transfers the level of effort, at step <b>320</b> goal module <b>103</b> determines if there are additional donor pools to cycle through. If there are additional donor pools to cycle through, then the process returns to step <b>314</b> where goal module <b>103</b> selects the donor pool having the second lowest priority and the process repeats until there are no more donor pools to cycle through at step <b>320</b>. If at step <b>316</b> the donor pool is either not active or not able to donate a percentage of level of effort to the target pool, the process proceeds to step <b>320</b> where goal module <b>103</b> determines if there are additional donor pools to cycle through as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">When at step <b>320</b> goal module <b>103</b> determines that there are no more donor pools to cycle through, the process proceeds to step <b>310</b> where goal module <b>103</b> determines if there are any additional pools <b>128</b> to cycle through. If there are no more pools <b>128</b>, then the process ends. If there are additional pools, then the process returns to step <b>306</b> where goal module <b>103</b> selects the next pool <b>128</b> based on its priority to determine if it is behind its goal.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> repeats until goal module <b>103</b> has checked every pool <b>128</b> from highest to lowest priority to see if pools <b>128</b> are behind goal.

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An image processing unit determines the size of a circumscribed quadrangle of the target object, and predicts the overlap of the two different objects. If overlap is predicted, the target object is divided into two divided regions L_b and R_b containing the left and right edges of the target object respectively, and by performing a correlation calculation between the left image and the right image captured by a stereo camera for each of the divided regions, the parallaxes of the respective divided regions L_b and R_b can be determined. Then, if the absolute value of the difference between the parallaxes of the respective divided regions L_b and R_b is greater than a predetermined value, a determination is made that different objects are overlapping within the target object, and the target object is divided for recognition, and the distance to the respective objects is calculated independently.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image recognition apparatus for calculating the distance to a target object based on a binocular stereovision image obtained using two imaging devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, in order to notify the driver of a vehicle about an obstacle such as a pedestrian in its path, devices in which images taken by one or a plurality of cameras mounted on the front of the vehicle are displayed at a position visible from the driver's seat to complement the forward visibility of the driver, and devices which detect obstacles which may contact the vehicle based on the images taken by the cameras, and cause the vehicle to perform automatic avoidance operations, are already known. The image displayed to the driver is displayed on an image display apparatus such as a NAVIDisplay positioned in the console of the vehicle, a HUD (Head Up Display) which displays information at a position on the front window which does not obscure the forward visibility of the driver, or a meter integrated display which is integrated with a meter which displays the travel state of the vehicle numerically. Furthermore, the automatic avoidance operations of the vehicle are performed by automatically controlling a variety of actuators which are provided to operate each section of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example of this type of apparatus in which an image is taken of the environment in the vicinity of the vehicle, and obstacles which may contact the vehicle are detected from the captured image, is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 6-266828. In this apparatus, the images taken by two cameras are processed, and information on the distance distribution across the entire image is obtained, and by then calculating three dimensional positional information of target objects corresponding with the distance distribution information, the shape of the road and obstacles such as side walls are easily and accurately detected. Consequently, it is possible to individually recognize the presence of a plurality of obstacles, and either warn the driver of the vehicle, or have the vehicle perform automatic avoidance operations with a high degree of reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, conventional apparatuses such as those described above have a problem in that, when determining the distance distribution across the entire image, because the entire image is divided into regions of a certain size and the distance distribution is calculated for each region, the size of the region relative to the size of the target object is fixed, and the processing efficiency is thus poor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In other words, when the captured image of a target object occupies a large proportion of the entire image, because only a single distance to the target object need be obtained, if the target object is divided up more than necessary and the distance distribution for each region is determined, the efficiency of the processing is poor, and considerable time is required for the entire distance distribution to be calculated in order to calculate the distance to the target object.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide an image recognition apparatus which while taking into consideration the size of a target object in an image taken by the cameras, determines the presence of overlapping of different objects in the image using the parallax of the image, and when objects are overlapping, independently calculates the distances to the respective objects.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to solve the problems described above, an image recognition apparatus according to the present invention is an image recognition apparatus which measures the parallax of a target object based on images respectively obtained by two imaging devices and calculates the distance to the target object based on the parallax, comprising an image determination device (for example step S<b>26</b> through step S<b>30</b> in the embodiment of the invention) which sets determination regions which have sufficient height to include the target object and independently contain left and right edges of the target object respectively, and determines whether different objects are overlapping by measuring and comparing the parallaxes of the respective determination regions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Using the image determination device, the image recognition apparatus sets a region for each target object, taking into consideration the different heights of the captured objects, so as to include the left or the right edge of the target object, and by comparing the parallaxes of these regions, obtains comparison results indicating whether the parallaxes of the left and right edges coincide or differ. Consequently, a determination can be made as to whether the left portion and the right portion of a target object are portions of the same object, or are portions of different objects, enabling the presence of overlapping objects to be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Consequently, because the region used to determine the parallaxes is set depending on the size of each captured target object, the parallaxes can always be determined efficiently regardless of the size of the captured target object corresponding to the distance between the vehicle and the target object.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the aforementioned image recognition apparatus, the image determination device may include an image separation device (for example step S<b>30</b> in the embodiment of the invention) which, in those cases where the overlapping of different objects is recognized, sets distance determination points in the determination regions upon the edges of the determination regions, and independently calculates the distance to each of the respective objects.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When a target object is recognized by the image determination device as representing a plurality of different overlapping objects, the image recognition apparatus can calculate the distance to the respective objects using the respective left and right edges of the target object as the distance determination points, thereby separating and capturing the objects.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Consequently, situations in which the distance to a target object cannot be calculated because the presence in the image of different objects in a state of overlap causes the parallaxes of the target object to be different at different locations can be prevented, and it becomes possible to accurately determine the distance to each different object.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The image recognition apparatus may comprise an image prediction device (for example step S<b>21</b> in the embodiment of the invention) which predicts the overlap of different objects if a region surrounding the target object is larger than a predetermined size, or a ratio of a length in the vertical direction to a length in the horizontal direction of the region surrounding the target object is less than a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Before determining whether different objects are overlapping by using the image determination device, the image recognition apparatus can also make a prediction using the image prediction device as to whether or not the target object comprises different overlapping objects, using the size of the region surrounding the target object, or the ratio of the length in the vertical direction to the length in the horizontal direction of the region surrounding the target object, and then conduct a determination using the image determination device only if the target object is predicted to comprise different overlapping objects (only if the possibility is high).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Consequently, because the calculations of the image determination device are only executed when there is a high possibility that the target object comprises different overlapping objects, the processing load in the image recognition apparatus can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the image recognition apparatus, the image determination device may set calculation regions containing the determination regions on the periphery of each determination region respectively, and calculate the parallaxes by performing a correlation calculation between the calculation regions corresponding with respective images obtained by the two imaging devices.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the image recognition apparatus, the image determination device may determine that different objects are overlapping when an absolute value of a difference between the parallax of the determination region containing the aforementioned left edge and the parallax of the determination region containing the aforementioned right edge is greater than a predetermined value.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing the structure of an image recognition apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numeral <b>1</b> is an image processing unit comprising a CPU (central processing unit) which controls the image recognition apparatus of this embodiment, to which are connected two infrared cameras <b>2</b>R and <b>2</b>L which can detect far infrared radiation, a yaw rate sensor <b>3</b> which detects the yaw rate of the vehicle, a vehicle speed sensor <b>4</b> which detects the traveling speed (vehicle speed) of the vehicle, and a brake sensor <b>5</b> which detects the operation of the brakes. In this configuration, the image processing unit <b>1</b> detects a moving object such as a pedestrian or animal in front of the vehicle based on an infrared image of the vicinity of the vehicle and signals which indicate the travel state of the vehicle, and issues a warning when it is determined that the possibility of a collision is high.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, a speaker <b>6</b> for issuing a warning by speech, and an image display apparatus <b>7</b> including, for example, a meter integrated display having an integrated meter for showing numerically the travel state of the vehicle, a NAVIDisplay mounted in the console of the vehicle, or a HUD (head up display) <b>7</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which displays information at a position on the front window at a position which does not obscure the forward visibility of the driver, which displays the image taken by the infrared cameras <b>2</b>R and <b>2</b>L and allows the driver of the vehicle to recognize objects which present a collision danger, are also connected to the image processing unit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, the image processing unit <b>1</b> comprises an A/D conversion circuit which converts input analog signals into digital signals, an image memory which stores the digitized image signal, a CPU (Central Processing Unit) which performs various operation processes, RAM (Random Access Memory) which is used by the CPU to store data which is being processed, ROM (Read Only Memory) for storing tables, maps, programs executed by the CPU, and the like, and an output circuit which outputs a drive signal for the speaker <b>6</b> and a display signal for the HUD <b>7</b><i>a </i>or the like. The image processing unit <b>1</b> is structured so that the output signals of the infrared cameras <b>2</b>R and <b>2</b>L, the yaw rate sensor <b>3</b>, the vehicle speed sensor <b>4</b>, and the brake sensors <b>5</b> are converted to digital signals and then input into the CPU.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the infrared cameras <b>2</b>R and <b>2</b>L are mounted to the front of the vehicle <b>10</b> at substantially symmetrical positions relative to the center in the transverse direction of the vehicle <b>10</b>, the optical axes of the two infrared cameras <b>2</b>R and <b>2</b>L are parallel to each other, and both of the cameras are fixed at equal heights above the surface of the road. A characteristic of the infrared cameras <b>2</b>R and <b>2</b>L is that the output signal level becomes higher (the brightness increases) as the temperature of the target object increases</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the HUD <b>7</b><i>a </i>is mounted so that the display screen is displayed at a position on the front window of the vehicle <b>10</b> which does not obscure the forward visibility of the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, the operation of the present embodiment is described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart showing the processing sequence in the image processing unit <b>1</b> provided in the image recognition apparatus according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, the image processing unit <b>1</b> captures the infrared image, which is the output signal of the infrared cameras <b>2</b>R and <b>2</b>L (step S<b>1</b>), performs an A/D conversion thereon (step S<b>2</b>), and stores the gray scale image in the image memory (step S<b>3</b>). Here, the right image is obtained by the infrared camera <b>2</b>R and the left image is obtained by the infrared camera <b>2</b>L. Furthermore, because the horizontal position of the same target object on the display screen is displayed out of horizontal shift in the right image and the left image, the distance to the target object can be calculated using this shift (parallax).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, the right image obtained from the infrared camera <b>2</b>R is deemed the reference image, and binary processing is performed on this image signal. In this binary processing, a &#x201c;1&#x201d; (white) is assigned to a region brighter than a brightness threshold value ITH, and a &#x201c;0&#x201d; (black) is assigned to a darker region (step S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a gray scale image obtained by the infrared camera <b>2</b>R, and by performing binary processing on this image, the image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is obtained. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the objects within the frames P<b>1</b> through P<b>4</b> are deemed the target objects and are displayed as white (referred to as &#x201c;high brightness regions&#x201d; below) on the display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Once the binary image data from the infrared images is obtained, processing is performed in which the binary image data is converted to run length data (step S<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a diagram which describes this process, and in this diagram the regions which have become white due to binary processing are shown as the lines L<b>1</b> to L<b>8</b> in pixel units. The lines L<b>1</b> to L<b>8</b> all have a width of 1 pixel in the y direction, and while they are actually arranged without a space therebetween in the y direction, they have been separated for ease of description. Furthermore, the lines L<b>1</b> to L<b>8</b> have lengths of 2 pixels, 2 pixels, 3 pixels, 8 pixels, 7 pixels, 8 pixels, 8 pixels, and 8 pixels in the x direction, respectively. The run length data includes the coordinates of the start point of each of the lines (the leftmost point of each line) and the length (number of pixels) from the start point to the end point (the rightmost point of each line) of the lines L<b>1</b> to L<b>8</b>. For example, the line L<b>3</b> comprises the 3 pixels (x3, y5), (x4, y5), and (x5, y5), and thus (x3, y5, 3) becomes the run length data.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, by labeling the target objects based on the image data converted into run length data (step S<b>6</b>), the processing in which the target objects are extracted is performed (step S<b>7</b>). In other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, of the lines L<b>1</b> to L<b>8</b> which have been converted to run length data, the lines L<b>1</b> to L<b>3</b>, which have portions which overlap in the y direction, are considered to be one target object <b>1</b>, and lines L<b>4</b> to L<b>8</b> are considered to be one target object <b>2</b>, and the target object labels <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are appended to the run length data. By performing this processing, for example, the high brightness regions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> are recognized as target objects <b>1</b> through <b>4</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Once the extraction of the target objects is completed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the center of gravity G, the surface area S, and the aspect ratio ASPECT of the circumscribed quadrangle represented by the broken lines are calculated for each of the extracted target objects (step S<b>8</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Here, the surface area S is calculated by adding the lengths of the run length data for the same target object using a formula (1) below. If the run length data of the target object A is (x [i], y [i], run [i], A) (i=0, 1, 2, . . . , N&#x2212;1), then</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, the aspect ratio ASPECT is calculated as the ratio Dy/Dx of the values Dy and Dx shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in the formulas (1), (2) and (3), the run length data is expressed as a number of pixels (number of coordinates) run [i], and consequently 1 must be subtracted to obtain the actual length. Furthermore, the position of the center of gravity G can be substituted with the position of the center of gravity of the circumscribed quadrangle.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Once the center of gravity, the surface area, and the aspect ratio of the circumscribed quadrangle of the target object have been calculated, time tracking of the target object, or in other words recognition of the same target object in each sampling cycle, is performed (step S<b>9</b>). In time tracking, the time at which a time t, which is an analogue value, is digitized in a sampling cycle is termed k, and when the target objects A and B are extracted at time k as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a determination of identification of the target objects C and D extracted at time k+1 is performed with the target objects A and B. Specifically, when the following conditions of identification determination 1) to 3) are satisfied, the target objects A and B are determined to be the same as the target objects C and D, and the labels of the target objects C and D are changed to show target objects A and B, respectively. As a result, time tracking is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">1) If the coordinates of the position of the center of gravity of the object i (=A, B) in the image at time k are (xi (k), yi (k)) respectively, and the coordinates of the position of the center of gravity of the object j (=C, D) in the image at time k+1 are (xj (k+1), yj (k+1)), then |xj (k+1)&#x2212;xi (k)|&#x3c;&#x394;x|yj (k+1)&#x2212;yi (k)|&#x3c;y, where &#x394;x and &#x394;y denote the allowable values of the amount of movement in the image in the x direction and the y direction respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">2) If the surface area of the object i (=A, B) in the image at time k is Si (k) and the surface area of the object j (=C, D) in the image at time (k+1) is Sj (k+1), then Sj (k+1)/Si(k)&#x3c;1&#xb1;&#x394;S, where &#x394;S denotes the allowable range of variation in the surface area.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">3) If the aspect ratio of the circumscribed quadrangle of the object i (=A, B) at time k is ASPECT i (k), and the aspect ratio of the circumscribed quadrangle of the object j (=C, D) at time (k+1) is ASPECT j (k+1), then ASPECT j (k+1)/ASPECT i (k)&#x3c;1&#xb1;&#x394; ASPECT, where &#x394; ASPECT denotes the allowable range of variation in the aspect ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, when comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, although the sizes of each of the target objects in the image are larger in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, because the target object A and the target object C fulfill the requirements for identification determination described above, and the target object B and the target object D also fulfill the requirements for identification determination described above, the target objects C and D are recognized as the target objects A and B respectively. In this manner, the position coordinates (of the center of gravity) of each of the recognized target objects are stored in the memory as time series position data to be used in later calculation processing.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The processing in steps S<b>4</b> to S<b>9</b> described above is performed on a binary reference image (in this embodiment, the right image).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, the vehicle speed VCAR detected by the vehicle speed sensor <b>4</b> and the yaw rate YR detected by the yaw rate sensor <b>3</b> are read, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the turning angle &#x3b8;r of the vehicle <b>10</b> is calculated by performing a time integration of the yaw rate YR (step S<b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">On the other hand, processing which calculates the distance z between the target object and the vehicle <b>10</b> is performed in steps S<b>11</b> through S<b>13</b>, in parallel with the processing in step S<b>9</b> and step S<b>10</b>. Because these calculations require a longer time than step S<b>9</b> and step S<b>10</b>, they are executed with a longer cycle than step S<b>9</b> and S<b>10</b> (for example with a cycle which is about three times as long as the execution cycle of steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">First, by selecting one of the target objects tracked by the binary image of the reference image (the right image), a search image R<b>1</b> (here, the entire region surrounded by the circumscribed quadrangle is deemed the search image) is extracted from the right image (step S<b>11</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Next, a search region is set for searching for an image (referred to as the &#x201c;corresponding image&#x201d; below) within the left image which corresponds to the search image, and the corresponding image is extracted by executing a correlation calculation (step S<b>12</b>). Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the search region R<b>2</b> in the left image is set in accordance with each of the vertex coordinates of the search image R<b>1</b>, and the brightness difference total value C (a, b), which indicates the degree of correlation with the search image R<b>1</b> in the search region R<b>2</b>, is calculated by a formula (4) shown below, and the region in which this total value C (a, b) is smallest is extracted as the corresponding image. This correlation calculation is performed using the gray scale image rather than the binary image.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Furthermore, if there is historical position data for the same target object, a region R<b>2</b><i>a </i>(indicated by the broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) which is smaller than the search region R<b>2</b> is set as the search region based on this position data.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Here, IR (m, n) is the brightness value at the position of the coordinates (m, n) in the search region R<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and IL (a+m&#x2212;M, b+n&#x2212;N) is the brightness value at the position of the coordinates (m, n) in a local region R<b>3</b> of the same shape as the search region R<b>1</b>, using the coordinates (a, b) in the search region as a base point. The position of the corresponding image is defined by changing the coordinates (a, b) of the base point and finding the position at which the total value C (a, b) of the brightness difference is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Because the search image R<b>1</b> is extracted within the reference image (the right image) and the corresponding image R<b>4</b> corresponding to the target object is extracted within the left image by the processing in step S<b>12</b>, next, the position of the center of gravity of the search image R<b>1</b>, the position of the center of gravity of the corresponding image R<b>4</b>, and the parallax &#x394;d (as a number of pixels) are determined, and the distance z between the vehicle <b>10</b> and the target object is calculated by applying a formula (5) shown below (step S<b>13</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Here, (xc, yc) are the coordinates (x, y) of the right image which have been converted to coordinates in a virtual image in which the real space origin O and the center of the image have been made to coincide based on the relative positional relationship between the mounting position of the infrared camera <b>2</b>R and the real space origin O. Furthermore, f is the ratio between the focal length F and the pixel separation p.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Furthermore, once the real space coordinates are obtained, turning angle compensation is performed in order to compensate for the positional shift in the image caused by the turning of the vehicle <b>10</b> (step S<b>15</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for example, if the vehicle <b>10</b> turns to the left by a turning angle of &#x3b8;r during the interval from time k to time (k+1), then a shift in the x direction by an amount equivalent to &#x394;x as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> occurs in the image obtained by the camera, and the turning angle compensation is a process to compensate for this shift. Specifically, the real space coordinates (X, Y, Z) are applied to a formula (7) below, and the compensated coordinates (Xr, Yr, Zr) are calculated. The calculated real space position data (Xr, Yr, Zr) is stored in the memory, associated with each target object. In the description below, the coordinates after turning angle compensation are shown as (X, Y, Z).</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A relative motion vector is obtained as a vector directed from the position coordinates Pv(N&#x2212;1) calculated in formula (9) towards Pv(0).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">By determining the relative motion vector in this manner, by calculating an approximately straight line which approximates the relative motion locus of the target object relative to the vehicle <b>10</b> based on a plurality (N pieces) of data within the monitoring period &#x394;T, the influence of position detection errors can be reduced, and it is possible to more accurately predict the possibility of a collision with the target object.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Furthermore, once the relative motion vector is determined in step S<b>16</b>, next, a warning determination process which determines the possibility of a collision with the detected target object is performed (step S<b>17</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The warning determination process (step S<b>17</b>) is processing which, by using any one of collision determination processing, processing to determine whether or not a target object is in an approach determination region, or intrusion collision determination processing, each of which is described below, determines the possibility of the vehicle <b>10</b> colliding with the detected target object. The description below uses an example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in which an animal <b>20</b> is approaching the path of the vehicle at a velocity Vp from a substantially 90&#xb0; angle relative to the direction of forward motion of the vehicle <b>10</b>.</p>

In collision determination processing, a collision is considered likely when the formulas (11) and (12) below are true.

Furthermore, T is a margin time which signifies that the possibility of a collision is determined time T before the predicted collision time, and accordingly, T is set to a value of approximately 2 to 5 seconds, for example. Furthermore, H is a predetermined height which defines the range of the Y direction, that is the height direction, and is set to about twice the height of the vehicle <b>10</b>, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Here, AR<b>1</b> is a region corresponding with a range produced by adding a margin of &#x3b2; (for example approximately 50 to 100 cm) to both sides of the width &#x3b1; of the vehicle <b>10</b>, or in other words, a region having a width of (&#x3b1;/2+&#x3b2;) on both sides of a central axis positioned along the center in the width direction of vehicle <b>10</b>, and if the target object remains in this region the possibility of a collision is extremely high, and consequently this region is called an approach determination region. The regions AR<b>2</b> and AR<b>3</b> are regions (on the outside of the approach determination region in a transverse direction) in which the absolute value of the X coordinate is larger than the approach determination region, and because intrusion collision determination, described below, is performed on target objects inside these regions, they are called intrusion determination regions. These regions have a predetermined height H in the Y direction, as shown in formula (12) above.</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0117">Next, in the image processing unit <b>1</b>, a determination is made based on the results of the correlation calculation executed in step S<b>21</b>, as to whether or not there is a high degree of correlation between the target object <b>50</b> in the right image and the target object <b>50</b> in the left image (step S<b>23</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0118">In step S<b>23</b>, if there is a low degree of correlation between the target object <b>50</b> in the right image and the target object <b>50</b> in the left image (NO in step S<b>23</b>), this target object is eliminated as an object for detection (step S<b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0119">Furthermore, in step S<b>23</b>, if there is a high degree of correlation between the target object <b>50</b> in the right image and the target object <b>50</b> in the left image (YES in step S<b>23</b>), the distance to the target object is calculated using the formula (5) above (step S<b>25</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0120">On the other hand, if in step S<b>21</b>, the width X of the circumscribed quadrangle <b>51</b> is equal to or greater than the predetermined value A, and the ratio of the length in the vertical direction (height Y) to the length in the transverse direction (width X) of the circumscribed quadrangle <b>51</b> is equal to or less than the predetermined value B (NO in step S<b>21</b>), then the image processing unit <b>1</b> predicts the likelihood of overlapping of the target object, and as shown in the right image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the target object is divided into two regions, namely a divided region L_b<b>52</b> and a divided region R_b<b>53</b>, containing the left and right edges of the target object respectively (step S<b>26</b>). Here, the widths of the divided region L_b<b>52</b> and the divided region R_b<b>53</b> are set to widths equal to the predetermined value A from the left and right edges, respectively, and the heights are set to the height Y of the circumscribed quadrangle <b>51</b> prior to division.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0121">Next, as shown in the right image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, correlation calculation blocks <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> are set around the periphery of the divided regions L_b<b>52</b> and R_b<b>53</b> respectively, and, as shown in the left image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, correlation calculations are then performed with correlation calculation blocks <b>60</b> and <b>61</b> set around target objects <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> in the left image which correspond to the target object <b>50</b> in the right image, and the parallax dn_L and the parallax dn_R respectively are calculated (step S<b>27</b>). Once the respective parallaxes dn_L and dn_R are found, a determination is made in the image processing unit <b>1</b> as to whether or not the absolute value of the difference between the parallax dn_L and the parallax dn_R in the calculated parallax amounts (dn_L, dn_R) is less than a predetermined value TH (step S<b>28</b>), that is, whether or not the formula |dn_L&#x2212;dn_R|&#x3c;TH is true.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0122">In step S<b>28</b>, if the absolute value of the difference between the parallax dn_L and the parallax dn_R is less than the predetermined value TH (YES in step S<b>28</b>), then a determination can be made that the left and right edges of the target object have the same parallax, and that a state in which different objects overlap has not occurred. Consequently, instead of dividing the target object and then performing recognition, the target object parallax is calculated as dn=(d_L+d_R)/2, the process proceeds to step S<b>25</b>, and the distance to the target object is calculated using the formula (5) above (step S<b>25</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0123">Furthermore, in step S<b>28</b>, if the absolute value of the difference between the parallax dn_L and the parallax dn_R is equal to or greater than the predetermined value TH (NO in step S<b>28</b>), then a determination can be made that the parallaxes of the left and right edges of the target object are different, and that the target object consists of different objects which overlap. Consequently, the target object is divided into two target objects <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> of Lb and Rb for recognition. At this time, as shown in the right image and the left image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the centers of gravity of the respective target objects (a left edge target object center of gravity <b>62</b>, and a right edge target object center of gravity <b>63</b>) are set to the edges of the divided regions L_b<b>52</b>, <b>58</b> and the divided regions R_b<b>53</b>, <b>59</b> in the transverse direction, and set to the same height as the target object center of gravity <b>64</b> prior to division in the height direction (step S<b>30</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0124">The process then proceeds to step S<b>25</b>, and the distance to each of the respective target objects is calculated using formula (5) above (step S<b>25</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0125">In step S<b>30</b> described above, of the objects which are overlapping, those which are unnecessary may be eliminated as target objects for detection.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0126">Furthermore, the above embodiment was described using a case in which a determination was made as to whether a target object consists of different objects overlapping, and in the case of overlap, the target object was divided into two target objects for recognition. However, it is also possible, for a single target object which is long in the distance direction, to determine by the same method, the difference in parallax caused by differences in the position on the target object which occur because the object is long in the distance direction, and then accurately estimate the position of the target object.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0127">In addition, the embodiment described above used an example in which the front of the vehicle was monitored, but any other direction, such as the rear of the vehicle, may also be monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0128">Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above, and many variations are possible. For example, in the embodiment described above, infrared cameras were used as the imaging devices for obtaining images of the target object, but it is also possible to use a video camera which can detect only standard visible light, as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 9-226490. However, because it is possible to simplify the extraction processing of animals or moving vehicles by using infrared cameras, the present invention can be realized using a computing unit with even relatively low computing capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0129">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the image processing unit <b>1</b> includes an extraction region setting device, a search region setting device, an object recognition device, and a parallax calculation device. More specifically, step S<b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> corresponds to an image prediction device, and steps S<b>26</b> through S<b>30</b> corresponds to an image determination device. In addition, step S<b>30</b> corresponds to an image separation device.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0130">As described above, in an image recognition apparatus of the present embodiment, even if two different overlapping objects are extracted by binary processing as a single target object, the distance to the respective edges can be calculated from the parallax of the left and right edges of the target object.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0131">Consequently, it is possible to determine based on the difference in the distances to the left and right edges that different objects are overlapping within the target object, and then accurately estimate the position of the target object based on the position of the edge points of respective target objects (objects) and the distance to the edge points of the respective target objects. Furthermore, using the same method it is also possible to accurately calculate the position of not only overlapping objects, but also target objects which are long in the distance direction, by measuring the positions of the left and right edges.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Reference is made to commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/178,260, filed Jun. 24, 2002, entitled &#x201c;Enhancing the Tonal Characteristics of Digital Images&#x201d; by Edward B. Gindele, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to digital image processing and in particular to processing a digital image to enhance its color, brightness, and tone scale characteristics.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many digital imaging systems enhance the contrast and lightness characteristics of digital images through the application of a tone scale curve. For a generalized tone scale curve &#x192;( ), the input pixel value x is transformed to an output pixel value &#x192;(x). The shape of the tone scale curve determines the visual effect imparted to the processed digital image. Some tone scale curves applied to digital image are independent of the pixel values in the digital image to be processed. Such image independent tone scale curves are useful for establishing a photographic look to the processed digital images. While image independent tone scale curves can be used to enhance many digital images, digital images that are either too high or low in contrast can benefit from the application of a tone scale curve that is responsive to the distribution of pixel values in the digital image to be processed. For image dependent tone scale curves, the mathematical formula used to generate the function &#x192;(x) determines the degree and nature of the image enhancement.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One class of tone scale function generation methods is derived from histogram equalization. A histogram function H(x), i.e. a function of the frequency of occurrence, is calculated from the pixel values x of a digital image. Next the function &#x192;(x) is determined for which the histogram function of the processed pixels H(&#x192;(x)) will have a particular aim functional W(x). The function &#x192;(x) that satisfies this constraint can be calculated given the expression &#x192;(x)=kC(W<sup>1</sup>(H(x))) where the variable k is a normalizing constant. For the special case where the aim functional W(x) is a constant, the expression for the tone scale curve &#x192;(x) is given by the expression &#x192;(x)=kC(H(x)).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are many prior art examples of histogram equalization based methods: In commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,731,671 Alkofer discloses a method of using a Gaussian function as the aim function W(x). In commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,465 Kwon discloses a method of generating a tone scale curve also employing a histogram equalization derived method wherein a Gaussian function is used as the aim function W(x). In Kwon's method, the image histogram is calculated by sampling pixels within the image that have been classified as spatially active. An edge detection spatial filter is used to determine the degree of local spatial activity for each image pixel. The local spatial activity measure is compared with a threshold to determine if the pixel value will contribute to the histogram function used to generate the tone scale curve. As with less sophisticated histogram equalization based methods, the methods disclosed by Alkofer and Kwon suffer from inconsistent image enhancement performance. This is principally due to the fact that histogram equalization methods tend to optimize the visualization of image content based on the frequency of occurrence of the corresponding pixel values. As a consequence, extremely bright or dark image areas that are represented by a small percentage of image area can be overwhelmed by more prevalent image areas resulting in tone scale adjusted images that have specular highlights that are rendered too dark and deep shadows that are rendered too light. Therefore, histogram equalization based methods are more suited to image exploitation applications requiring the visualization of image detail than to applications involving the tone reproduction of natural scenes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,798 Lee discloses a method of generating a tone scale curve for the purposes of reducing the dynamic range of a digital image. The tone scale curve construction method establishes six constraints and then performs a successive integration procedure to satisfy the constraints. In Lee's method, a dark point determined by the 0.5% image cumulative histogram function value is mapped to a white paper density, a bright point determined by the 99.5% image cumulative histogram function value is mapped to a black paper density, and a mid-point is mapped to itself. Next a shadow slope constraint of greater than 1.0 is imposed at the 0.5% shadow point, a highlight slope constraint of 1.0 is imposed at the 99.5% highlight point, and a mid-tone slope constraint of 1.0 is imposed at the mid-point. Lee states that there are an infinite number of tone scale curves that can satisfy the six constraints. Lee's method constructs a tone scale curve that satisfies the six constraints by assuming an arbitrary initial shape for the tone scale curve and successively convolving the tone scale curve with a Gaussian smoothing function until, upon examination, the tone scale curve satisfies the six constraints to within some acceptable tolerance. Lee's method does not discuss a closed form solution, i.e. a mathematical function that can be evaluated for each point, to the six constraints and therefore must rely the complicated integration procedure. The tone scale curves so constructed are smoothly varying achieving a high slope value at the extremes and at the mid-point with an inflection point between the mid-point and the highlight point and an inflection point between the mid-point and the shadow point. While Lee's method disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,798 can produce smoothly varying tone scale curves, the method does not always converge to a curve that satisfies the six constraints. Furthermore, the Lee's method does not account for the possibility that some digital images require an expansion of the dynamic range of the digital image to achieve enhancement. In addition, the high slope constraints imposed at the extremes and at the mid point of the pixel intensity domain can sometimes lead to a sacrifice of quality for image content corresponding to pixel values that lie between the shadow point and the mid-point, and the mid-point and the highlight point.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the journal article entitled &#x201c;Image lightness rescaling using sigmoidal contrast enhancement functions&#x201d; published in the Journal of Electronic Images Vol. 8(4), p380&#x2013;393 (October 1999), authors Braun et al. discuss a method of using a single sigmoidal function, e.g. as the integral-of-a-Gaussian function, as a method of generating a tone scale curve that can be used for contrast enhancement of digital images. The sigmoidal function presented by Braun et al. is controlled with a standard deviation and offset parameter which determine the shape of the function. The offset parameter is used to impart lightness changes to digital images while the standard deviation parameter is used to impart contrast changes. While the sigmoidal shaped tone scale curve generation method presented by Braun et al. provides photographically acceptable results, the shape of the function corresponding to shadow and highlight regions of images is not independently controllable. Consequently, for a given digital image, it can be difficult to achieve the desired degree of contrast enhancement while simultaneously achieving the optimum image lightness rendition.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to improve the method for producing a tone scale function that can be used to enhance the tonal characteristics of a digital image.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This object is achieved by a method of producing a tone scale function which can operate on a source digital image to improve tonal characteristics, comprising the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a) receiving a source digital image including a plurality of pixels; and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">b) producing a tone scale function having a highlight tone scale segment and a shadow tone scale segment defined relative to a reference point on the tone scale function, and that is adapted to operate on the source digital image to improve its tonal characteristics, wherein:

    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">i) the highlight tone scale segment is defined by a different mathematical function than the shadow tone scale segment;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">ii) at least one of the highlight tone scale or shadow tone scale segments have at least one inflection point;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0014">iii) the highlight tone scale segment is defined for points that are equal to or greater than the reference point; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0015">iv) the shadow tone scale segment is defined for points that are equal to or less than the reference point.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">By practicing the present invention, the characteristics of the highlight and shadow regions of the digital image are significantly enhanced. It is an important feature of the present invention that at least one of the highlight tone scale or shadow tone scale segments or both have at least one inflection point. A highlight inflection point allows the extreme specular highlight regions of images to rendered to a paper white density thus preserving the visual impression of specular highlights. Similarly, a shadow inflection point allows the darkest regions of images to rendered to a paper black density thus preserving the visual impression of deep shadows.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0017">The present invention facilitates using tone scale functions to improve the rendition of highlight and shadow regions wherein the shape of the tone scale function achieves an inflection point independently for highlight and shadow image regions and such inflection points are independently controllable of each other.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">In the following description, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described as a software program. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the equivalent of such software may also be constructed in hardware. Because image processing algorithms and systems are well known, the present description will be directed in particular to algorithms and systems forming part of, or cooperating more directly with, the method in accordance with the present invention. Other aspects of such algorithms and systems, and hardware and/or software for producing and otherwise processing the image signals involved therewith, not specifically shown or described herein, may be selected from such systems, algorithms, components and elements thereof known in the art. Given the description as set forth in the following specification, all software implementation thereof as a computer program is conventional and within the ordinary skill in such arts.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">Still further, as used herein, the computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, which may comprise, for example: magnetic storage media such as a magnetic disk (such as a floppy disk) or magnetic tape; optical storage media such as an optical disc, optical tape, or machine readable bar code; solid state electronic storage devices such as random access memory (RAM), or read only memory (ROM); or any other physical device or medium employed to store a computer program.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">A digital image is comprised of one or more digital image channels. Each digital image channel is comprised of a two-dimensional array of pixels. Each pixel value relates to the amount of light received by the imaging capture device corresponding to the geometrical domain of the pixel. For color imaging applications, a digital image will typically consist of red, green, and blue digital image channels. Other configurations are also practiced, e.g. cyan, magenta, and yellow digital image channels. For monochrome applications, the digital image consists of one digital image channel. Motion imaging applications can be thought of as a time sequence of digital images. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention can be applied to, but is not limited to, a digital image channel for any of the above mentioned applications.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">Although the present invention describes a digital image channel as a two-dimensional array of pixels values arranged by rows and columns, those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention can be applied to mosaic (non-rectilinear) arrays with equal effect.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">The present invention may be implemented in computer hardware. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the following description relates to a digital imaging system which includes an image capture device <b>10</b>, a digital image processor <b>20</b>, image output devices <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b</i>, and a general control computer <b>40</b>. The system may include a monitor device <b>50</b> such as a computer console or paper printer. The system may also include an input control device <b>60</b> for an operator such as a keyboard and or mouse pointer. Still further, as used herein, the present invention may be implemented as a computer program and may be stored in a computer memory device <b>70</b>, i.e. a computer readable storage medium, which may comprise, for example: magnetic storage media such as a magnetic disk (such as a floppy disk) or magnetic tape; optical storage media such as an optical disc, optical tape, or machine readable bar code; solid state electronic storage devices such as random access memory (RAM), or read only memory (ROM); or any other physical device or medium employed to store a computer program. Before describing the present invention, it facilitates understanding to note that the present invention is preferably utilized on any well known computer system, such as a personal computer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">Multiple image capture devices <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, and <b>10</b><i>c </i>are shown illustrating that the present invention can be used for digital images derived from a variety of imaging devices. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can represent a digital photofinishing system where the image capture device <b>10</b><i>a </i>may be a film scanner device which produces digital images by scanning a conventional photographic image, e.g. color negative film or slide film transparencies. Similarly, image capture device <b>10</b><i>b </i>could be a digital camera. The digital image processor <b>20</b> provides the means for processing the digital images to produce pleasing looking images on an intended output device or media. Multiple image output devices <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>are shown illustrating that the present invention may be used in conjunction with a variety of output devices which may include a digital photographic printer and soft copy display. It should also be noted that the present invention can be implemented within the hardware and software of a digital camera such that the digital images produced by the digital camera have been processed with the present invention prior to being exported by the digital camera.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">The digital image processor <b>20</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The cascaded image processing modules shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents a digital image processing path. The original digital image <b>101</b> is received from one of the image input devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and processed to produce a rendered digital image <b>103</b> that can be realized on an image output device. The RLSE (relative log scene exposure) conversion module <b>310</b> receives the original digital image <b>101</b> and generates an RLSE digital image that is prepared for balancing and the application of a tone scale function. The scene balance module <b>320</b> receives the RLSE digital image and performs a lightness and color balance adjustment resulting in a source digital image <b>102</b>. The tone scale module <b>330</b> receives the source digital image, generates a tone scale function from the source digital image and applies the tone scale function to the source digital image resulting in an enhanced digital image. If the RLSE conversion module <b>310</b> and the scene balance module <b>320</b> are omitted from the image processing path of modules, the tone scale module <b>330</b> receives the original digital image <b>101</b> directly as the source digital image. The rendering module <b>340</b> processes the enhanced digital image such that the pixel values of the generated rendered digital image <b>103</b> have been prepared to yield a pleasing result when used in conjunction with an output image device such as a digital printer. As part of the processing performed by the rendering module <b>340</b>, a rendering function R(x) is applied to the pixel data of the enhanced digital image to achieve the input to output pixel mapping required of the output image device. The configuration of processing modules shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is used for processing digital images that are either monochrome or color in nature. That is, the original digital image <b>101</b> includes one or more digital image channels of pixels wherein each digital image channel relates to a different color or pixels such as, an original digital image <b>101</b> that includes red, green, and blue representation or a luminance-chrominance representation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">The tone scale functions produced by the present invention are designed to work best with digital images that are in a relative log scene exposure representation (RLSE). That is, the pixels of the original digital image <b>101</b> have a logarithmic relationship with respect to the original scene intensities of light from which the original digital image <b>101</b> is derived. For example, the image capture device <b>10</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can represent a photographic film scanner that produces digital images that have a linear or logarithmic relationship with the amount of transmitted light projected through a photographic negative or positive film transparency sample. If the pixels values of the resultant original digital image <b>101</b> have a logarithm relationship with the received light (i.e. the pixels are in a density representation), the original digital image <b>101</b> is considered to be in a relative log scene exposure representation. If the pixels of the original digital image <b>101</b> have a linear relationship with the received light, the original digital image <b>101</b> is considered to be in a linear exposure representation since, to within a reasonable approximation, the amount of light transmitted through the photographic film sample is linearly proportional to the amount of light received from the original photographed scene. A linear exposure representation digital image can be transformed into a relative log scene exposure representation by a linear-to-logarithmic transform implemented as function or as look-up-table (LUT) with the RLSE module <b>310</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">The most common representation of digital images produced with digital cameras is a rendered representation, i.e. the digital image has been processed such that it will be yield a natural appearing image on an electronic display device. For most digital images produced with digital cameras the intended output image device is a CRT monitor device sometimes referred to as a gamma domain representation. Rendered digital images can also be transformed into a relative log scene exposure representation using a LUT transform. For digital images produced with digital cameras, the transform includes an inverse of the power law function associated with the intended electronic display device followed by an inverse rendering tone scale function related to the rendering tone scale function that the digital camera used to produce the original digital image <b>101</b>. Alternatively, the method disclosed by McCarthy et al. in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,282,311 can be used to produce an RLSE representation from a rendered digital image.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">While the best results are achieved with digital images that are in a relative log scene exposure representation, the present invention can be used to enhance the appearance of digital images that are in other representations such as linear and gamma domain representations described above. In particular, the present invention can be used to process digital images that are in a visual domain such as CIELAB (one of the color spaces defined by the International Commission on Illumination abbreviated as CIE).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">The scene balance module <b>320</b> receives the RLSE digital image from the RLSE conversion module <b>310</b> and performs a lightness and color balance adjustment. The resulting processed digital image is called the source digital image <b>102</b> since it is the input digital image to the tone scale module <b>330</b>. The lightness adjustment to the pixel data accounts for exposure variability in the original digital image <b>101</b>. The present invention can be used with any algorithm that performs a lightness adjustment, or luminance balance, of the input pixel data. In particular, the lightness balance procedure includes calculating one or more prediction features from the RLSE digital image. These predication features are combined using a linear equation of the prediction features into a single brightness balance value that relates to an estimate of the pixel value corresponding to a theoretical 18% gray scene reflector. While there are many such prediction features that are useful, the present invention uses a spatial activity measure as the most important prediction feature. An RLSE luminance-chrominance digital image is generated from the RLSE digital image. Next, a spatial activity filter is applied to the luminance pixel data of the RLSE luminance-chrominance digital image. The spatial activity filter calculates the minimum difference of adjacent pixel values within a 3 by 3 pixel region and assigns the minimum difference to the pixel. Pixels with minimum difference values that exceed a predetermined threshold are averaged to produce the first prediction feature. The second prediction feature is calculated by dividing the luminance pixels of the RLSE luminance-chrominance digital image into four strips and calculating the average the maximum pixel value from each of the four strips. Other prediction features that have proved to be useful are the average pixel value and the 90% cumulative histogram pixel value.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">After the brightness balance value of the RLSE digital image has been calculated, the color cast of the RLSE digital image is calculated that can be used to remove an overall color cast. The principle causes of color casts are variation in the color of the source illumination and secondarily the color fidelity of the image sensor that recorded the original digital image. A color balance position is calculated for the RLSE digital image which represents the chrominance coordinates of a theoretical color-neutral scene reflector. The color balance position is calculated using a two dimensional Gaussian weighting surface applied to the chrominance pixel data of the RLSE luminance-chrominance digital image. Although the chrominance pixel data can be averaged in an unweighted manner, better results have been obtained using the two dimensional Gaussian weighting surface. This is principally due to the de-emphasis of highly colorful scene objects from the calculation. A balance look-up-table is calculated for each color of the RLSE digital image using the calculated color balance position and the brightness balance value. The balance look-up-table is applied to the RLSE digital image to produce the source digital image for the tone scale module <b>330</b>. As a result of the application of the balance look-up-table, pixel values in the RLSE digital image that have a value equal to the predicted balance value are transformed to a value equal to a system defined reference gray point. Similarly, pixels with corresponding chrominance values that correspond to the color balance position will be transformed to a color neutral position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">It should be noted that it is also possible to combine the operation of the lightness balance procedure described above with the construction of the tone scale function described in later detail below. The lightness balance operation is equivalent to adjusting the reference gray point used in the construction of the tone scale function. If the lightness balance operation is combined with the construction of the tone scale function, the reference gray point is image dependent since the pixels of the digital image being processed are used to calculate the reference gray point.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">The rendering module <b>340</b> accepts the enhanced digital image from the tone scale module <b>330</b> and prepares the pixel data for display on an output image device. The rendering module <b>340</b> performs a color transformation, a tonal rendering transformation, and an output encoding transformation. The pixel data must be transformed such that the pixel data representing different original scene colors are appropriate for the color spectral characteristics associated with the output image device. This can be accomplished in a multiple step procedure. First the RLSE representation pixel data of the enhanced digital image is transformed into a linear representation. Next a color matrix transform is applied to the linear representation pixel data. The color matrix can be a 3 by 3 element matrix wherein the elements of the matrix are determined by analyzing a collection of imaged color patch targets and measuring the resultant color produced with the intended output image device.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">The other task includes the transformation of the pixel data from the linear or relative-log-scene-exposure representation to a rendered representation with the application of a rendering function R(x). In general, the dynamic range of the enhanced digital image is much larger than can be displayed on typical output image devices such as CRT monitors or photographic paper. Therefore, if the pixel data of the enhanced digital image were received by the output image device directly, much of the pixel data would be clipped in the extreme light and dark parts of the image with a substantial loss of spatial detail. The rendering function performs a graceful roll-off of the pixel data such that the processed pixel data when displayed will result in a gradual loss of spatial detail as pixel values approach the limits of the output image device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">The present invention can be used with many different mathematical forms for the rendering function such as a rendering function produced with the method disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,300,381 by Buhr et al. In general, optimal results are obtained using rendering functions that have a sigmoid shape, i.e., rendering functions having a zero or near slope for extreme input pixel values and having a maximum magnitude slope that is achieved for mid-tone input values. Some rendering functions can have a relatively high slope for the darkest domain of input pixel values but almost all rendering functions have a zero or near zero slope characteristic for the lightest domain of pixel values. The rendering function, to an extent, mimics the photo response characteristics of photographic paper used in analog imaging applications.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">Although it is possible to use a rendering function that is dependent on the digital image being processed, the preferred embodiment of the present invention uses a sigmoid shaped rendering function that is independent of the digital image. Image dependent modification to the digital image being processed is performed by the tone scale module <b>330</b> prior to the application of the rendering function. Thus, the tone scale module <b>330</b> is responsible for scene dependent changes to the image content while the rendering module <b>340</b> is responsible for preparing the final processed image for an image output device.</p>

Point <b>597</b> indicates the point on the rendering function for which the instantaneous slope has a maximum magnitude which does not necessarily coincide with the reference gray point <b>591</b>. The point of maximum magnitude slope is also the inflection point of the sigmoid function, i.e. a local maximum or minimum in the corresponding slope function of the rendering function R(x). The example rendering function shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>is appropriate for a digital imaging system that uses a 12-bit pixel value representation for processing digital images.

<p id="p-0057" num="0060">The example rendering function shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>is typical for use with a digital printer that produces digital photographic prints. The output pixel value scale shown can relate to photographic paper densities, e.g. the digital printer can be calibrated such that each pixel code value is equal to 100 times the optical density that will be produced on the print. However, the present invention can also be used with electronic display devices. A typical rendering function for use with an electronic display device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>as indicated by curve <b>598</b>.

<p id="p-0058" num="0061">The last operation performed by the rendering module <b>340</b> is the encoding of the output pixel values for use with an output image device.

<p id="p-0060" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the chain of image processing modules is designed to work well with or without the inclusion of the tone scale module <b>330</b>. The scene balance module <b>320</b> accommodates exposure and illumination system variability. The rendering module <b>340</b> prepares the image data for viewing on an output image device. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the digital image processor <b>20</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> without the use of the tone scale module <b>330</b> will yield acceptable photographic results. That is, the contrast, lightness, and color reproduction of the system are set for optimal photographic results for the majority of typical digital images. The inclusion of the tone scale module <b>330</b> enhances the appearance of the processed digital images such that digital images that deviate from the norm, in terms of dynamic range, will be tonally enhanced and digital images that are at the norm for the system will be unaltered by the tone scale module <b>330</b>. For a typical implementation of the present invention, the dynamic range of the original digital images <b>101</b> (ratio of corresponding original scene intensities based on the extremes of the image) is approximately 64 to 1. The enhanced digital images corresponding to processed original digital images <b>101</b> that have approximately a 64 to 1 dynamic range will be little affected by the tone scale module <b>330</b>. Conversely, the enhanced digital images corresponding to processed original digital images <b>101</b> that have a dynamic range greater than 64 to 1 and less than 64 to 1 can be significantly enhanced by the tone scale module <b>330</b>, i.e. rendered with more detail and more color saturation.

The pedestal generation module <b>410</b> receives the digital image to be processed denoted by the input digital image <b>401</b> and produces the pedestal digital image <b>403</b>. The pedestal generation module <b>410</b> employs a spatial filter, applied to the input digital image <b>401</b>, that removes texture from the input digital image <b>401</b> but leaves edge information. In the context of the present invention, texture refers to image content including fine spatial detail and spatial shading structure. As a natural consequence of the filter, noise is also removed. Thus the pedestal digital image <b>403</b> is a highly smoothed version of the input digital image <b>401</b> with much of the edge content of the input digital image <b>401</b>. The pedestal digital image <b>403</b> is subtracted from the input digital image <b>401</b> by the difference module <b>420</b> resulting in the texture digital image <b>402</b>. It will be appreciated that all of the information of the input digital image <b>401</b> is contained in either the pedestal digital image <b>403</b> or the texture digital image <b>402</b>. The tone scale pedestal applicator <b>430</b> applies the tone scale function <b>203</b> to the pedestal digital image <b>403</b> resulting in the tone adjusted digital image <b>407</b>. Therefore, the tonal characteristics of the pedestal digital image <b>403</b> are enhanced by the application of the tone scale function <b>203</b> without affecting the texture content of the input digital image <b>401</b>. The addition module <b>440</b> combines the tone adjusted digital image <b>407</b> with the texture digital image <b>402</b> to produce the output digital image <b>409</b>. Therefore, the output digital image <b>409</b> is a tone scale enhanced version of the input digital image <b>401</b> that has the texture image structure content of the input digital image <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">Applying a tone scale function by using a spatial filter is particularly advantageous when the tone scale function is highly compressive. When highly compressive tone scale functions are applied directly to an input digital image, the tonal characteristics will be enhanced but the texture image structure can be diminished in magnitude. Using a spatial filter to apply the tone scale function can achieve the desired tone scale enhancement while maintaining the texture image structure. A variety of spatial filters can be used to achieve an improved result. The present invention uses the spatial filter disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,317,521 by Gallagher and Gindele which employs the use of a control, or masking, signal to preserve the edges in the pedestal digital image <b>403</b>. The present invention can also be used with a similar method disclosed by Lee in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,798. Another spatial filter that can be employed is a simple low-pass filter, such as a two dimensional Gaussian filter. However, if a low-pass filter is used, the dimension of the Gaussian standard deviation parameter should be very large, e.g. one quarter of the dimension of the digital image being processed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">It should also be noted that for mildly compressive tone scale functions it may not be necessary to use a spatial filter. Thus the tone scale function applicator <b>240</b> can apply the tone scale function <b>203</b> directly to the pixels of the input digital image <b>401</b> to produce the output digital image <b>409</b>. It should also be noted that for expansive tone scale functions, the direct application of the tone scale function <b>203</b> to the input digital image <b>401</b> can result in a greater level of tonal enhancement than if a spatial filter is used as described above. This is principally due to the amplification of image texture resulting from the expansive tone scale function. However, for some digital images the amplification of image texture can be a detriment to image quality if the image texture also contains high levels of noise. Therefore, applying the tone scale function <b>203</b> with a spatial filter as described above can be an advantage for both compressive and expansive tone scale functions.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">The tone scale function generator <b>230</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is described in more detail hereinbelow. The tone scale function generator <b>230</b> can be used in either an automatic mode, wherein the tone scale function <b>203</b> is calculated using the pixels of the analysis digital image <b>201</b>, or in a manual mode, wherein the tone scale function <b>203</b> is calculated using user input selections <b>231</b> provided via a graphical user interface. For either mode, the mathematical formulation for the calculations is the same.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">The tone scale function <b>203</b>, is a single valued function, i.e. one output pixel value for each input pixel value, defined for the range of pixels values in the source digital image <b>102</b>. The shape of the tone scale function <b>203</b> is an important aspect of the present invention since the mathematical shape determines the effect on the processed digital images. The present invention constructs the tone scale function <b>203</b> from at least two function segments wherein no two function segments share more than one input pixel value in common. The preferred embodiment of the present invention uses two function segments and defines a reference gray point pixel value corresponding to an 18% scene reflector as the input pixel value in common that divides the function domain into the two tone scale segments. The function segment relating to the brighter image regions, i.e. image regions corresponding to bright regions of the original photographed scene, is called the highlight tone scale segment. The function segment relating to the darker image regions, i.e. image regions corresponding to dim regions of the original photographed scene, is called the shadow tone scale segment. It should be noted that the tone scale function <b>203</b> is a continuous function insofar as the implementation in computer software and/or hardware will allow. It should also be noted that the tone scale function <b>203</b> can have a continuous first derivative. However, although desirable, the property of a continuous first derivative is not a requirement of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">The pixel polarity of a digital image used in a digital imaging system is an arbitrary decision made by the system architect. For example, positive pixel polarity digital images have pixels wherein higher numerical values relate to more light having been received. Conversely, negative pixel polarity digital images have pixels wherein higher numerical values relate to less light having been received. The present invention can be used with digital images of either pixel polarity. However, in the interest of clarity, the following description will assume a positive pixel polarity convention. Those skilled in the art will recognize that references made to the increasing or decreasing function slope values are with respect to positive pixel polarity digital images. The description of function slope characteristics must be reversed for systems using negative pixel polarity digital images. This is an important aspect of interpretation since mathematically an increasing or decreasing function is defined with respect to numerically increasing abscissa values. For example, in the description of the construction of the highlight and shadow component functions given hereinbelow, some shadow component functions are described as having a monotonically increasing slope property while some highlight component functions are described as having a monotonically decreasing slope property. This description is with regard to a positive pixel polarity convention. For a negative pixel polarity convention, the equivalent shadow component functions would be described as having a monotonically decreasing slope property while the equivalent highlight component functions would be described as having a monotonically increasing slope property. Similarly, for a positive pixel polarity convention, the tone scale function has a slope function that is always greater than or equal to zero. Conversely, or a negative pixel polarity convention, the tone scale function can have a slope function that is always less than or equal to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">The highlight and shadow tone scale segments can each be constructed using two or more component functions. The combined effect of multiple component functions results in a tone scale segment that has at least one inflection point within the range of input pixel values. An inflection point can best be understood by examining the slope function of a tone scale segment. For an inflection point to occur, the corresponding slope function must achieve a local minimum or maximum. Both the highlight and shadow tone scale segments can achieve an inflection. It is also possible for one of the tone scale segments to achieve an inflection point while the other tone scale segment does not. As will be described in more detail hereinbelow, it is also possible for one tone scale segment to achieve more than one inflection point.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">The highlight tone scale segment can be constructed from one or more component functions some of which satisfy the following constraints: 1) the component function can have a monotonically decreasing slope function for all input pixel values equal to or greater than the reference gray point, and 2) the component function can have a monotonically increasing function value for all input pixel values equal to or greater than the reference gray point and less than or equal to a maximum input pixel value expressed in the digital image. A function is monotonic over a given domain if the function does not have a reversal of its first derivative function (for digital implementations the slope function is taken as a reasonable approximation of the first derivative function). It should also be noted that the function characteristics for input pixel values greater than what is expressed in a particular image is an academic issue since no pixels will be affected. Both of the above mentioned constraints are important and require some explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0076">The highlight tone scale segment relates to the bright pixels, i.e. pixels relating to more light having been received. In general, for high dynamic range digital images the corresponding rendered digital images produced without the present invention have little or no spatial detail in the very brightest image regions. This is a consequence of the overall high system contrast required to pleasingly render digital images of average dynamic range. Therefore, for high dynamic range digital images some of the image content contained in the bright pixels cannot be rendered such that spatial detail modulation is preserved in the rendered digital image <b>103</b>. Improved spatial detail modulation can be achieved if the tone scale function <b>203</b> maps high input pixel values to lower output pixel values. This results in processed digital images with darker highlight content in the resultant rendered digital image <b>103</b>. There are many functions that can perform such an input to output mapping operation. However, monotonically increasing functions have been experimentally determined to be more robust, i.e. produce fewer image artifacts, than functions that are not monotonic.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0077">While many monotonic functions can achieve the operation of mapping high input pixel values to lower output pixel values, all functions impose some form of compromise in contrast with regard to image regions corresponding to different average pixel values. In particular, the instantaneous slope value (first derivative) of the component functions used to construct the highlight tone scale segment can significantly affect the perception of contrast and spatial detail modulation in the resultant rendered digital image <b>103</b>. Therefore, the highlight tone scale segment constructed using component functions having a monotonically decreasing instantaneous slope value can improve the rendering of spatial detail modulation for bright image regions by mapping highlight pixels to lower output pixel values. Image regions corresponding to higher instantaneous slope values within the domain of the highlight tone scale segment tend to preserve more image detail modulation. Thus the monotonically decreasing instantaneous slope condition advantages image content corresponding to pixel values that are numerically closer in value to the reference gray point. In general, important image content, such as the main subject region, tends to be numerically closer to the reference gray point while background image content tends to be exhibited more uniformly with regard to pixel values.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0078">Similarly, the shadow tone scale segment can be constructed from one or more component functions some of which satisfy the following constraints: 1) the component function can have a monotonically increasing slope function for all input pixel values equal to or less than the reference gray point, and 2) the component function can have a monotonically increasing function value for all input pixel values equal to or less than the reference gray point and greater than or equal to a minimum input pixel value expressed in the digital image. Similarly, the monotonicity property of the component functions used to construct the shadow tone scale segment relates to more robust image quality results. The monotonically increasing slope function property of the component functions used to construct the shadow tone scale segment is similarly important since this condition also advantages image content corresponding to pixel values that are numerically closer in value to the reference gray point. For high dynamic range images, the monotonically increasing slope function property of the component functions used to construct the shadow tone scale segment achieves a low input pixel value to higher output pixel value mapping operation. This results in processed digital images with lighter shadow content in the resultant rendered digital image <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0079">A natural consequence of the above mentioned slope function constraints produces tone scale functions that have high slope function values at the reference gray point. Therefore the choice of the reference gray point value is important since it determines which regions in images will experience high slope function values. A reference gray point value corresponding to an 18% gray scene reflector is chosen since it represents approximately the midpoint of perceptual lightness. Other choices for the value of the reference gray point can also produce excellent results. Reasonable values for the reference gray point range from a 10% scene reflector value to a 25% scene reflector value.</p>

Tone scale functions having continuous slope function are, in general, desirable. However, experimentation has shown that the discontinuity in the slope function of a tone scale function when applied to digital images relating to natural photographed scenes is not often a problem. Other methods for generating tone scale functions, such as described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,798 have imposed a continuity of slope constraint on the process of construction. The experimentation performed in support of the present invention has found that the continuity of slope constraint can be unnecessarily restrictive for some digital imaging applications. By not imposing the continuity of slope constraint, a greater diversity of useful tone scale functions can be produced. In particular, tone scale functions that are constructed in a manner responsive to the pixels of the source digital image when applied to the source digital image can achieve a greater level of overall contrast enhancement.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0091">A highlight component function constructed with expressions (4), (6), or (13), for the case in which x<sub>ho </sub>is less than x<sub>w</sub>, will result in a function that has a montonically increasing instantaneous slope. An example of such a function is depicted as curve <b>530</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>. While the function indicated by curve <b>530</b> satisfies the mapping of input pixel value x<sub>ho </sub>to output pixel value x<sub>w</sub>, a tone scale function based on such a function can produce some unnatural looking images. This is mainly due to the fact that the slope of the highlight component function depicted by curve <b>530</b> has a slope that is monotonically increasing, not monotonically decreasing, for the input pixel range near the reference gray point. However, a highlight component function can be constructed using the expressions (4), (6), or (13), reflected about the line indicated as line <b>531</b> given by (25) for input pixel values greater than or equal to the reference gray point (indicated by point <b>533</b>).

The function produced by the reflection process, as indicated by curve <b>532</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>, is a monontonically increasing function with a monotonically decreasing instantaneous slope. The functional form of the expansive highlight component function is calculated by the following steps. First the expression (4), (6), or (13) is solved using the constraint x<sub>ho</sub>=x<sub>w </sub>to determine the numerical constant &#x3b1;<sub>h1</sub>. In the second step, a first rotation transform is applied to a coordinate pair (x,&#x192;(x)) resulting in a transformed coordinate pair (u,v) as given by (26)

The first rotation transform is designed to transform the line described by expression (24) into the x-axis.

The highlight tone scale segment so constructed consists of three input pixel domains. The first domain extends from the reference gray point x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub> to a point defined by the variable x<sub>hc</sub>. This first domain is constructed entirely from the first highlight component function &#x192;<sub>h1</sub>(x). The second domain is constructed using a blend of the first and second highlight component functions and extends from point x<sub>hc </sub>to the extreme highlight point x<sub>he</sub>. The third shadow domain is constructed for the region for input pixel values greater than the value of x<sub>he</sub>. As input pixel values increase, denoted here by the variable x, approach x<sub>he</sub>, the highlight tone scale segment approaches the value of the second highlight component function &#x192;<sub>h2</sub>(x). Highlight tone scale segments constructed using expressions (44) can produce an inflection point in the function shape for some input pixel value x within the range from x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub> to x<sub>he</sub>. That is, the slope of the highlight tone scale segment has a local minimum within the range from x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub> to x<sub>he</sub>. Thus the slope of the highlight tone scale segment produced with this embodiment is not necessarily a monotonically decreasing function over the range from x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub> to x<sub>he </sub>even though each component function is a monotonically decreasing function. However, the slope of the highlight tone scale segment produced with this embodiment is a monotonically decreasing function over the range from x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub> to x<sub>hc</sub>, i.e. the range of input pixel values that includes the intersection of the highlight and shadow tone scale segments. It is also possible, for this embodiment of the construction method, that the slope of the highlight tone scale segment be greater than 1.0 for the input pixel value domain in the vicinity of x<sub>he</sub>. This feature tends to maintain the appearance of specular highlights as bright spots even though the highlight tone scale segment is a compressive function, i.e. the range of input pixel values (x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub> to x<sub>he</sub>) is larger than the range of output pixel values (x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub> to x<sub>we</sub>).

<p id="p-0099" num="0102">In similar fashion, a shadow tone scale segment which achieves an inflection point can be constructed using more than one shadow component function. In another embodiment, a second shadow component function is constructed using the same functional form as expression (7) constrained to pass through the a specified coordinate point defined by an abscissa value x<sub>se </sub>that results in a function value x<sub>be </sub>as given by (46).

This constraint achieves an extreme shadow black point mapping objective relating to the darkest part of the processed digital image. For the second shadow component function, the black point value x<sub>be </sub>is predetermined based on the pixel value that is mapped by the rendering function R(x) to correspond to a black paper density of approximately 2.3, i.e. the maximum paper achievable paper density. The variable &#x3b1;<sub>s2 </sub>can be solved using the iterative numerical solution described above. The second shadow component function is described by expression (47).

The shadow tone scale segment so constructed consists of three input pixel domains. The first domain extends from a point defined by the variable x<sub>sc </sub>to the reference gray point x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub>. This first shadow domain is constructed entirely from the first shadow component function &#x192;<sub>s1</sub>(x). The second shadow domain is constructed using a blend of the first and second shadow component functions and extends from the extreme shadow point x<sub>se </sub>to the point x<sub>sc</sub>. The third shadow domain is constructed for the region for input pixel values less than the value of x<sub>se</sub>. As input pixel values decrease, denoted here by the variable x, approach x<sub>se</sub>, the shadow tone scale segment approaches the value of the second shadow component function &#x192;<sub>s2</sub>(x). Shadow tone scale segments constructed using expressions (48) can produce an inflection point in the function shape for some input pixel value x within the range from x<sub>se </sub>to x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub>. That is, the slope of the shadow tone scale segment has a local minimum within the range from x<sub>se </sub>to x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub>. Thus the slope of the shadow tone scale segment produced with this embodiment is not a monotonically increasing function over the range from x<sub>se </sub>to x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub> even though each component function is a monotonically increasing function. However, slope of the shadow tone scale segment produced with this embodiment is a monotonically increasing function over the range from x<sub>sc </sub>to x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub>, i.e. the range of input pixel values that includes the intersection of the highlight and shadow tone scale segments. It is also possible for this embodiment of the construction method that the slope of the shadow tone scale segment be greater than 1.0 for the input pixel value domain in the vicinity of x<sub>se</sub>. This feature tends to maintain the appearance of deep shadows as very dark regions even though the shadow tone scale segment is a compressive function, i.e. the range of input pixel values (x<sub>se </sub>to x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub>) is larger than the range of output pixel values (x<sub>be </sub>to x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub>).

<p id="p-0100" num="0103">An example graph of the tone scale function <b>203</b> constructed using a highlight and tone scale segment each having been constructed from two component functions is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a</i>. The identity mapping one-to-one input pixel value-to-output pixel value line is indicated by line <b>560</b> and the reference gray point is indicated by point <b>561</b>. The first, second, and third input pixel domains described above for the highlight tone scale segment are indicated by domains <b>562</b>, <b>563</b>, and <b>564</b> respectively. The abscissa and ordinate values for point <b>565</b> are the variables x<sub>he </sub>and x<sub>we </sub>respectively. The abscissa value for point <b>566</b> is the variable x<sub>he</sub>. The first, second, and third input pixel domains described above for the shadow tone scale segment are indicated by domains <b>567</b>, <b>568</b>, and <b>569</b> respectively. The abscissa and ordinate values for point <b>570</b> are the variables x<sub>se </sub>and x<sub>be </sub>respectively. The abscissa value for point <b>571</b> is the variable x<sub>sc</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0104">The third highlight domain indicated by domain <b>564</b> relates to pixels with values greater than the variable x<sub>he</sub>. As will be described in more detail below, this domain of input pixel values relates to the brightest 0.1% pixels. Therefore, the shape of the third highlight domain really only affects a very small portion of the image area. The same argument can be made for the third shadow domain indicated by domain <b>569</b> relating to pixels with values less than the variable x<sub>se</sub>. Another approach for determining the shape of the third highlight domain that would produce acceptable results is to use the instantaneous slope of the tone scale function at the point <b>566</b> to project a straight line from point <b>566</b>. Similarly, the instantaneous slope of the tone scale function at the point <b>570</b> can be used to project a straight line from point <b>570</b> for the third shadow domain.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b </i>shows the tone scale function <b>203</b> and its corresponding slope function. The identity mapping one-to-one input pixel value-to-output pixel value line is indicated by line <b>573</b> and the reference gray point is indicated by point <b>574</b>. The tone scale function <b>203</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b </i>as curve <b>575</b>. Several features of the slope function shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b </i>are noteworthy. Point <b>579</b> indicates the slope function at the abscissa value equal to the reference gray point. The slope function is nearly discontinuous at the reference gray point and achieves a local maximum value at the reference gray point. The tone scale function <b>203</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>therefore has an inflection point at the abscissa value equal to the reference gray point since the corresponding slope function has a local maximum at the reference gray point. Point <b>577</b> indicates a local minimum of the slope function within the input pixel domain corresponding to the highlight tone scale segment. Thus the tone scale function <b>203</b> constructed with two highlight component functions can have an inflection point within the input pixel domain of the highlight tone scale segment. Similarly, point <b>578</b> indicates a local minimum of the slope function within the input pixel domain corresponding to the shadow tone scale segment. Thus the tone scale function <b>203</b> constructed with two shadow component functions can have an inflection point within the input pixel domain of the shadow tone scale segment.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0106">The slope function shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b </i>(indicated by curve <b>580</b>) is shown in isolation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>c </i>as indicated by curve <b>580</b> with the scale of the graph indicating the magnitude for the slope function. Thus it can be seen that the value of the slope function, which indicates the instantaneous slope of the tone scale function, is never negative, i.e. the tone scale function is a monotonic function. The tone scale function shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>is compressive for both the highlight and shadow tone scale segments. Thus the average value of the corresponding slope function depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>c </i>is less than 1.0. The inflection points for the highlight and shadow tone scale segments are indicated as points <b>577</b> and <b>578</b> respectively. (These points are also indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b</i>.) The slope function achieves a relatively high value in the extreme highlight domain indicated by domain <b>581</b>. The magnitude of the slope function in the domain <b>581</b> is about the same as the magnitude of the slope function for the mid-tone domain near the indicated point <b>579</b>. The extreme shadow domain indicated by domain <b>582</b> achieves a slope which is higher even higher in magnitude. Therefore, the tone scale function depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>achieves a relatively high slope at the reference gray point and within the extreme highlight and extreme shadow domains as well.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0107">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pixels of the source digital image, i.e. the input digital image to the tone scale module <b>330</b>, can be used to determine the variables x<sub>ho </sub>and x<sub>so </sub>and thus determine the shape of the tone scale function. The analysis image generator <b>250</b> receives the source digital image and produces an analysis digital image <b>201</b> by applying a low-pass spatial filter and performing a sampling operation. The result is a lower spatial resolution version of the source digital image that has fewer pixels representing the same image content. Typical spatial resolutions for the analysis digital image <b>201</b> is approximately 64 by 96 pixels. The analysis digital image is also converted to be in a luminance-chrominance representation using expression (1).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0108">The tone scale function generator <b>230</b> calculates the tone scale function <b>203</b> by analyzing the pixels of the analysis digital image <b>201</b>. A pixel histogram function, i.e. a frequency of occurrence function, is calculated from the pixels of the luminance digital image channel of the analysis digital image <b>201</b>. A cumulative histogram function is calculated from the pixel histogram function by integrating the values of the pixel histogram as a function of pixel value. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a graph of a example histogram function indicated by curve <b>601</b> and its corresponding cumulative histogram function indicated by curve <b>602</b>. The cumulative histogram function is scaled between 0.0 and 1.0 and relates to the percentage area of the digital image with 1.0 corresponding to 100 percent of image area. The ordinate value of the cumulative histogram function relates to a given percentage image area Z. The corresponding abscissa value relates to the pixel value P for which the percentage of pixels in the image that have values less than P is given by Z. The 99.0% cumulative histogram function value is used to determine the value of the highlight point, variable x<sub>ho</sub>. The 1.0% cumulative histogram function value is used to determine the value of the shadow point, variable x<sub>so</sub>. The values for the variables x<sub>ho </sub>and x<sub>so </sub>are indicated as points <b>603</b> and <b>604</b> respectively on the graph shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0109">For the embodiment described above for which two highlight component functions are used to construct the highlight tone scale segment, the pixels of the source digital image can also be used to set the value of variable x<sub>he</sub>. The 99.9% cumulative histogram function value is used to determine the value of the extreme highlight point, variable x<sub>he</sub>. Similarly, for the embodiment described above for which two shadow component functions are used to the construct the shadow tone scale segment, the extreme shadow point variable x<sub>se </sub>is determined using the 0.1% cumulative histogram function value. The values for the variables x<sub>he </sub>and x<sub>se </sub>are indicated as points <b>605</b> and <b>606</b> respectively on the graph shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention can be used with cumulative histogram percentile values other than the above mentioned values for the variables x<sub>so</sub>, x<sub>ho</sub>, x<sub>he</sub>, and x<sub>se </sub>and still derive the benefits of the present invention. For optimum results, the variables x<sub>so </sub>and x<sub>ho </sub>should relate to relatively dark and light scene objects respectively and the variables x<sub>se </sub>and x<sub>he </sub>should relate to extremely dark and light scene objects respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0110">While the present invention uses the cumulative histogram function of image pixel values to determine variables x<sub>so</sub>, x<sub>ho</sub>, x<sub>he</sub>, and x<sub>se</sub>, masked cumulative histogram functions of image pixel values can also be used. For example, a spatial activity filter can be operated on the digital image to be processed and compared to a threshold value to produce an image mask. The image mask represents pixels that are included in the masked cumulative histogram function.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0111">Other functions than the exponential functions described above can be used to generate the highlight and shadow component functions.

<p id="p-0114" num="0117">It should be noted that many other functions in the general class of sigmoid functions can be used to generate the highlight and shadow component functions. A sigmoid shaped function refers herein to a function with the following properties: the first derivative of the function approaches a value of zero at the minimum and maximum values of the input domain, the function does not have a zero first derivative value between the minimum and maximum values of the input domain, and the function is either monotonically increasing or decreasing over the input domain. An important aspect of using a sigmoid shaped function for the highlight and shadow component functions is the independence of the two component functions. Therefore, a first sigmoid shaped function can be used for the highlight component function and a second sigmoid shaped function for the shadow component function. Although the sigmoid shaped function for the two component functions can have the same functional form, the first and second sigmoid shaped functions must have different control parameters otherwise the two sigmoid shaped functions would constitute a single sigmoid function. It will also be appreciated that tone scale functions constructed with two sigmoid shaped functions as described above will have a monotonically increasing slope for input pixel values below the reference gray point and have a monotonically decreasing slope for input pixel values above the reference gray point.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0118">An important feature of the present invention is the use of two tone scale segments for constructing a tone scale function. Another important feature is the use of mathematical functions for constructing the two tone scale segments. In particular, a different mathematical function is used for the highlight tone scale segment than for the shadow tone scale segment. In the context of the present invention, different mathematical functions can share the same mathematical equation, i.e. the same mathematical combination of variables, however, the values of the control variables for the different mathematical functions must be different. For example, the highlight and shadow component function of expressions (13) and (14) respectively share the same mathematical equation but have different values for the control variable &#x3b1; denoted by &#x3b1;<sub>h1 </sub>and &#x3b1;<sub>s1 </sub>and are therefore considered different mathematical functions.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0119">When the expressions (19) or (22) are used to construct a highlight or shadow tone scale segments respectively with just a single component function, the &#x3c6;<sub>h </sub>and &#x3c6;<sub>s </sub>variables can be selected independently. When the &#x3c6;<sub>h </sub>variable is selected to be 1.0, the highlight tone scale segment is described by a linear function. Similarly, when the &#x3c6;<sub>s </sub>variable is selected to be 1.0, the shadow tone scale segment is described by a linear function. The present invention preferably selects the values of the &#x3c6;<sub>h </sub>and &#x3c6;<sub>s </sub>variables to be 0.5. However, for some digital imaging system applications and depending on individual people's preferences, the values of the &#x3c6;<sub>h </sub>and &#x3c6;<sub>s </sub>variables can be selected to be 1.0 and yield very good results. This is largely due to the combination of the image independent sigmoid shaped rendering function R(x) employed by the rendering module <b>340</b> with the image dependent tone scale function <b>203</b> employed by the tone scale module <b>330</b>. The use of the sigmoid shaped rendering function R(x) provides the graceful roll-off of pixel values at both extremes (light and dark extremes) that yields a photographically acceptable appearance to the processed digital images. With the variables &#x3c6;<sub>h </sub>and &#x3c6;<sub>s </sub>set to values less than 1.0, the constructed tone scale function <b>203</b> also achieves the property of a graceful roll-off of pixel values at both extremes. Therefore, another important feature of the present invention is the combination use of a sigmoid shaped image independent function with an image dependent two segment tone scale function.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0120">Although the above description of the construction of the tone scale function has treated the underlying functions as continuous mathematical entities, those skilled in the art will recognize that for digital imaging applications, any function must be approximated by discrete values. Therefore, when implemented in a digital computer, the tone scale function <b>203</b> is actually represented by a collection of discrete values. The present invention uses a look-up-table to implement and store the tone scale function. To within the limits of a digital representation will allow, the tone scale function <b>203</b> is continuous. However, the tone scale function <b>203</b> can also be represented as a series of line segments wherein the points defining the line segments are determined using the mathematical functions described above. The main advantage of the method of using a series of line segment saves computation resources by using a linear interpolation method to generate the tone scale function points of the line segments.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0121">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the tone scale function generator <b>230</b> can accept user input selections <b>231</b> in the generation of the tone scale function <b>203</b>. For example a user of the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can view possible selections and/or control parameters on the monitor device <b>50</b> and indicate selections using the input control device <b>60</b> such as a keyboard or mouse pointing device. When used in this manual user mode, a highlight control parameter and a shadow control parameter are used to change the shape of the component functions that are used to generate the highlight tone scale segment and shadow tone scale segment respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0122">In a preferred embodiment for this manual mode of operation, expressions (44) and (48) are used to construct the highlight and shadow tone scale segments respectively. First the variables x<sub>ho</sub>, x<sub>he</sub>, x<sub>so </sub>and x<sub>se </sub>are determined automatically using the cumulative histogram values derived from the pixels of the source digital image <b>102</b>. Next the variables &#x3b1;<sub>h1</sub>, &#x3b1;<sub>h2</sub>, &#x3b1;<sub>s1</sub>, and &#x3b1;<sub>s2 </sub>are determined by the iterative numerical solution described above. The tone scale function <b>203</b> is constructed from the highlight and shadow tone scale segments. Next the tone scale function <b>203</b> is applied to the source digital image <b>102</b> using the spatial filtering method described above. The user of the system views the resultant rendered digital image <b>103</b> either by viewing a photographic print generated with the processed digital image or by viewing the processed digital image on an electronic display device. After having analyzed the viewed image, the user can then indicate preferences as to the lightness of the shadow regions of the viewed image and the lightness of the highlight regions of the viewed image. The user makes selections by using the mouse pointing device with options having been displayed on an electronic display device via a graphical user interface. The user input selections <b>231</b> are used by the software implementation to change a highlight control parameter &#x394;<sub>h </sub>and a shadow control parameter &#x394;<sub>s</sub>. The highlight and shadow control parameters are then used to modify the highlight and shadow tone scale segments of the tone scale function <b>203</b>.</p>

A modified tone scale function is constructed using the recalculated highlight and shadow tone scale segments. The modified tone scale function is then re-applied to the source digital image <b>102</b> and the resultant rendered digital image <b>103</b> is displayed on the electronic display device.
</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0124">In an alternative embodiment of the manual user mode of operation, the highlight and shadow tone scale segments are set to defaults such that the tone scale function <b>203</b> assumes the identity mapping one-to-one input-to-output line shape. The user views a rendered digital image <b>103</b> on the electronic display device that essentially has not been enhanced to change its tone scale characteristics. The user then makes selections, as described above, to effect a change in the shadow and highlight lightness characteristics of the viewed image.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0125">Having a tone scale segment with two inflection points can be advantageous for digital images that have, for at least a portion of the image area, pixels that relate to a no exposure condition. For example, digital images derived by scanning a photographic film strip can have image regions that correspond to photographic film densities that are indistinguishable from having received no light. These image regions have pixel values that correspond to the minimum film density. The minimum film density values can be obtained by scanning the inter-frame gap between adjacent image frames. A minimum density value is obtained as R<sub>min</sub>, G<sub>min</sub>, and B<sub>min </sub>for the red, green, and blue digital image channel pixel data. These minimum density values are used to construct a third shadow component function. The resultant shadow tone scale segment exhibits two distinct inflection points.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0126">The third shadow component function is calculated using a Gaussian function that maps pixel values corresponding to the minimum film density to the maximum achievable paper density (this is approximately a value of 2.3 as given in the example described above). Although the second shadow component function can also map the pixel values corresponding to the minimum film density to the maximum achievable paper density, the third shadow component function maps a greater range of pixel values to the maximum achievable paper density. This property of the third shadow component function ensures that any noise associated with the minimum film density response is also mapped to the maximum achievable paper density. It should also be noted that the minimum film density relates to a condition of receiving no light. Therefore, the third shadow component function achieves a strategy of mapping a response value that relates to a condition of having received no light to a maximum paper density.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0127">First a black level (denoted by the variable x<sub>BLK</sub>) is calculated as the average of the variables R<sub>min</sub>, G<sub>min</sub>, and B<sub>min</sub>. plus a margin for noise given by the expression (61).

The variable &#x3c3;<sub>N </sub>represents the noise standard deviation as measured in the pixel value range corresponding to the film minimum density. (This quantity can also be measured from pixels within the inter-frame gaps.) The variable &#x3b1;<sub>N </sub>represents a noise magnitude scaling factor that is set based on the level of noise suppression desired and is preferable set to a value of between 1.0 and 2.0.

<p id="p-0126" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows an example tone scale function (curve <b>609</b>) generated with the present invention. The highlight tone scale segment has two inflection points shown by points <b>613</b> and <b>611</b>. The corresponding slope function, indicated by curve <b>610</b>, has a local slope minimum and maximum indicated by points <b>614</b> and <b>612</b> that correspond to function points <b>613</b> and <b>611</b> respectively. The shadow tone scale segment has three inflection points indicated by points <b>623</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>619</b>, and <b>617</b>. The corresponding slope function has a local slope minimum indicated by points <b>622</b> and <b>618</b> that correspond to function points <b>621</b> and <b>617</b> respectively. The slope function has a local slope maximum indicated by points <b>624</b> and <b>620</b> that correspond to function points <b>623</b> and <b>619</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0130">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the tone scale function, indicated by curve <b>609</b>, also achieves an inflection point where the two tone scale segments meet, i.e. at the point indicated by <b>615</b>. The corresponding tone scale function, curve <b>610</b>, has a local maximum as indicated by point <b>616</b>. The shape of the highlight and shadow tone scale segments can be independently selected. Therefore, the tone scale function shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is an example of a tone scale function that achieves an inflection point constructed from two independently controllable tone scale segments.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0131">An important feature of the tone scale functions produced with the method of the present invention is the occurrence of inflection points within the domain of a tone scale function. The present invention generates a tone scale function from two connected tone scale segments each of which can independently have at least one characteristic inflection point. Inflection points are caused by a change in the local slope characteristics of a tone scale function. These changes in the corresponding slope function are generally a consequence of the black and white point mapping constraints applied and the choice of functions used in the tone scale function construction. In particular, the inflection point exhibited within the highlight tone scale segment is a consequence of imposing the simultaneous constraints of 1) maintaining the reference gray point x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub>, 2) mapping a first image histogram fixed percentile value (x<sub>ho </sub>set to the 99.0% cumulative histogram function value) to the white point value x<sub>w</sub>, 3) mapping a second image histogram fixed percentile value (x<sub>he </sub>set to the 99.9% cumulative histogram function value) to the extreme white point value x<sub>we</sub>, and using two or more functions to construct the tone scale segment. Similarly, the inflection point exhibited within the shadow tone scale segment is a consequence of imposing the simultaneous constraints of 1) maintaining the reference gray point x<sub>&#x3c1;</sub>, 2) mapping a first image histogram fixed percentile value (x<sub>so </sub>set to the 1.0% cumulative histogram function value) to the black point value x<sub>b</sub>, 3) mapping a second image histogram fixed percentile value (x<sub>se </sub>set to the 0.1% cumulative histogram function value) to the extreme black point value x<sub>be</sub>, and using two or more functions to construct the tone scale segment.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0132">Therefore, satisfying the simultaneous constraints of mapping two or more image histogram fixed percentile values to two different white point values can produce an inflection point within the highlight domain of the tone scale function. The inflection point feature of the tone scale function is sometimes necessary to achieve the bright white visual appearance of recorded specular highlights (mapped to the extreme white point value) while simultaneously achieving the darker than bright white appearance of other recorded bright scene content. For example, in a given scene, a yellow flower can represent a bright object that is mapped to the white point x<sub>w </sub>thus achieving a bright yellow appearance. By mapping the average pixel value corresponding to the yellow flower scene content to a value that is less than the brightest value achievable by the photographic paper, the spatial modulation within the yellow flower image region can be numerically expressed, and therefore, visually appreciated. In the same scene, the brightest portions of white cloud scene content, or the glint reflection off a shinny surface, are mapped to the extreme white point x<sub>we </sub>thus achieving the bright white visual appearance. If instead only one of these two white point mapping constraints were satisfied, the resultant tone scale function would not achieve an inflection point and the visual appearance of either the specular highlights or the yellow flower detail would be sacrificed. Thus it will be appreciated that the inflection point feature within the highlight tone scale segment can be important for impressive visual results when viewing the processed digital images.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0133">A similar argument can be made for the shadow tone scale segment. Satisfying the simultaneous constraints of mapping two or more image histogram fixed percentile values to two different black point values can produce an inflection point within the shadow domain of the tone scale function. The extreme shadows of images, such as the deep shadows of a forest scene or the dark background of a night flash scene, are optimally mapped to the extreme black point x<sub>be </sub>corresponding to the highest achievable paper density. This mapping strategy produces visually pleasing results since the darkest image regions appear black on the photographic print. However, other shadow scene content that may relate to the main subject, such as a back lighted face or dark clothing, may need to be mapped to a pixel value that is numerically higher than the extreme black point to enable the visualization of image spatial detail. Therefore, for optimal shadow scene content rendering, an inflection point (resulting from the two point mapping constraints) within the shadow tone scale segment is an important feature of the tone scale function.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0134">It should also be noted that the inflection point feature of the tone scale function achieved at the reference gray point is similarly a consequence of simultaneously applying the black and white point mapping constraints. Thus it will also be appreciated that the tone scale functions produced with the present invention achieve an inflection point at the reference gray point as well as within the highlight and shadow tone scale segments.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0135">Another important feature of the tone scale functions produced with the present invention is the independence of the inflection points achieved in the highlight and shadow tone scale segments. Depending on the image histogram data, one or both of the these tone scale segments may not achieve an inflection point. For example, if the shape of the image histogram is such that the 99.9% cumulative value is much larger than the 99.0% cumulative value, the slope of the highlight tone scale segment may not reverse sign and thus no inflection point will be exhibited. Similarly, if the shape of the image histogram is such that the 0.1% cumulative value is much less than the 1.0% cumulative value, the slope of the shadow tone scale segment may not reverse sign and thus no inflection point will be exhibited. However, the numerical values for the 0.1% and 1.0% cumulative values are independent of the values for the 99.0% and 99.9% cumulative values for an arbitrary digital image. Thus, tone scale functions produced with the present invention can exhibit an inflection point for the shadow tone scale segment but may not exhibit an inflection point for the highlight tone scale segment. Similarly, the tone scale function can have an inflection point for the highlight tone scale segment but not for the shadow tone scale segment. Therefore, the present invention facilitates using tone scale functions to improve the rendition of highlight and shadow regions wherein the shape of the tone scale function achieves an inflection point independently for highlight and shadow image regions and such inflection points are independently controllable of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0136">Those skilled in the art will recognize that histogram equalization methods can also produce inflection points within the domain of a tone scale function. However, the tone scale functions generated with histogram equalization methods constitute a single mathematical formulation since the statistics of the image pixel values dictate the shape of the tone scale function. This property is true even for constrained histogram equalization methods such as disclosed by Alkofer in U.S. Pat. No. 4,731,671 and by Kwon in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,465. The present invention uses a small number of fixed percentile cumulative histogram values and component functions to control the shape of the tone scale function. In one embodiment, four fixed percentile cumulative histogram values are used. Therefore, it is possible that two different digital images can have the same four fixed cumulative histogram values but have very different overall cumulative histogram function shapes. However, the tone scale function generated with the present invention for these two digital images will be the same whereas a histogram equalization method will result in very differently shaped tone scale functions for these two different digital images.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an optical fiber. Particularly, the present invention relates to an optical fiber in which an effective cross sectional area A<sub>eff </sub>is enlarged so as to use for a long-haul wavelength multiple transmission system, and dispersion slope is restrained.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Transmission capacity for an optical fiber has increased drastically by the use of a Wavelength Division Multiplexing (hereinafter called WDM) method. In the WDM method, it is required that non-linear effect should be reduced and the chromatic dispersion should be controlled in an optical fiber, which is used for data transmission. For these purpose, the development for various optical fiber such as an optical fiber of which effective cross section a<b>1</b> area A<sub>eff </sub>is enlarged, an optical fiber of which dispersion slope is reduced, and an optical fiber for compensating the dispersion slope, have been made.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to increase the transmission capacity of an optical fiber by the WDM method, there are, in general, two ways of approach. One is a method by which the number of the wavelengths to be multiplexed is increased. Another approach is that the transmission speed is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For a method for increasing the number of the wavelengths to be multiplexed, an approach is proposed by which the wavelength bandwidth to be used for data transmission is enlarged. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, chromatic dispersion characteristics of a common WDM optical fiber (a) is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For an WDM optical fiber, 1550 nm wavelength bandwidth is commonly used. In particular, a wavelength bandwidth which is called Conventional Band (1530 to 1565 nm, hereinafter called C-Band) has been used commonly. However, recently, there are proposed approaches in which wavelengths such as Long wavelength Band (hereinafter called L-Band) in 1565 to 1625 nm and Short wavelength Band (hereinafter called S-Band) in 1460 to 1530 nm should be used for data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, an optical fiber shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is proposed in which the chromatic dispersion is enlarged so as to be used in S-Band, C-Band, and L-Band.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In such optical fibers, there are various kinds of refractive index difference. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 12</figref>, examples for such optical fibers are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Among these optical fibers, an optical fiber having single-peak refractive index profile shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is used for a single mode fiber in an ordinary 1.3 &#x3bc;m bandwidth. Also, an optical fiber shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> having stepped refractive index profile in which refractive indexes in two layers are different, and an optical fiber shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> having a segment refractive index profile in which a high refractive index section is in the center part and a plurality of layers having different refractive indexes are disposed are commonly used for a zero dispersion shift fiber in the 1.55 &#x3bc;m bandwidth and a non-zero dispersion shift fiber (hereinafter called NZ-DSF) which has been developed for WDM data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For an optical fiber which is used for WDM data transfer, following characteristics are required.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">First, it is necessary to restrict a non-linear effect. Such a purpose can be realized by enlarging an effective cross sectional area A<sub>eff</sub>. Second, it is necessary to restrict an occurrence of four-photon-mixture. Such a purpose can be realized by obtaining a local dispersion. Third, it is necessary to restrict a linear distortion caused by chromatic dispersion. Such a purpose can be realized by reducing an average chromatic dispersion over an optical path. Lastly, in order to control dispersion in wide range bandwidth, it can be realized by reducing the dispersion slope.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above NZ-DSF was designed so as to be satisfied the required characteristics. However, it is very difficult to enlarge the A<sub>eff </sub>and reduce the dispersion slope simultaneously. From a commercial point of view, an optical fiber (A<sub>eff </sub>enlarged NZ-DSF) in which A<sub>eff </sub>is enlarged to 70 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>and the dispersion slope is 0.09 ps/nm<sup>2</sup>/km, and an optical fiber (low dispersion slope optical fiber) in which A<sub>eff </sub>is 50 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>and the dispersion slope is reduced to 0.05 ps/nm<sup>2</sup>/km, are commonly used for NZ-DSFs.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For an optical fiber which can realize more enlarged effective refractive index A<sub>eff </sub>and more reduced dispersion slope, an optical fiber shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> having a ring-shape refractive index profile in which a central part of the core has low refractive index and high refractive index section therearound are disposed is known. For an optical fiber having such a ring-shaped refractive index profile, an optical fiber in which A<sub>eff </sub>enlarged to 100 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>and the dispersion slope is restricted at 0.06 to 0.08 ps/nm<sup>2</sup>/km is reported in &#x201c;ECOC '96 MoB. 3. 2&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, there has not been a report that an optical fiber having the ring-shape refractive index profile can realize lower loss. For example, in the above report, 0.23 dB/km of loss has been reported. No other report mentions such lower loss characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the transmission loss so as to realize an optical fiber having a ring-shaped profile.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an optical fiber having conventional ring-shaped refractive index profile, an absolute value for a chromatic dispersion in 1550 nm wavelength is set to zero or lower than 6 ps/nm/km. Chromatic dispersion such as 6 ps/nm/km is in accordance with a specification of a conventional NZ-DSF. The refractive index profile of an optical fiber having such a chromatic dispersion area is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Characteristics of this optical fiber is shown in TABLE 1.</p>

A vertical axis indicates a refractive index difference between each core and the clad. Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a product of a square of electric field E in a dominant mode which transmits in an optical fiber and the distance r in the radial direction is shown by dotted line.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The transmission loss of this optical fiber in the 1550 nm wavelength is 0.231 dB/km. This transmission loss is as high as that of the optical fiber having conventional ring-shaped refractive index profile. Also, value &#x201c;a&#x201d; which indicates an inclination to 1/&#x3bb;<sup>4 </sup>is 1.183. Such a value is very large in contrast that a value &#x201c;a&#x201d; in an ordinary NZ-DSF is nearly 1.06. Such a high transmission loss in the optical fiber is caused by Rayleigh loss. In order to realize an optical fiber having low loss, it is necessary to reduce the Rayleigh loss.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The present invention is explained in detail as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An optical fiber according to the present invention has a core containing two or more layers of which refractive indexes are different such that one of the layer except a center part of the core has the largest refractive index (hereinafter called ring-shaped refractive index profile), wherein chromatic dispersion is between +6 ps/nm/km or larger and smaller than +15 ps/nm/km in 1550 nm wavelength, and transmission loss is smaller than 0.210 dB/km.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In such an optical fiber having a ring-shaped refractive index profile, it is necessary to reduce the Rayleigh loss. For that purpose, the refractive index profile can be more even than that of a conventional optical fiber by setting the chromatic dispersion in 1550 nm wavelength to be in a range of +6 to +15 ps/nm/km which is larger than the chromatic dispersion in a conventional NZ-DSF. That is, it is possible to reduce dopants in an optical fiber; thus, Rayleigh loss can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a refractive index profile in an optical fiber under condition that the optical fiber has chromatic dispersion which is almost the same refractive index profile shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is designed to have more enlarged chromatic dispersion larger than +9 ps/nm/km. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a horizontal axis indicates a distance from a center of the core in a radial direction. A vertical axis indicates a refractive index difference for each core to the clad. Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a product of a square of electric field E in a dominant mode which transmits in an optical fiber and the distance r in the radial direction is shown by dotted line.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An example for refractive index profile in an optical fiber according to the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference numeral <b>1</b> indicates a first layer core section which is a center of the core. Reference numeral <b>2</b> indicates a second layer core section which is formed around the first layer core section <b>1</b> so as to have higher refractive index than that of the first layer core section <b>1</b>. Reference numeral <b>3</b> indicates a third layer core section which is formed around the second layer core section <b>2</b> so as to have lower refractive index than that of the second layer core section <b>2</b>. Reference numeral <b>4</b> indicates a fourth layer core section which is formed around the third layer core section <b>3</b> so as to have higher refractive index than that of the third layer core section <b>3</b>. Reference numeral <b>5</b> indicates a clad which is formed around the fourth layer core section <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this example, the refractive index in the first layer core section <b>1</b> and the refractive index in the third layer core section <b>3</b> are lower than that in the clad <b>5</b>. Also, the refractive index in the second layer core section <b>2</b> is the highest. Here, the refractive index difference in the first layer core section <b>1</b> is &#x394;<b>1</b> under condition that the refractive index in the clad <b>5</b> is a reference point. Also, the refractive index difference in the second layer core section <b>2</b> is &#x394;<b>2</b>. The refractive index difference in the third layer core section <b>3</b> is &#x394;<b>3</b>. The refractive index in the fourth layer core section <b>4</b> is &#x394;<b>4</b>. Under such condition, absolute value for the refractive index difference &#x394;<b>1</b> in the first layer core section <b>1</b> and the refractive index difference &#x394;<b>3</b> in the third layer core section <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are smaller than that in the conventional optical fiber shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">An object of the present invention is to realize an optical fiber having low loss characteristics. The loss in the optical fiber greatly depends on the Rayleigh scattering in the optical fiber. Actually, the Rayleigh scattering caused in the optical fiber has a relationship with amount of dopant in an area where the Rayleigh scattering occurs and the electric field. For an index for indicating an influence caused by the Rayleigh scattering, a Multiple of Refractive Index and Power (hereinafter called MRIP) which is defined by a formula F1 is useful.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In formula F1, r indicates a distance from a center of the core in a radial direction. &#x394;r is a refractive index difference for a clad. E(r) indicates distribution for electric field of the dominant mode in the light which is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a conventional NZ-DSF shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, MRIP is designed nearly at 0.5. In contrast, in an optical fiber shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, MRIP is 0.42. Thus, the MRIP is reduced by nearly 10%. As explained in embodiments of the present invention later, it is possible to reduce the transmission loss in a preferable level such as 0.210 dB/km or lower by reducing the Rayleigh loss.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an optical fiber in this example, it is preferable the chromatic dispersion is higher than +6 ps/nm/km. If the chromatic dispersion is lower than +6 ps/nm/km, it is anticipated that the loss cannot be reduced sufficiently. Thus, by setting the chromatic dispersion at +6 ps/nm/km or higher, the chromatic dispersion does not become zero in the S-Band; therefore, such optical fiber can be used for WDM data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Also, it is preferable the chromatic dispersion is lower than +15 ps/nm/km. If the chromatic dispersion is higher than +15 ps/nm/km, it is possible to realize the same characteristics even if a refractive index dispersion such as a single-peak refractive index profile and a stepped refractive index profile is used instead of the ring-shaped refractive index profile according to the present invention. That is, there is not merit in using an optical fiber having the ring-shaped refractive index profile.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to the optical fiber having a core containing two or more layers of which refractive indexes are different such that one of the layer except a center part of the core has the largest refractive index wherein chromatic dispersion is between +6 ps/nm/km or larger and smaller than +15 ps/nm/km in 1550 nm wavelength, it is possible to realize an optical fiber having a ring-shaped refractive index profile with low loss characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Also, because it is possible to make effective cross sectional area in the 1550 nm wavelength larger than 90 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, it is possible to realize an optical fiber which can restrict the non-linear effect.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Also, because it is possible to make the dispersion slope in the 1550 nm wavelength smaller than 0.08 ps/nm<sup>2</sup>/km, it is possible to realize an optical fiber which can control the dispersion in wide range of the wavelength bandwidth; thus it is possible to realize high-speed high-quality optical fiber for data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Also, by setting the MRIP at 0.45 or lower, it is possible to restrict the transmission loss lower than 0.210 dB/km. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the loss caused by the Rayleigh scattering; thus, it is possible to realize an optical fiber having low loss characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Hereinafter, embodiments of an optical fiber according to the present invention are shown with reference to drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Here, A<sub>eff </sub>is approximately 100 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>. Dispersion slope is 0.069 ps/nm<sup>2</sup>/km. Thus, it can be confirmed that A<sub>eff </sub>is enlarged and the dispersion slope is reduced. In addition, the transmission loss in the 1550 nm wavelength is 0.206 dB/km; thus, 0.02 dB/km or more transmission loss is reduced comparing to the conventional optical fiber having ring-shaped refractive index profile.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The loss wavelength characteristics for the wavelength &#x3bb; in this optical fiber is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, value &#x201c;a&#x201d; is 1.06. Therefore, it is understood that the characteristics has been improved; thus, nearly the same level as that of the conventional NZ-DSF of improvement has been achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the chromatic dispersion characteristics in this optical fiber is shown. The chromatic dispersion in the 1550 nm wavelength is +8 ps/nm/km which is larger than that of the conventional NZ-DSF. Also, the dispersion slope is restricted at 0.065 ps/nm/km which can be understood to be fairly lower level. In this example, the chromatic dispersion is +1 ps/nm/km or more in the S-Band; therefore, not only the C-Band and the L-Band, but also the S-Band can be used for data transmission.</p>
