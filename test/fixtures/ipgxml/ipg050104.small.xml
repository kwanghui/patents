<heading id="heading-d0e1627" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention relates to the field of protective coverings and more particularly to devices for holding an absorbent paper or cloth napkin or similar protective item over one's clothing and more particularly still over the chest and torso to protect one's clothing or apparel while dining. More particularly still the invention relates to a magnetic holding device into which such absorbent napkin is easily inserted or, in other words, which is easily connected to an absorbent or protective napkin and, from which holding device the napkin is readily removable upon the application of a relatively small amount of force applied generally as a downward pulling force on the napkin.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Preliminary Discussion</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Normally, it is desirable to protect one's clothing from the well known hazard of accidental food spillage during eating, particularly if the diner is wearing business or other formal or semi-formal attire, or merely even clothes which the diner is particularly anxious not to stain, or if dining out at a restaurant, formal banquet, or other function where one wishes to be particularly careful not to stain one's clothes. While certain foods such as pasta, soups, desserts, beverages, or really any food that includes a sauce or gravy, are more likely to leave stains if they drip or splash onto one's clothing, virtually any salubrious or less than salubrious, edible or gastronomical delight can accidentally fall from a fork, knife, spoon, glass, cup or hand while in transit towards the mouth. Spilling of food or drink on a coat, tie, blouse, jacket, and the like is not only untidy, but is also embarrassing not only at the time, but also until such time as the wearer has the opportunity to change the soiled clothing, which may often not be for several hours or more. In fact, spilled food stains are more embarrassing after the fact than at the time of the spillage because of the untidy and careless appearance that stains on one's clothing tend to present. Spilling food is usually forgivable, if only done occasionally. However, wearing food-stained clothing is often not acceptable in general society at any time, even for food service workers.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Bibs for protecting one's clothing are well known, but are normally only used by parents for toddlers or by other relatively young persons and occasionally by the very elderly. Adults usually will simply tuck a cloth or paper napkin into the neck or collar of their shirt or blouse, or else forego any protection at all over the front of their body and simply place a napkin over or upon their lap area. This may be particularly so where the person in question does not wish to appear less than skillful in his or her eating habits, eating being very largely a social skill as well as a biological necessity. Sometimes, when eating particularly messy items, a napkin or absorbent material may be clipped either directly to the apparel of the user or else simply tied around the neck or tucked into the clothing of the user. The clips used frequently have small teeth on their surface or extending from the side of the clip to obtain a better grip on the napkin. One drawback of the use of a clip is that in order for the user to remove the napkin from the clip, either so that the napkin may be used to wipe one's mouth or simply if the user has finished dining and wishes to remove the napkin permanently, the clip must be grasped by the user with one hand so that the jaws or the like of the clip can be opened. At the same time, the napkin must be pulled or removed from the clip by moving or pulling on it with the other hand. If the napkin has instead been tied with a cord or the like around the neck of the user, it must now be untied. All this tends to attract the attention of others and frequently embarrasses the one removing their napkin if not skillfully done. Such procedures also can be difficult for some users, particularly if one's hands are still in a somewhat soiled condition, or if the user is elderly or has some affliction such as arthritis or the like which makes it difficult to perform these tasks quickly or easily. There remains, therefore, a need for a device which can be used to quickly secure or release a napkin or absorbent protective material from a position over the front of one's body during dining. Any such device should be both attractive and unobtrusive to others, and should be capable of being manufactured inexpensively. The present inventor has conceived of and developed a holding device fulfilling these requirements wherein the napkin is secured between pairs of magnetically activated attractive panels or securing pads secured in turn to the ends of a preferably decorative neck lanyard. The magnetically attractive panels or pads are arranged so that a relatively slight sidewise or more usually downward tension on the napkin will cause it to be released from the holding device, or from between the panels or securing pads, so such napkin may be otherwise used, discarded or retained for further use. Such quick release feature may be particularly useful where one may wish to quickly use the napkin to wipe or protect other portions of the body such as the face, lap or the like, or to use the napkin mopping a spilled beverage or the like.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">The invention comprises not only a novel securing device for use with napkins and the like, but also a combination of the napkin securing device of the invention together with a napkin or napkins to be used with such securing device in the form of a kit, system or combination for efficient clothing or personal protection. The napkins as well as the clip can be monogrammed or provided with identifying symbols, logos or the like of providers, sponsors or other organizations to serve as advertising or promotion items for such sponsors. The securing device itself can be composed of any lightly yet securely clamping magnetic clip having two fairly smooth clamping faces arranged in pairs on the two ends of a neck lanyard allowing a napkin or the like to be securely held between such clamping faces, but to be released from secured relationship with merely a single sidewise or more usually a downward tug without tearing or otherwise damaging the napkin, particularly when it is desired to remove such napkin from over the chest area or the front of the user. More particularly, the preferred magnetic clips are formed of or from pairs of plastic pads or tabs which may have an oval configuration with the large portion of the oval worn downwardly and containing in one pad or tab a powerful magnet embedded or encapsulated in the plastic and in the opposing pad a magnetically energizable metal piece embedded or encapsulated in the plastic, which metal piece will tend to be attracted strongly to the magnet. The magnet and magnetically energizable metal, or pole piece, are conveniently embedded or encapsulated in the plastic pads during a molding operation by which the pads are formed or alternatively, and in most, but not all cases, less conveniently by forming such pads in two halves with hollowed out spaces on their interior faces into which the magnet and magnetically energizable metal or pole piece are placed and the two sections of plastic closed over the magnet or pole piece and adhered to one another. The metal pole piece in one pad could alternatively be replaced by another magnet arranged so the polarity of the magnets are opposite to each other. Smaller or less powerful magnets could then be used. However, it has been found that a magnet and opposite metal attractant, or pole piece, are efficient and easier to use. The term &#x201c;pole piece&#x201d; is used herein to refer not necessarily to a metal piece that bridges the poles of a magnet and tends to preserve the magnetism, but to a metal piece that may be attracted to or toward a magnet and through which lines of magnetic force may pass drawing the magnetically attractable metal toward the nearest pole of the magnet. Another magnet may constitute a pole piece and indeed the magnetizable metal while drawn to the permanent magnet becomes itself a temporary magnet. The plastic pads or panels in which the magnet and pole piece are embedded or encapsulated must, as noted above, have relatively smooth surfaces to allow relatively free sliding of the napkin between the faces until released from the pads upon the application of an amount of sidewise or downward force insufficient to tear the material of the napkin. The outer face or faces of one or both pairs of panels or pads may have any desired decoration applied thereto preferably in the form of a raised or embossed emblem or the like or a recess for the receipt or insertion of a desired decorative or identifying emblem or label and the lanyard connecting the pairs of magnetic clamping pads may be decorated in any manner in keeping with the napkins with which they may be supplied as a set or later used. Because the pads or tabs preferably physically contain the magnet and magnetisable pole piece they are conveniently referred to hereafter in some cases as front and back, or frontal and interior housings or magnet housings. Because a powerful magnet tends to be thicker than a pole piece used with such magnet and because it is frequently convenient to have the magnet on the outside when worn, the frontal housing will in most cases be somewhat thicker than the interior housing.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">3. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">The following prior art patents related to magnetic holding devices or other similar products incorporating or demonstrating concepts which may bear upon the present invention are known by the present inventor. None of such devices, however, includes a device for holding a clothing protective material over the front of one's torso while dining as conceived by the present inventor.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,557,398 and 2,557,399 both issued to M. O. Teetor on Jun. 19, 1951, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Holder for Display Cards,&#x201d; each disclose a magnetic display card holder wherein display cards are held between a pair of magnetic holding units. In the '398 patent, a magnetic attraction is generated between the holding units and a metal plate, rather than between the two holding units, so that the display card is situated between the two holding units, but is not actually held by a magnetic attraction between the holding units. In the '399 patent, the metal plate is omitted, and the magnets are angled so that there is a magnetic attraction between the holding units, and so that the display card is actually held between the holding units by such magnetic attraction. As with most of the magnetic holders in the prior art, however, they are designed to hold the display card as tightly as possible, rather than in a manner wherein the card can be easily slipped out of such units, which slippage is a key feature of the holding units in the present inventor's napkin or bib holder. U.S. Design Patent 378.531 issued to B. Szikszay on Mar. 18, 1997, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Document Holder,&#x201d; also discloses an ornamental design for a clip-like magnetic paper or document holder having flanges between which a document may be secured.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">U.S. Pat. No. 4,255,837 issued to H. Holtz on Mar. 17, 1981, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Clip Device,&#x201d; discloses another clip for magnetically containing sheet-like materials such as memos, cards, and the like. Holt is unique in that the clip is made from two thin magnetic plates or foils having alternating polarity along their faces, which apparently aids in correctly aligning the magnetically attractive plates. See also U.S. Pat. No. 4,258,493 issued to John S. Kettlestrings et al. on Mar. 31, 1981, entitled &#x201c;Advertising Display Means and Method,&#x201d; which discloses a magnetic holder for holding signs and the like in a vertical orientation, wherein when the magnets are brought into face-to-face alignment, the alternating poles of such magnets line up to create an attractive force. Such holders do not include a smooth or slippery surface over the magnets so that items can be easily slipped out of the holders, however.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">U.S. Pat. No. 3,529,328 issued to P. T. Davison on Sep. 22, 1970, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Clothespin,&#x201d; discloses a clothespin comprised of an elongated strap having enlarged generally round ends in which a ferrous plug and a magnet are disposed, respectively. When the ends of the strap are brought together, there is a magnetic attraction between the magnet and plug that is strong enough to retain a garment such as a pair of stockings hanging from a clothesline. The clothespin has vinyl outer side cover heat sealed to a vinyl inner side liner, which inner liner has a grain thereon to increase the friction between the device and the item being supported so that it does not detach when acted upon by mild forces such as wind force or the like. Therefore, while Davison teaches a clothespin that is similar to the present invention in that the garment is held by magnetic attraction, Davison does not teach a napkin or bib holder comprised of a lanyard having magnetic holding devices on its ends which lanyard is draped around the neck of the user and wherein the napkin or bib is releasably held by the securing devices over the front of the user's torso. In addition, the present inventor does not score or emboss the inner surface of the holder with a fine grain to increase the friction between the device and the item supported, but in fact intentionally provides a smooth or at least mildly slippery surface between the magnets or between the magnetic casings so that the napkin can be slipped out of the device easily simply by a light tug on the napkin itself.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">U.S. Pat. No. 3,577,583 issued to W. R. Amann on May 4, 1971, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Clamp,&#x201d; discloses a magnetic clamp for holding sheet material suspended and movable along an overhead track. The clamp has opposed body portions, one of which may be flexed inwardly around its central portion, causing the end of such member to pivot outwardly, opening the magnetic clamp so that sheet material can be easily inserted or removed. Amann therefore teaches a unique means for opening and closing a magnetic clamp; however, the clamp is not designed so that the sheet material can be easily slipped out of the clamp as in the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">U.S. Pat. No. 3,629,905 issued to D. J. Cote on Dec. 28, 1971, entitled &#x201c;Bread Bag Resealer,&#x201d; discloses an elongated magnetic clip comprised of a pair of opposed members which are fitted over the mouth of a bag to hold such opening closed. A spring steel clip helps urge the members into a closed position. To open the clip, the members are manually pulled apart or slid sidewardly respective to each other. The Cote clip apparently is not designed so that the bag can be easily slipped from between the opposed members upon the application of a relatively small amount of force on the bag, which is a key feature of the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">Various other items utilizing a magnetic clasp are also known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,741,376 issued to R. G. Brown, et al. on Jun. 26, 1973, entitled &#x201c;Pocket Holder with Magnetic Clasp,&#x201d; discloses an eyeglass case having a magnetic clasp on one side which is used to secure the holder in a garment pocket with the clasp extending over the outside of the pocket. Magnetic locks are also prevalent, such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,021,891 issued to T. Morita on May 10, 1977, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Lock Closure,&#x201d; wherein a magnetic lock having a rod portion is secured in an aperture holding a magnetically attractive element. U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,238 issued to J. D. Eldridge, Jr. on May 8, 1984, entitled &#x201c;Medical Tubing Holder,&#x201d; discloses a holder for vacuum tubes, electrical cords or the like comprised of a foam backing element having two sections which are held together by a magnetic attraction when the backing is folded. A plastic strip is secured to the backside of the backing element which is wrapped around a tube and then held between the folded magnets. The strip is manufactured with a surface designed to make it extremely difficult to pull the strip out from between the magnets.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,373 issued to J. T. Taylor on Feb. 16, 1993, entitled &#x201c;Connector Assembly for Removably Holding a Glove,&#x201d; discloses a holder having a magnet secured to each of two folded portions for clipping to a garment pocket, while a pair of gloves or like is secured to a Velcro&#xae; patch on the outer face of the clip. The magnet in Taylor is therefore used to secure the clip to a pocket rather than to hold an item to the clip as in the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 5,450,658 issued to J. R. Hicks on Sep. 19, 1995, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Sock Holder,&#x201d; discloses a sock holder having encapsulated magnetic panels. A pair of housing members are sandwiched around a portion of the sock material, which members are then secured together during laundering via the encapsulated magnets. No material is actually secured between the magnets, however. U.S. Pat. No. 5,926,925 also issued to J. R. is Hicks on Jul. 27, 1999, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Sock Holder,&#x201d; discloses a slight variation of such holder. U.S. Pat. No. 5,895,018 issued to R. G. Rielo on Apr. 20, 1999, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Support Attachment&#x201d; discloses a similar support for holding a kitchen towel or the like with barbs wherein the magnet is primarily used not to secure the towel, but to secure the holder to another magnetic or magnetizable surface such as a refrigerator door, etc.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">Various bibs and aprons are also known to the present inventor, such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,220,692 issued to L. Cox on Jun. 22, 1993, entitled &#x201c;Driver's Apron,&#x201d; which discloses an apron primarily to be worn while driving to protect the driver from accidentally spilled or falling food. The neck strap is secured to the apron by Velcro&#xae; type fastening pads so that the apron can be put on or removed using one hand. In addition, the sides of the apron are weighted to help maintain it in place over the lap and legs of the user. While Cox discloses an easily removable apron or bib, Cox does not disclose the use of magnetically attractive holders to secure the neck strap to the protective apron as in the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 6,079,048 issued to D. F. Campbell on Jun. 27, 2000, entitled &#x201c;Self-Adhesive Napkin,&#x201d; discloses a napkin for protecting clothing while a person is eating comprised of a sheet of absorbent material, a neck receiving recess, and an adhesive material on the inside surface along the upper edge of the napkin for temporarily securing the napkin to the clothes of a user. Such napkin is temporarily adhered directly to one's clothing, which may be undesirable with respect to some users.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">U.S. Pat. No. 5,425,160 issued to W. A. Krapf on Jun. 20, 1995, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Paper Clamp and Method of Producing Same,&#x201d; discloses a magnetic clamp for releasably securing sheets of paper and the like comprised of a U-shaped plastic strip with two magnetic strips secured on the inner face of such strip. A radiused fold in the strip acts as a tension hinge so that the magnetic strips can be easily separated for insertion or removal of the sheets of paper therebetween but also so that the tension hinge urges the sections of the strip into a closed position. A method of making such clamp is also disclosed.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">U.S. Pat. No. 5,682,653 issued to F. Berglof et al. on Nov. 4, 1997, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Fastening Device,&#x201d; discloses a simple magnetic fastener comprised of two pairs of magnetically attractive members interconnected by a U-shaped tubular sheath made from a heat shrinkable plastic. Such fastening device apparently can be used to hold various items such as a nametag or the like, Berglof does not, however, indicate that the magnets are covered with a generally or effectively slippery surface so that materials held by the fastener can be easily removed by tugging on such materials without having to manually open the clamp.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">U.S. Pat. No. 6,101,688 issued to A. Marchesi on Aug. 15, 2000, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Closure with Casing Made of Nonferromagnetic Material, for Bags, Items of Clothing and the Like,&#x201d; discloses a magnetic closure comprising an outer container, magnetic ring, magnetic flange, and rear plate. The novel aspect of the Marchesi clip is that the casing is thinner in the portion directly over the magnets so that such casing will not interfere with the magnetic adhesion force between the encased magnets. Marchesi does not indicate, however, that the casing should be made of a slippery substance to facilitate easy removal of an item from the closure device.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">U.S. Pat. No. 6,226,842 issued to S. C. Wong on May 8, 2001, entitled &#x201c;Waterproof, Washable Plastic Magnetic Button and a Method for Manufacturing It,&#x201d; discloses a button body having a decorative top face and through holes along its edge portion. A magnet is housed in a cavity in the button, with a steel plate used to cover the back and sides of the magnet. Wong uses a stronger-than-conventional magnet, and in addition, claims that the steel plate concentrates the magnetic force on the face of the button while decreasing the magnetic force on the back face. A method of manufacturing is also provided. U.S. Design Pat. No. 448,703 issued to Y. S. Lam on Oct. 2, 2001; entitled &#x201c;Convex Magnetic Button,&#x201d; discloses another design for a magnetic button.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">U.S. Pat. No. 6,282,760 issued to M. K. Mars on Sep. 4, 2001, entitled &#x201c;Magnetic Attachment Device,&#x201d; discloses a magnetic attachment device primarily for temporarily attaching items such as name tags and the like to garments having inner and outer magnets with the outer magnet attached to an anchor, and with the pin attached to the anchor via a central passageway. The pin, while detachably secured to a garment, is not designed to be easily removed from the clothing article as in the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">Despite the variety of inventions discussed above, many of which have rather different objectives that than those of the present invention, there remains a need for an improved arrangement for protecting one's apparel from becoming soiled as a result of untidy and embarrassing spills occurring while dining. More particularly, there is a need for a device for securing a cloth or paper napkin, bib, or other absorbent material over the front of one's chest and torso during eating to prevent accidental soiling of an apparel item by spilling or dropping what is being eaten. Such device should make it easy to attach the napkin to the holder, and in addition the napkin should be easily removable from the holder simply as a result of the application of a relatively small kin, wherein it will then be released from the holder without in such as ripping or catching on the holder. The present this need.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1742" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">It is therefore a primary object of the invention to provide a device for temporarily holding a napkin, bib, towel, apron or other piece of absorbent material over the torso of a user.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a holding device comprised of a lanyard having a pair of gripping members secured on either end, each of such gripping members being comprised of a magnetically attractive section detachably securable to the upper edge or side of the napkin.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a holder for an absorbent napkin wherein the absorbent material is held by magnetic attraction between two sections of the holder.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1807" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">The present invention is essentially a device for magnetically and releasably securing a napkin, bib, apron, or other absorbent protective material over the front of one's chest or upper torso while dining. The device is comprised of a pair of magnetically attractive gripping members secured to opposite ends of a connecting lanyard long enough to fit across the back of one's neck. Each gripping member is comprised of a pair of opposed similarly sized and shaped preferably plastic tabs or housings, each encapsulating a small but powerful magnet or other magnetically attractive element so that when brought together the gripping members are strong enough to hold or support a napkin or similar item therebetween. The inner surface of the tabs or housings is intentionally made smooth or even somewhat slippery to minimize frictional forces between the tabs and the absorbent material. In use, the ends of the napkin are placed between the tabs with the lanyard around the neck of the user, so that the napkin generally covers the chest and torso of the user and will absorb any food or beverage items which might be accidentally spilled upon the upper torso of the user. While the napkin is held securely between the tabs or housings by the magnetic attraction between such tabs under normal conditions, the semi-slippery surface allows the napkin to be easily removed from the holder simply by applying a small degree of force on the napkin. A logo or design is preferably placed on the outer surface of the tabs or housings, so that the device also serves as an attractive advertising, promotion or marketing tool. Kits containing one or more napkins plus one or more of the magnetic holders may be supplied.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e2095" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="P-00060" num="00060">The following detailed description is of the best mode or modes of the invention presently contemplated. Such description is not intended to be understood in a limiting sense, but to be an example of the invention presented solely for illustration thereof, and by reference to which in connection with the following description and the accompanying drawings one skilled in the art may be advised of the advantages and construction of the invention.</p>
<p id="P-00061" num="00061">The present invention is directed to a device for holding a cloth or paper napkin, bib, apron, or the like in place over one's clothing or apparel while eating. The device is comprised of two gripping members connected by a lanyard or a fitting attached to a lanyard said lanyard being long enough to traverse the back of the neck of the wearer. A breakaway safety mechanism may be provided on the lanyard to prevent accidental injury in case of some sort of snagging of the lanyard during use, although the smooth faces of the securing means provides an automatic snag prevention between the lanyard and the napkin as well. Each gripping member is comprised of a pair of preferably similarly sized and shaped tabs or housing members in face-to-face alignment which housings are pivotable on the end of the lanyard or an intermittent fitting laterally relative to each other as well as movable directly away from each other with the application of additional force. Encapsulated in each housing member is either a permanent magnet or a magnetically attractive member so that a magnetic attraction between such magnet and magnetically attractive member strong enough to place pressure upon and retain the cloth or other item between the housings is provided. The magnetically attractive members may either be other magnets themselves or more preferably magnetisable metal pieces, which can be referred to as pole pieces, through which magnetic lines of force will be concentrated or directed so such magnetisable pieces, or pole pieces, are attracted to and held against the magnet in the opposite housing. The inner surface of each of the opposed tabs or housing members is intentionally made smooth so as to minimize the frictional forces between the napkin and the gripping members during use. Preferably the surfaces are therefore semi-slippery, but not truly slippery, since the holders must obtain sufficient purchase or hold upon the napkins to support their weight against downward slippage under normal circumstances. The usual napkin will be formed of a fibrous (so it is absorbent) cellulose band material whether the fibers are fabric or paper fibers. The outer surfaces of the housing members may be adapted to receive virtually any desired marking or decoration, including logos, insignias, monograms, advertising pieces and the like, so that the device may also serve as an effective marketing, promotion or advertising tool. In use, the lanyard is placed around the back of the neck of the user, the housing members are slid apart or otherwise separated, and the top edge of the napkin is inserted between each pair of housing members, after which the housing members are brought back into side-by-side alignment. The napkin will then be supported by the device so that it hangs over the front portion of the user's torso and protects the user's shirt, blouse, coat, or other garment. Under normal usage, the napkin will remain in such position until it is desired or desirable for it to be removed. Removal of the napkin from the device is accomplished simply by applying a small amount of generally downward force on the napkin so that it slides or slips out from between the housing members without any further manipulation of such members being required. The magnetic attraction between the magnetic elements, the thickness of the plastic casing over the magnetic elements, the size of the surface of each element contacting the surface of a napkin and the surface characteristics, i.e. the smoothness or slipperiness of the plastic surface, should be such that an ordinary cloth or paper napkin wilt be securely held by the magnetic holders in ordinary use, but the napkin will slide out of such holders upon application of one quarter to three-quarters of a pound plus or minus an ounce or two of fairly suddenly applied force such as a light hand tug applying this much force. In the case of a longer heavier napkin, the magnetic force may be made greater to accommodate the heavier napkin while still releasing with an additional force of one quarter to three quarters of a pound plus or minus an ounce or two serving to release the napkin may be desirable. Since the napkin itself will on average vary from an eighth of a pound up to half a pound or more, the force which should be resisted with respect to slippage of the napkin may be from one quarter pound at a minimum to as much as a pound or slightly more. This resolves itself into a desired resistance of a napkin normal, or at right angles to the magnetic force between holders, of between about four ounces at a minimum up to, as a practical matter, 20 ounces or one and one quarter pounds. It is convenient usually to refer to the extra force necessary to slip the napkin out of the holders as this refers more directly to the force which a user will apply to the napkin to remove it from the holders. This can be referred to as the &#x201c;release&#x201d; force. As will be understood, if the force necessary to detach the napkin from the holder is too great or too little, the intended usefulness of the invention will be severely limited. As a practical matter, where matched sets or packages of napkins and magnetic holders are supplied the strength of the magnetic holders, or their holding power will be matched to the weight and texture of the napkins. Where the holders are supplied for use separately, however, an average for the weight and texture of napkin likely to be met with will be adopted.</p>
<p id="P-00062" num="00062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a magnetic holding device <b>10</b> in accordance with the principles of the present invention primarily for holding a cloth or paper napkin in a position covering the human chest and torso while dining, although the device may also be used to hold a towel, bib, apron, or other similar protective and absorbent material in such position. Holding device <b>10</b> is generally comprised of a pair of gripping members or magnetic holders <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> connected by a lanyard <b>16</b>. Lanyard <b>16</b> preferably includes a breakaway metal or plastic middle connector or clasp <b>18</b> of a type well known to those skilled in the art that will disconnect the lanyard into two parts or sections if the tension on the lanyard is increased beyond a predetermined breaking point or disconnect tension. Therefore, if the lanyard accidentally becomes caught or snagged on something, it will separate into two parts <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> rather than possibly causing injury to the user. Other types of detachable or breakaway connectors, such as made from Velcro or rubber, may also be used. While it is preferred to use the breakaway connector <b>18</b>, since the smooth faces of the magnetic mountings also enable the device to easily separate or detach from a napkin, there is in effect also an inherent safety breakaway system.</p>
<p id="P-00063" num="00063">Gripping members <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> positioned on opposite ends of lanyard <b>16</b> are comprised of a pair of adjacent pads, tabs or, as usually referred to herein, housing members, with housing members <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>secured on the first end <b>26</b> of lanyard <b>16</b>, and housing members <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>secured on the second end <b>28</b> of lanyard <b>16</b>. Housing members <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are secured to lanyard <b>16</b> in such a manner that they are pivotable respective to each other both laterally, i.e. are slidable sideways respective to each other and directly away from each other pivoting about the point where they are connected at one end to the lanyard. As described below, sideways sliding or lateral movement between the housing members allows such members to be slid apart for the insertion of a napkin therebetween rather than trying to separate the housing by attempting to pull against the force of the magnetic attraction, which is considerably more difficult. In the embodiment shown, apertures <b>30</b> are provided in housing members <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>through which apertures the first and second ends <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> of lanyard <b>16</b> are respectively threaded or passed and then looped back upon themselves and the ends are then heat secured or sealed onto an adjacent portion of the lanyard. The end of the lanyard could also be doubled back and secured to itself in any convenient manner such as by use of a sleeved fitting, the use of an adhesive or even by tying. The loop formed provides in effect a ring or semi-lateral ring at the end of the lanyard upon which the two tabs <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>may be laterally rotated with respect to each other. Other means for attaching housing members <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>to the lanyard in slidable or rotatable relation to each other, such as an actual intermediate ring or a clasp, may alternatively be used. The length of the lanyard is preferably about 18 inches in length, but may be from about 16 to 20 inches in length to hold a napkin in a serviceable position or height upon the front of the torso of the user above the user's lap. Extra long napkins may be supplied so that they extend down the front and then over the lap of the user.</p>
<p id="P-00064" num="00064">Each housing member <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>is preferably generally flat and has an inner side <b>32</b> and an outer side <b>34</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The housing members may be provided in a variety of sizes and shapes, such as the generally round, semielliptical or oval shape shown in the majority of the FIGS., and are preferably made from a rigid material such as a polymer or plastic. The housings could also be made in special shapes for special uses or more likely for special users. For example, they might be in the shape or configuration of the logo of a restaurant or a sponsoring organization. They could also be formed in the shape or likeness of a breed of cat, dog or other domesticated or wild animal or bird or almost any other representation a napkin user might desire. They are preferably outlined in a fairly regular, smooth or even sided lateral configuration in order to guard against catching the sides of the figures upon each other as the pieces are rotated laterally into clamping position over or against opposite surfaces of a napkin.</p>
<p id="P-00065" num="00065">Representative illustrations of typical magnetic housings each with encapsulated magnetic pieces, comprised of either small powerful magnets or magnetic lines of force conducting, or concentrating, pole pieces are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2L</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2L</figref> show plastic mountings or housings <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>(See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of various shapes and sizes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is an isometric lateral view of the exterior of an unadorned or undecorated magnetic mounting, or housing, <b>22</b> having a smooth face which will not tear or otherwise damage the surface of a napkin as such napkin is pulled from between the magnetic mountings or housings as shown or illustrated in FIG. <b>6</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref> are isometric views of the two housings or mountings <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>also as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> on both ends of the lanyard <b>16</b>, one of which housings, <b>22</b><i>a</i>, shown partially in phantom, incorporates or has encapsulated therein a magnetizable or magnetic line conducting pole piece <b>40</b> and the other of which <b>22</b><i>b</i>, also shown partially in phantom, incorporates a small powerful magnet <b>44</b> which when within a critical distance of the pole piece <b>40</b> in mounting <b>22</b><i>a </i>will draw the two mountings or housings <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>together with considerable force.</p>
<p id="P-00066" num="00066">When brought close to each other, the strong magnetic field of the magnet induces a similar magnetic field in the metal piece and the two are drawn together in a single magnetic field. In effect, the pole piece becomes a temporary magnet or continuation of a magnet. For this reason, two permanent magnets may also be used as long as their poles are aligned with opposite poles adjacent. Consequently, it is usually more convenient to use a pole piece, since the temporary magnet of a metal pole piece is, in effect, self-aligning. The force exerted upon a normal or average thickness napkin between the two magnetically attractive housings should be sufficient to resist a downward measured force normal or at right angles to the force between the magnetic housings of approximately one quarter to three quarter pounds greater than the weight of the napkin itself, but to release the napkin or let it slide from between the magnetic housings upon a normal force application of extra force of approximately three quarter or more pounds. The force resisted by the napkin normal to the magnetic housings will be essentially the friction developed between the napkin surfaces on both sides with the magnetic housings on both sides and is dependent upon the thickness of the napkin, the surface characteristics of the contacting housing surfaces, the strength of the magnet <b>44</b> and its distance from the pole piece <b>40</b> including the thickness, in addition to the thickness of the napkin, of plastic or polymer overlying the surface of the magnet <b>44</b> and the surface of the pole piece <b>40</b>. The preferable force resisted for a magnetic holder designed for a normal cloth napkin weighing about four ounces or one quarter pound is one half pound to one pound including the weight of the napkin plus or minus one or two ounces.</p>
<p id="P-00067" num="00067">The magnet <b>44</b> and pole piece <b>40</b> are conveniently embedded within or encapsulated within the polymeric housings <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>during hot molding or chemical polymerization of the housing material which may be formed, as familiar to those skilled in the art, of plastic by polymeric molding, i.e. while polymerizing in a mold, by hot molding, i.e. solidifying in a mold or by extrusion into a suitable mold. Such mold must have a smooth internal face on the interior side of the housings and will be arranged for insertion of the magnets and pole pieces into the plastic either before or after filling of the molding chamber with polymer or plastic. While there will preferably be a separate magnet housing and pole piece housing, two opposed magnet housings may also be used making certain that opposite poles of the magnets are arranged to be opposed during use so that the magnets are drawn together rather than repelled from each other. As will be understood, the force between two magnets will be arranged or calculated to be essentially the same as between a pole piece and a magnet contained in opposite housings.</p>
<p id="P-00068" num="00068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> is an isometric lateral view of the outside of a magnetic housing in accordance with the invention showing a depression <b>48</b> in the surface into which a label or the like may be placed, which label may be a so-called domed label or the like. Such depression will normally have a flat bottom. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> shows an isometric lateral view of the front of a similar magnetic housing having an alternative shape depression <b>48</b><i>a </i>in the front side of the housing shown in the shape in this example of a five-pointed star, but which could be virtually any shape. The napkin holders of the invention make attractive souvenirs or promotion items for many organizations such as large or small corporations, other business organizations, military and veteran organizations, fraternal organizations and the like. These can be referred to broadly as societal organizations. The identifying shields for many of such societal organizations are of particular shapes. In each case, however, it is usually desirable for the label or identifying decal, dome label or other indicia be contained in at least a slight depression to minimize the likelihood of removal of said indicia by peeling or the like, either deliberate or accidental.</p>
<p id="P-00069" num="00069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref> is an isometric lateral view of the front side of a magnetic housing having an expanded upper section which can provide an expanded depressed area <b>48</b> for the placement of a suitable logo or the like. Frequently, in all the representations there will be a similar depression on the opposite side of the combined housing, i.e. on the normal inside or inner surface, in which will be placed the Trademark for the item itself or more correctly for identifying the source of the item itself, for example &#x201c;Dresskerchief,&#x201d; the expected Trademark under which the holder of the present invention as well as kits containing the napkin holder and suitable napkins are anticipated as likely to be distributed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> shows in an isometric lateral view of a further alternative shape for one of the magnetic housings in accordance with the invention having a very much expanded upper section plus a rectangular depression for the receipt of a suitable legend, slogan, symbol or whatever the purchaser or distributor may desire. It may be desirable to display the Trademark for the holder of the invention as well as any combined handkerchiefs in depression on the inside surface of one or both pairs of the individual housings of the magnetic holders of the invention.</p>
<p id="P-00070" num="00070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2H and 2I</figref> are sectional side views of a pair of magnetic housings <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>showing and encapsulated pole piece <b>40</b> in housing <b>22</b><i>a </i>and a small powerful magnet encapsulated in housing <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="P-00071" num="00071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref> is a sectional side view of a preferred frontal housing <b>22</b><i>c </i>having a thicker more powerful magnet <b>45</b><i>a </i>and a thicker housing than shown in FIG. <b>2</b>I. This housing <b>22</b><i>c </i>will be combined with the housing <b>22</b><i>a </i>as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>H and as noted is preferred over the housing <b>22</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, especially when heavier napkins are involved.</p>
<p id="P-00072" num="00072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2K and 2L</figref> are sectional side views of a pair of magnetic housings <b>22</b><i>d </i>and <b>22</b><i>e </i>having a pair of magnets <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>encapsulated in them with the poles of the magnets disposed opposite to each other so that the two magnets attract each other rather than repelling each other. Since the attraction of the two magnets <b>22</b><i>d </i>and <b>22</b><i>e </i>is essentially cumulative, assuming that the strength of the magnets is per weight of magnet essentially the same as in the previous examples, the magnets <b>22</b><i>d </i>and <b>22</b><i>e </i>need to be only partly as large as magnets <b>44</b> or <b>45</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2I and 2J</figref>, other things being equal, in order to attain the same magnetic attraction.</p>
<p id="P-00073" num="00073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, which illustrate an alternative construction of housing members <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, respectively, which construction is essentially identical to housing members <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>, the inner and outer sides <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> may be formed of separate pieces or sections which are subsequently permanently joined to form the housing members. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, housing member <b>22</b><i>a </i>is formed of first and second panels <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>b</i>, while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>housing member <b>22</b><i>b </i>is similarly shown formed from first and second panels <b>38</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b</i>. Encapsulated or contained in each housing member <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>is a permanent magnet or magnetically attractive member or attractant, usually a magnetisable metal piece or slug. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, magnetically attractive metal slug <b>40</b> is encapsulated in aperture or cutout portion <b>42</b> in housing member <b>22</b><i>a</i>, while permanent magnet <b>44</b> is encapsulated in cutout portion <b>46</b> in housing member <b>22</b><i>b</i>. In use encapsulated slug <b>40</b> is rotated laterally into position in its housing <b>22</b><i>a </i>immediately adjacent magnet <b>36</b> in housing member <b>22</b><i>a</i>. Such magnets or magnetically attractive members or pole pieces are preferably comprised of thin flat circular discs having a diameter slightly less than the diameter of the housing members, which slugs or discs are aligned with the magnetic north pole of the magnet facing inwardly in holding position and, if two magnets are used, the north pole of the other magnet facing outwardly. A magnetic attraction is therefore effectively provided between the housing members <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, which attraction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, tends to pull or urge the inner faces <b>32</b> of housing members <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>inwardly or towards each other until they are aligned side-by-side. Permanent magnets or magnetically attractive metal slugs are similarly secured in housing members <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>, so that the inner faces <b>32</b> of such members are also held in adjacent or side-by-side alignment when rotated into holding position. Additional magnets or magnetic attraction members may be provided in the housing members if desired. Preferably, sections <b>36</b><i>b </i>and <b>38</b><i>a </i>which form the inner sections of housing members <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, respectively are thinner than outer sections <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>38</b><i>b </i>so that both magnetically attractive member <b>40</b> and magnet <b>44</b> are positioned nearer to the inner surfaces <b>32</b> of the housing members. This may help ensure that the plastic or other material forming gripping members <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> does not interfere with the magnetic attraction, between such members. Very powerful small disk type magnets are commercially available and when combined with an opposed magnetizable metal or other magnetizable material disk can apply a very powerful force. It is for this reason the tabs or housings are slid sidewise at right angles to the magnetic attraction to either slide the tabs into position over the edge of a napkin or to release the napkin if it is not desired to bodily slide such napkin from between the aligned tabs. In the case of the magnets and pole pieces encapsulated in molded housings as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2K</figref> the magnet and pole pieces may also be desirably spaced within the housings nearer the face of the housing designed to contact the napkin between the housings during use.</p>
<p id="P-00074" num="00074">Another feature adding to the desirability of the invention as noted above is that various designs and the like may be placed on the outside surfaces of the housing members <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. Such designs may include, but are not limited to, company names, logos, symbols, insignias, fraternal crests or insignia, band or celebrity names, or other original designs. Such designs may be painted, adhered or otherwise attached to the devices in any manner. However, in one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, a recess <b>48</b> is molded in the surface of the outer side <b>34</b> of housing member <b>22</b><i>b</i>. Such recess <b>48</b> is provided as a receptacle for the attachment, usually by an adhesive, of a flat or domed monogram, team or company logo, or other advertising device. The recess <b>48</b> assists in preventing the edges of the label or adhesive layer from accidentally or intentionally being pulled off the holding device. Recesses may of course typically be provided in the surface of the outer sides of the other holding members, or several smaller recesses may be provided in each holding member to accommodate several advertising or marketing indicias.</p>
<p id="P-00075" num="00075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view of napkin or cloth <b>50</b> secured between housing sections <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>of gripping member <b>12</b>. The magnetic means <b>44</b> and metal attractant or pole piece <b>40</b> are shown in the plastic of the tabs as well as an inserted logo piece <b>48</b> partially embedded on the outer side of the tab <b>22</b><i>b</i>. The magnetic attraction between members <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>together must be strong enough to support napkin <b>50</b> in a position hanging or resting across the chest and torso of the user, such as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. Of particular importance in the present invention is that the finished surface of the inner sides <b>32</b> of each of the housing members <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>is as smooth or friction free as possible. In contrast to other magnetic holding members in the prior art, wherein the inner surfaces are rough or grainy to increase the friction between the device and the item being held by such members, in the present invention it is desired that the surface be smooth so that the napkin or bib does not catch or snag on such surface. This in turn allows the napkin to be unrestrictedly and easily removed from the holding device simply by tugging on the napkin itself, without requiring further manipulation of the holding device or ripping or tearing of the napkin. The inner opposing surfaces of the pairs of gripping members should be substantially flat or planar so they fit intimately against opposite sides of the napkin to attain a good grip upon it. The surfaces could be slightly concave and convex respectively providing a somewhat better grip, but causing possibly more chance of difficulty in rotating the two sections into and out of opposition to each other. The plastic of the housings <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as being transparent so the magnet <b>44</b> and pole piece <b>40</b> can both be seen. Alternatively, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> could be considered cut away to show these two structures. If the plastic is not transparent the embedded or centrally contained magnetic structures would not be visible and housing sections <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>would appear as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in a side view of one of the magnetic securing means of the invention over a napkin similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> except the inside of the magnet and pole piece inside the plastic housings or tabs is not shown and a domed transparent logo arrangement <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> on both outer sides of the magnetic securing tabs or housings of the invention is shown instead. A domed logo is a relatively recent innovation in which a relatively thick transparent plastic covering or dome is placed over a logo, advertisement or picture for which a rich, expensive appearance is desired on upscale goods or documents.</p>
<p id="P-00076" num="00076">To use the device of the invention, lanyard <b>16</b> of the holding device is draped across the back of the neck and over the shoulders of the user. Lanyard <b>16</b> should be long enough so that holding device holds a napkin or bib near the upper chest area of the user, so that such lanyard will typically have a length of approximately 18 inches. The housing members are then separated, preferably by sliding such members sideways or laterally with respect to each other so that the upper ends of a napkin can be inserted between the housing members. The housing members could also be simply pulled apart against the power of the magnetic attraction, although, it is invariably less difficult to simply slide the members apart. To insert the napkin between the separated housing members, it is simply placed against the inner surface of one of such members, usually the inner member containing the pole piece, after which the other housing member is slid back into side by side alignment so that the outer surface of one the housing members is resting against the chest or clothing of the user, the napkin is between the inner surfaces of the housing members, and the outer surface of the other housing member, preferably showing the logo on the outer surface, is visible along the front of the napkin. After the napkin is secured between one of the gripping members, the other side is then attached to the other gripping member so that the napkin is supported by the holding device and extends down along the front of the user's torso or chest, and, if desired, lap area depending upon the dimension of the napkin or other absorbent material. When it is desired to remove the napkin, such as for an intended use such as to mop up a spilled beverage or a like substance, a small amount of generally downward force is applied on the napkin, which will cause it to slip from between the gripping members. The smooth inner surface of the housing members allows the napkin to be unrestrictedly pulled or removed from the device at any time, yet the magnet attraction is strong enough to secure the napkin in place across the chest of the user as long as is desired. The invention being used to hold a bib or napkin in the manner described above eliminates the need to manually tie a napkin around a persons neck, stuff or insert the protective material into a persons shirt, coat, collar, tie, or dress to provide protection from spillage while dining.</p>
<p id="P-00077" num="00077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a packaging or box <b>61</b> having a magnetic napkin holder <b>10</b> in accordance with the invention in one section <b>63</b> of the box and at least one napkin <b>64</b> provided for use with the napkin holder in a second section <b>65</b> of the box or package <b>61</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> two napkins folded into conventional triangular configuration are shown packed side by side and it will be understood the additional napkins may be contained under the two shown. If a plurality of napkins are included in the package usually additional napkin holders <b>10</b> will be included. A lid, not shown, or alternatively shrink-wrap plastic wrapping, may be provided over the box or package <b>61</b>. Preferably at least the top napkin in the package will have an attractive design on it and the magnetic napkin holder will preferably also have an attractive small picture or other preferably domed logo, monogram or the like on one or more outer surfaces. Domed logos <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> are shown on both housings <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Packages such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are attractive not only as general consumer items, but also as premium-type goods provided for advertising purposes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a lid or upper partially transparent cover <b>69</b> having a transparent window made from cellophane or other transparent material so the set of napkins and napkin holder can be viewed from outside the package. Note that the logos on the surface of the holders will be clearly visible from the top. A further convenient and reusable packaging may be provided by placing both the napkins and the magnetic holders in a large resealable plastic envelope such as the so-called &#x201c;zip-lok&#xae;&#x201d; bag.</p>
<p id="P-00078" num="00078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, as noted above, shows one of the ends of the magnetic device from the side as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> showing the napkin between the two tabs, or housings, with domed logos or monograms <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> on the outer surfaces. It can be seen in both FIG. <b>4</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> that the inside contacting surfaces of the tabs are substantially flat so they fit closely against the napkin between them. It will be understood in addition that these surfaces as shown are substantially smooth so the napkin can be easily pulled from between them.</p>
<p id="P-00079" num="00079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows one end of an alternative version of the lanyard of the invention in which the housings <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>instead of being strung directly on the end of the lanyard are pivotable upon a stirrup arrangement or fitting <b>70</b> on the end of the lanyard. While not necessary, such arrangement enables a freer pivoting and also may provide a more fancy and upscale look to the entire device. The pivot member <b>71</b> of the stirrup arrangement or fitting should be somewhat more than just large enough to accommodate the opening in the magnetic tabs or housings so some play in passing the tabs or housings over a napkin is possible. The pivot rod or member <b>71</b> may be held in the stirrup by suitable end fittings <b>74</b>. The stirrup fitting itself may be attached to the end of the lanyard in any suitable manner such as, for example, the compression fitting <b>73</b> which as shown comprises a part of the stirrup fitting. As will be understood, the fitting <b>70</b> may be made from gold or silver or gold or silver-plated metal if a fancier upscale look is desired.</p>
<p id="P-00080" num="00080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows another arrangement for holding the housings <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>on the lanyard <b>16</b> using an intermediate ring <b>81</b> which may be constructed in any suitable manner including a construction like a key ring.</p>
<p id="P-00081" num="00081">Although the present invention is designed to offer a form of protection for one's clothing and apparel while dining, such device is also extremely useful to health care workers. Nursing home patients, hospital patients, seniors, disabled and handicapped persons having a need to wear a napkin or bib while eating or in some instances while being fed by a health care provider could also benefit from the device. Parents with young children can also quickly place a bib on such children either at home or on the road using the device. Upscale establishments, such as four star restaurants, shipboard dining, first class air travelers, are often pampered by waiters, maitre de's and flight attendants would also find the present device useful not only to protect the clothing of diners but also as an means for advertising the establishment, as any logo, symbol, insignia and the like may be placed on the outer sides of the gripping members or even on the lanyard portion of the device. In addition, since the holding device is removable from the napkin or bib, it does not act as a hindrance to laundering of such items if made from a cloth or washable material so that they may used over and over and therefore does not contribute to the serious problem of overburdened landfills in today's society due to the use of multiple throwaway items.</p>
<p id="P-00082" num="00082">It is also important to protect the human body from any adverse effects of magnetism by placement of the encapsulated magnetic housing members across the chest of the user. Typically, only one of the housing members will hold a magnet while the other will hold a magnetically attractive slug. Therefore, the magnet will preferably be placed in the housing member that fits over the front of the napkin during use so that the other housing member is situated between the user and such magnet. Optionally, a protective barrier may be placed on the backside of the housing members to further block the magnetic field. While exposure to minimal magnetic fields is generally not considered harmful, patients having medical conditions such as a pacemaker inserted in the chest cavity or the like are typically instructed to avoid direct contact with such fields if possible as they could change at least temporarily the timing of such device. For this reason it may be desirable to mark the securing device in which the magnet is placed so it can be worn outer most. If the magnet is in the outside housing and the larger diameter pole piece is embedded in the inside housing, the magnetic field extending inwardly will be considerably mitigated. Furthermore, while the magnetic attachments are coupled the magnetic lines of force tend to be concentrated through the magnet and adjacent pole piece or opposed magnet decreasing the magnetic flux in the vicinity.</p>
<p id="P-00083" num="00083">As will be recognized from the above, the magnetic napkin holder of the invention as well as the combined napkin and holder combination of the invention supplied in a package or otherwise provides a very attractive as well as useful appurtenance to dining particularly when particular staining foods or drinks are being ingested or imbibed. The device or combination of the invention is not only highly useful but also attractive in both concept and use of it can be made for a relatively small cost. In fact, the device is useful as an advertising medium which can be given away as premiums, yet may be made of expensive materials with significant decoration so as to become a luxury item where desired.</p>
<p id="P-00084" num="00084">While the present invention on has been described at some length and with some particularity with respect to the several described embodiments, it is not intended that it should be limited to any such particulars or embodiments or any particular embodiment, but it is to be construed with references to the appended claims so as to provide the broadest possible interpretation of such claims in view of the prior art and, therefore, to effectively encompass the intended scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e820" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention concerns a shoe structure, which can be used, for instance, for free time, or for sports, or, more generally speaking, for walking.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">Shoe structures presently used are generally composed of a soft shoe upper connected to a lower shoe sole apt to be in contact with the ground, thus protecting the foot sole. Furthermore, flexible soles are commonly in use, said soles being able to bend, thus allowing to raise the heel relative to the toes, and ensuring comfortable walking.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Since they must guarantee an adequate protection of the foot sole, said known soles are usually made of materials having a certain rigidity. Analogously, known shoe uppers are made of at least a layer of an usually rigid or semi-rigid material, such as e.g. leather, imitation leather or plastic materials, which can be preformed according to a wished shape.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Shoes provided with a soft upper also known, such as for instance shoes with a fabric upper. Said shoes are neither particularly strong nor usually waterproof, and they are commonly used as house shoes, for instance as slippers.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">The main disadvantage of the aforesaid known shoes is that they must be formed as much as possible according to the shape of the user's foot, in order to be comfortably worn. To this aim shoes of different dimensions for feet of different sizes are commercially available.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Furthermore, shoes of known type are also produced in intermediate sizes, namely comprised between two subsequent sizes, in order to allow the user to choose the most comfortable size among those available.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">From the aforesaid it is clear that normal shoes involve some problems for both the producer and the seller, since for the producers, the distributors and, above all, for the sales outlets it is difficult to manage the supplies effectively, which difficulty often implies a reduced choice for the customers.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">From the user's point of view, known shoes are usually never perfectly adaptable to the foot of each single user, since they are made according to production criteria aiming to obtain an average product taking into account several possible foot morphological characteristics. Moreover, the shoe inner volume is constant, whereas the volume taken up by the user's foot can vary, for example according to the thickness of the stocking or according to physiological factors producing swelling of lower limbs with variations of the foot volume during the day. Furthermore, in growing subjects, such as children or adolescents, the foot dimensions vary, even remarkably, in relatively short periods of time, thus making the shoes unusable before the end of their service life determined by wear and aging of the shoe. Finally, it must be considered that, due to the natural morphological asymmetry of the human body, each person is usually provided with a foot (normally the right one) which is slightly bigger than the other. Furthermore, inner shoes for sports shoes are also known, particularly for ski boots or for skates, made of two different elements which are connected by means of a further elastically deformable element. In this way the inner shoe is apt to be used together with a sports shoe provided with a rigid casing, at least longitudinally adjustable in order to allow the shoe to be worn by feet of two or more different sizes. A material disadvantage of this known embodiment is that it can be used only together with a rigid casing acting as a supporting framework. In fact, said inner shoe is not apt to walking, since it is formed by an upper and a sole, possibly integral to each other, made of soft fabric, or in any case not apt to touch the ground and/or to support adequately the foot during walking.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">An object of the present invention is to solve the aforesaid technical problems, thus avoiding the disadvantages of the aforementioned prior art and providing a shoe structure usable with a maximum comfort by persons having feet with different size and shape.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">Within the scope of this aim, one of the objects of the present invention is to provide a shoe structure allowing a remarkable reduction of production, transport and stocking costs.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">Another important object is to provide a shoe sole structure having particular characteristics and framework which allows the production of a shoe with the aforesaid characteristics.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">A further object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a shoe structure having the aforesaid characteristics, said method being easy and economical.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">Another object of the present invention is to provide a shoe structure and a relating production method which is highly reliable, easily executed and with competitive costs.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">These and other objects which will be described in greater detail hereinafter, are achieved by means of a shoe structure comprising a first subset apt to form a foot-containing structure and a second subset which can be coupled to the first subset and apt to isolate, at least partially, the foot sole from the ground; the shoe structure according to the invention is characterized in that said first subset comprises a first insole, at least partially made of an elastically deformable material, and one or more edges, at least partially made of an elastically deformable material, extending from said first insole and forming a shoe upper which can at least partially wrap the foot upper portion, and it is further characterized in that said second subset comprises a supporting framework, at least partially made of an elastically deformable material and having an upper face, which can be coupled to said first subset, and a lower face with one or more inserts which are intended to be in contact with the ground.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">In this way, thanks to its innovative structure, suitably combining subsets at least partially made of an elastically deformable material, the shoe according to the invention can be suited to feet having different dimensions and shape.</p>

<p id="P-00024" num="00024">With a reference to the aforesaid figures, the shoe structure according to the invention comprises a first subset <b>10</b> and a second subset <b>20</b>. The first subset <b>10</b> is apt to form a foot-containing structure, whereas the second subset <b>20</b> can be coupled to the first subset <b>10</b> and is apt to isolate at least partially the foot sole from the ground.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">Said first subset <b>10</b> particularly comprises a first insole <b>11</b>, at least partially made of an elastically deformable material, for example materials commercially available with trade names such as Lycra, Meryl, Cordura or the like, or more in general, materials comprising fibres or fabrics at least partially made of an elastomeric material.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">Above the insole <b>10</b> one or more edges <b>12</b> are extended, at least partially made of an elastically deformable material, which can have different shapes according to the kind of shoe, for instance sneakers, sports shoes, children's shoes, boots, and having a shoe upper which can at least partially wrap the foot upper portion.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">The second subset <b>20</b> comprises a supporting framework <b>21</b>, at least partially made of an elastically deformable material, e. g. natural rubber, or of a PU, TR, PUR elastomer, or of light cross-linked rubbers. This ensures a high elastic deformability of the supporting framework <b>21</b> in longitudinal and/or transversal direction. The supporting framework <b>21</b> has an upper face <b>210</b> which can be coupled to the first subset <b>10</b>, and a lower face <b>211</b> with one or more, preferably a plurality of, inserts <b>22</b> intended to be in contact with the ground. The inserts <b>22</b> can be advantageously made of highly abrasion-resistant materials.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">Preferably, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the edges <b>12</b> are connected to the first insole <b>11</b> corresponding to its outer edge <b>110</b>. The connection between the parts and the insole can be made, for instance, by means of a Strobel sewing made of an at least partially elastic thread, or by glueing, or even by means of a combination of these two methods, or by means of other known methods.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">As previously stated, the edges <b>12</b> are defined and/or assembled together in order to form a shoe upper at least partially wrapping the foot upper portion; however, it is possible that these edges <b>12</b> extend beyond the foot, thus wrapping also a lower portion of the leg, for example obtaining a shoe structure corresponding to a boot. Therefore, the first subset <b>10</b> substantially represents a foot-containing structure which is advantageously elastically deformable both in the longitudinal and in the transversal direction, thus allowing great comfort to the user's foot. Furthermore, a second foot-supporting insole can be advantageously placed inside said first subset.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">Preferably, the shoe structure according to the invention also comprises a heel-supporting element <b>30</b>. Advantageously, a seat <b>32</b> apt to accommodate a shock absorber <b>31</b> is provided in said supporting element <b>30</b>. The supporting element <b>30</b> can advantageously be made of EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) or PU (polyurethane) resin, whereas the element <b>31</b> can be made of, for example, elastomeric gel o similar materials.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">Advantageously, as particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the supporting framework <b>21</b> comprises a basis <b>23</b> and a grid <b>24</b> placed on the lower face <b>211</b> of the basis <b>23</b>. The basis <b>23</b> is at least partially made of an elastically deformable material, and the grid <b>24</b> is also at least partially made of an elastically deformable material which can be the same or different from the material used for the basis <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">As clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the grid <b>24</b> forms on the lower face <b>211</b> of the basis <b>23</b> a plurality of seats apt to accommodate the inserts <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the grid <b>24</b> can be formed by a continuous structure comprising a plurality of segments, all directly or indirectly connected to each other, thus forming a series of spaces which are the seats <b>25</b> of the inserts <b>22</b>. According to an alternative embodiment, not shown in the drawing, the grid <b>24</b> can be formed by a plurality of segments which do not constitute a continuous structure because they are not all connected together, directly or indirectly, but which form a plurality of seats <b>25</b> for said inserts <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">Preferably, the basis <b>23</b> and the grid <b>24</b> are made of the same material and form a single body obtained by moulding.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">The inserts <b>22</b> have preordained shapes and geometrical patterns, and are preferably made of a highly abrasion-resistant material, e.g. ECO (epiclorohydrin), CSM (hypalon), CR (neoprene), SBR (styrene-butadiene) resins or the like. It must be remarked that the inserts <b>22</b> can also show diversified mechanical properties and/or they can be made of different materials according to the corresponding foot area where they must be placed and according to the use foreseen for the shoe.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">For example, if the shoe is intended for sports, the inserts placed in a position corresponding to the foot sole can have a higher thickness and/or rigidity if compared to the inserts which must be placed in a position corresponding to the arch of the foot. Furthermore, always as an example, the abrasion-resistant characteristics of sneakers can be different from those of sports shoes.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">Advantageously, a part of the inserts <b>22</b> can be at least partially made of elastomeric material. In this case, the correct positioning of these at least partially elastomeric inserts <b>220</b>, for example in the heel area, allows them to work as shock absorbers.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">The second subsets <b>20</b> having a structure of the aforesaid kind form a definitely innovative shoe sole structure and are an integral part of the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">In fact, according to a particular aspect, the present invention also concerns a shoe sole structure comprising a supporting framework <b>21</b>, at least partially made of an elastically deformable material and having an upper face <b>210</b> which can be coupled to the body of said shoe and a lower face <b>211</b> with a plurality of inserts <b>22</b> which are intended to be in contact with the ground.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">As previously stated, the supporting framework <b>21</b> preferably comprises a basis <b>23</b> and a grid <b>24</b> placed on its lower face <b>211</b>. The grid <b>24</b> forms a plurality of seats <b>25</b> apt to accommodate said inserts <b>22</b> and is preferably made as a single piece with said basis <b>23</b>. Both the basis <b>23</b> and the grid <b>24</b> are at least partially made of an elastically deformable material, therefore ensuring a high elastic deformability in the longitudinal and/or transversal direction to the sole structure according to the invention.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">At least a part of the inserts <b>22</b> are made of a highly abrasion-resistant material, as previously described. Moreover, a part of the inserts <b>22</b> can perform the aforesaid shock-adsorbing function by means of a suitable choice of the elastomeric materials constituting said inserts and by means of their correct positioning.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">The assembling of the shoe structure according to the present invention foresees that the first subset <b>10</b> is connected to the second subset <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, said connection can be advantageously carried out by a direct coupling of the first insole <b>11</b> to the upper face <b>210</b> of said supporting framework <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">According to an embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the heel-supporting element <b>30</b> is placed between said first insole <b>11</b> and the upper face <b>210</b> of said supporting framework. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the heel-supporting element <b>30</b> can be placed inside said first subset <b>10</b>, in a position corresponding to the internal surface of the fist insole <b>11</b>; if also the second insole is present, the supporting element <b>30</b> is preferably interposed between said second insole and the first insole <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">According to a further particular aspect, the present invention also concerns a method for the production of a shoe structure as previously defined. In fact, it has been remarked that the use of suitable measures and of a suitable assembling sequence allows the production of a shoe structure according to the invention in a particularly easy, quick and economical way.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">Therefore, a further object of the present invention is a method for providing the aforesaid shoe structure characterized in that it comprises, in any order, the following steps:

<p id="P-00065" num="00065">The method according to the present invention will be described hereinafter with a reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which schematically shows some steps performed in said method.</p>
<p id="P-00066" num="00066">Step a) comprises a step a.1) defining a shoe upper which can at least partially wrap the foot upper portion by means of a suitable dimensioning and/or assembling of one or more edges <b>12</b> and a step a.2) defining an insole <b>11</b>. Both the edges <b>12</b> and the insole <b>11</b> are at least partially made of elastically deformable materials. Steps a.1) and a.2) can be carried out in any order.</p>
<p id="P-00067" num="00067">Thereafter, step a.3) foresees that the insole <b>11</b> is assembled to the edges <b>12</b>, for example by means of a Strobel sewing with an at least partially elastic thread, thus obtaining a foot-containing structure which is elastically deformable both in the longitudinal and in the transversal direction.</p>
<p id="P-00068" num="00068">Step b) comprises a step b.1) of providing one or more inserts <b>22</b> having predefined shapes and geometrical patterns and preferably made of the previously described materials; said providing advantageously takes place by means of a moulding process, preferably by means of an open mould.</p>
<p id="P-00069" num="00069">Furthermore, step b) comprises a step b.2) for providing a supporting framework <b>21</b> at least partly made of an elastically deformable material. As previously stated, the supporting framework <b>21</b> comprises a basis <b>23</b> and a grid <b>24</b> forming a plurality of seats <b>25</b> apt to accommodate the inserts <b>22</b>. The grid <b>24</b> can be formed as a single element with the basis <b>23</b> by means of a single moulding step, or separately by means of several subsequent moulding steps. Steps b.1) and b.2) can be carried out in any order.</p>
<p id="P-00070" num="00070">Afterwards, step b.3) foresees the assembling between the supporting framework <b>21</b> and the inserts <b>22</b>. Said assembling preferably takes place by hot pressing in an open mould and is followed by a step b.4) wherein the thus obtained structure is vulcanised. Step b) thus allows to produce a sole structure which is advantageously elastically deformable, both in the longitudinal and in the transversal direction.</p>
<p id="P-00071" num="00071">Steps a) and b) can be carried out in any order. Successively, step c) foresees the assembling of the subsets <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, respectively obtained from steps a) and b).</p>
<p id="P-00072" num="00072">Preferably, step c) foresees a first step c.1) wherein a third supporting insole <b>111</b> is connected to the subset <b>10</b> in the position corresponding to the internal surface of the first insole <b>11</b>. Step c.1) is particularly advantageous, since the third insole <b>111</b>, during the steps preparing the assembling of the containing structure <b>10</b> and the sole <b>20</b>, avoids the curl of the structure <b>10</b> because of the effect of the elastic materials used for the edges <b>12</b> and for the insole <b>11</b>. The third insole <b>111</b> advantageously consists of an inextensible material and its assembling to the subset <b>10</b> preferably takes place together with the assembling of the insole <b>11</b> to the edges <b>12</b>. Afterwards, with step c.2), the first and the second subset <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are assembled together, thus forming a shoe structure according to the invention. In case, at the end it is foreseen a step c.3) for removing the third supporting insole <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00073" num="00073">In the practice it has been observed that the shoe structure, the sole structure and the method according to the invention fully perform the predetermined task, giving remarkable advantages and improvements if compared with the prior art. In fact, as previously described, the shoe structure according to the invention is advantageously elastically extensible both in the longitudinal and in the transversal direction, thus allowing its comfortable use with feet having different dimensions and shapes. It is thus guaranteed a certain comfort to the user and, at the same time, the reduction of the aforesaid logistic problems concerning production, stocking, transport and sale. If the user is a growing subject, the extensibility of the shoe structure according to the invention allows the shoe to follow the foot in its development for a time longer than that allowed by normal footwear, thus prolonging the period of use of said shoe.</p>
<p id="P-00074" num="00074">The particular shoe sole structure according to the invention allows, thanks to the combined presence of the supporting framework and of the inserts, a good longitudinal and/or transversal extensibility and at the same time an adequate protection of the foot sole and an adequate comfort and efficiency during walking.</p>
<p id="P-00075" num="00075">Finally, the method of production of a shoe structure according to the invention turns out to be particularly advantageous because it allows the separate production of the two subsets and their successive assembling according to an easy and economical sequence, thus minimizing the required steps.</p>
<p id="P-00076" num="00076">The devised sole structure, shoe structure and method can be subjected to modifications and variations, all within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, all details can be replaced by technically equivalent elements. In the practice, any material, provided that it is compatible with the specific use, and any dimension is allowed, according to the requirements and the state of the art.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e958" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">This disclosure relates in general to the field of computers, and more particularly to a system and method for power management of a computer with a vapor-cooled processor.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e968" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Information handling systems include processors, which produce heat. In information handling systems such as desktop computers, the heat produced by the processors is typically managed with the air cooling. However, as air cooling has inherent limitations that may be exceeded by microprocessors that are increasingly dense and powerful.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">The cooling requirements of some information handling systems, such as over clocker-type systems, require active cooling. One type of active cooling system used for these systems to provide the necessary cooling capacity are compression refrigeration systems, require active cooling. One type of active cooling system used for these systems to provide the necessary cooling capacity are compression refrigeration systems. This enhanced cooling capacity allows systems with over-clocked microprocessors to operate at CPU frequencies above the rated specification.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">In systems that utilize active refrigeration systems, the refrigeration systems are typically activated prior to activating the system. Additionally, those systems typically interlock the computer system to the refrigeration system to prevent operation of the computer system without operating the refrigeration system. Active refrigeration systems require significant power resources, increasing operational costs. These operational costs are particularly high for systems that are operated continuously. Operation of an active refrigeration system typically creates a significant amount of noise, which may negatively effect the operation and efficiency of the microprocessor or other components of the system.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e993" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Thus, a need has arisen for a system and method for efficiently implementing a vapor-cooled system for heat dissipation in an information handling system.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">A further need has arisen for a system and method for reducing the noise and power consumption associated with cooling and operating an information handling system.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">In accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure, the disadvantages and problems associated with power management of a vapor-cooled processor have been substantially reduced or eliminated. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, a dual mode cooling system for an information handling system includes a heat exchanger for receiving heat generated by the information handling system. The system further includes a condenser in communication with the heat exchanger such that the heat received at the heat exchanger is transferred to the condenser. The heat exchanger and the condenser are able to selectively operate in an active cooling mode and a passive cooling mode.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">In another embodiment, an information handling system using power management controls for a dual mode cooling system includes a processor disposed within the information handling system, the processor operable to process information. The information handling system also includes a dual mode cooling system having a heat exchanger and a condenser that are able to selectively operate in an active cooling mode and a passive cooling mode. The heat exchanger is thermally coupled to the processor and the heat exchanger includes a refrigerant line extending therethrough. The heat exchanger transfers heat generated by the processor to a refrigerant flowing in the refrigerant line. The condenser is in communication with the heat exchanger such that the refrigerant is able to flow to the condenser wherein the heat transferred to the refrigerant is expelled at the condenser. The information handling system further includes a power management control coupled to the information handling system. The power management control selectively activates the passive cooling mode and the active cooling mode of the dual mode cooling system.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">In a further embodiment, a method for cooling an information handling system using a dual mode cooling system includes receiving heat generated by at least on component in an information handling system at a heat exchanger. The method transfers the heat to a condenser such that the condenser expels the heat from the information handling system. The method also monitors an operating condition of the information handling system with a power management control. Based on the operating condition, the method automatically operates the heat exchanger and condenser in either a passive cooling mode or an active cooling mode.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">The present disclosure contains a number of important technical advantages. One technical advantage is an efficient operation of an information handling system using a dual mode cooling system. Because the dual mode cooling system selectively operates in either an active cooling mode or a passive cooling mode, the cooling system can reduce the operational costs by utilizing the passive cooling mode, while conserving power resources. The dual mode cooling system typically uses a power management control to monitor a component in the information handling system, such as a processor, when selecting whether to operate in the active cooling mode or the passive cooling mode. Thus, the information handling system may operate more efficiently by using a dual mode cooling system.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">A further technical advantage includes a system and method that provides efficient cooling for an information handling system while generating less noise. Previous cooling system used a vapor compression system that required the cooling system be operational whenever the information handling system was operating. By using a dual mode cooling system with a passive cooling mode, the information handling system can deactivate the active cooling mode and operate in the passive cooling mode. As such, the noise associated with operating a compressor in the active cooling mode can be reduced.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">All, some, or none of these technical advantages may be present in various embodiments of the present invention. Other technical advantages will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.</p>

<p id="P-00023" num="00023">For purposes of this disclosure, an information handling system may include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute, classify, process, transmit, receive, retrieve, originate, switch, store, display, manifest, detect, record, reproduce, handle, or utilize any form of information, intelligence, or data for business, scientific, control, or other purposes. For example, an information handling system may be a personal computer, a network storage device, or any other suitable device and may vary in size, shape, performance, functionality, and price. The information handling system may include random access memory (RAM), one or more processing resources such as a central processing unit (CPU) or hardware or software control logic, ROM, and/or other types of nonvolatile memory. Additional components of the information handling system may include one or more disk drives, one or more network ports for communicating with external devices, as well as various input and output (I/O) devices, such as a keyboard, a mouse, and a video display. The information handling system may also include one or more buses operable to transmit communications between the various hardware components.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of information handling system <b>10</b> using dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> including power management controls <b>15</b>. Dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> generally includes condenser <b>16</b> and heat exchanger <b>20</b> that are selectively operated in either an active cooling mode or a passive cooling mode. Typically, the mode of operation is controlled by power management control <b>15</b>. Based on a mode of operation, dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> may be selectively operated in an active cooling mode or a passive cooling mode.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">Power management control <b>15</b> is generally coupled to information handling system <b>10</b> but also may be a separate control system that is used to monitor one or more components within information handling system <b>10</b>. Power management control <b>15</b> may include computer programs, processors, sensors or any other device operable to selectively activate the active cooling mode or the passive cooling mode of dual mode cooling system <b>11</b>. In certain embodiments, power management control <b>15</b> monitors the activity of information handling system <b>10</b> to determine whether to operate the active cooling mode or the passive cooling mode of dual mode cooling system <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">Condenser <b>16</b> generally receives heat generated by a component, such as processor <b>30</b>, within information handling system <b>10</b> via a refrigerant flowing in refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Within condenser <b>16</b>, the heat within the refrigerant is expelled outside of information handling system <b>10</b>. After the refrigerant passes through condenser <b>16</b>, the refrigerant enters refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>b </i>and returns to heat exchanger <b>20</b> via refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">Heat exchanger <b>20</b>, which may also be known as an evaporator, transfers the heat generated by processor <b>30</b> to the refrigerant. The heat generated by processor <b>30</b> typically varies depending upon the processes being performed by information handling system <b>10</b>. Thus, the greater the process power required by information handling system <b>10</b>, processor <b>30</b> generates a greater amount of heat. As such, the amount of heat transferred to the refrigerant in heat exchanger <b>20</b> varies. Once the heat is transferred, the refrigerant leaves heat exchanger <b>20</b> via refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>d </i>to enter condenser <b>16</b> via refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">In some embodiments, dual mode cooling system may further include compressor <b>14</b>. Generally, when operating in the active cooling mode, compressor <b>14</b> may be activated to interact with the refrigerant received via refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>d </i>that exits heat exchanger <b>20</b>. As such, compressor <b>14</b> may receive a refrigerant in a vapor phase, liquid phase or vapor-liquid phase via refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>d</i>. Compressor <b>14</b> can be used to drive the refrigerant in a closed loop cooling system such that the heat generated by a component, such as processor <b>30</b>, in information handling system <b>10</b> can be removed. During the compression of the refrigerant, the refrigerant is typically compressed to a higher pressure and temperature.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Generally, the amount of energy needed to cool a component in information handling system <b>10</b> is dependent on the amount of cooling required. Basically, the faster and more powerful microprocessor used in information handling system <b>10</b> usually requires the use of a high capacity cooling system that consumes large amounts of power. In some instances, these high capacity cooling systems may use large compressors that generate high levels of noise when compressing the refrigerant.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">However, when operating in a passive cooling mode, dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> may include compressor bypass valve <b>22</b>. Compressor bypass valve <b>22</b> may be activated or actuated from power management control <b>15</b>. Concurrent to the activation of compressor bypass valve <b>22</b>, power management control <b>15</b> may deactivate the operation of compressor <b>14</b>. Compressor bypass valve <b>22</b> may include a switchable valve that is activated or switched using power management control <b>15</b> to allow the refrigerant to bypass compressor <b>14</b>. For example, compressor bypass valve <b>22</b> actuated via a pneumatic, an electronic, a magnetic, a mechanical, a manual device or any other suitable device operable to actuate a valve.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">When activated, compressor bypass valve <b>22</b> may receive the refrigerant coming from heat exchanger <b>20</b> via refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>d </i>by entering refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>e</i>. Generally, when the refrigerant is flowing through refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>e</i>, compressor <b>14</b> is deactivated such that the refrigerant is blocked from passing through compressor <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">Dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> may also include expansion valve assembly <b>18</b>. When operating in the active cooling mode, expansion valve assembly typically includes solenoid valve <b>19</b> and capillary tube <b>21</b>. Solenoid valve <b>19</b> meters the flow of refrigerant through refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>b </i>to refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>c </i>to control the supply or flow of refrigerant to heat exchanger <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">Capillary tube <b>21</b>, generally downstream of solenoid valve <b>19</b>, functions to release the pressure of the refrigerant flowing or passing through capillary tube <b>21</b> such as in a throttling process. Examples of capillary tube <b>21</b> include a partially open valve, a porous media, a line restriction or any device suitable to provide a desired drop or restriction within refrigerant line <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">During the throttling process, the refrigerant generally undergoes a phase change by expanding the refrigerant that may be in a saturated liquid state to a lower pressure. In some instances, some or all of the refrigerant may transform from a liquid phase to a vapor phase that is associated with the drop in pressure. Further associated with the drop in pressure, the temperature of the refrigerant will also decrease in the throttling process. As such, the refrigerant leaving expansion valve assembly <b>18</b> may be in vapor or liquid-vapor phase as it enters heat exchanger <b>20</b> via refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">However, when operating in a passive cooling mode, dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> may further include expansion bypass valve <b>24</b>. Expansion bypass valve <b>24</b> may be activated or actuated from power management control <b>15</b>. Concurrent to the activation of expansion bypass valve <b>24</b>, power management control <b>15</b> may deactivate the operation of expansion valve assembly <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">When activated, expansion bypass valve <b>24</b> may receive the refrigerant coming from condenser <b>16</b> via refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>b </i>by entering refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>f</i>. Generally, when the refrigerant is flowing through refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>f</i>, expansion valve <b>18</b> is deactivated such that the refrigerant is blocked from passing through expansion valve assembly <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The refrigerant used in dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> includes inert materials that are used to transfer heat from the information handling system. Examples of refrigerants include ammonia, Freon such as R-12, R-22 and R-134a, carbon dioxide, methyl chloride, sulfur dioxide, water, air, methanol, fluorocarbons, n-triacontane water emulsions, nitrogen, fluorinert, any combination thereof or any suitable material or medium that is capable of transferring heat from a component in information handling system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">When operating in the passive cooling mode, dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> may function as a basic thermo-siphon system. As such, refrigerant lines <b>12</b> may include heat pipes or thermal tubes to move heat to the refrigerant or move the refrigerant through dual mode cooling system <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">In another example embodiment, the passive cooling mode of dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> utilizes gravity to drive the refrigerant within refrigerant lines <b>12</b>. When the refrigerant is in a liquid state, gravity causes the refrigerant to collect or gather at the lowest point of information handling system <b>10</b>, generally at heat exchanger <b>20</b>, such that the refrigerant comes into contact a heat source, such as processor <b>30</b>. As the heat is transferred to the refrigerant, the refrigerant begins to move within heat exchanger <b>20</b> typically due to convection and in some instances the refrigerant vaporizes. As the heated refrigerant rises and moves within dual mode cooling system <b>11</b>, the refrigerant may be cooled upon reaching condenser <b>16</b> or within refrigerant lines <b>12</b>. At this point, the refrigerant may re-condense into a liquid phase and return via gravity to heat exchanger <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates processor <b>30</b> in information handling system <b>10</b> coupled to heat exchanger <b>20</b>. An example of heat exchanger <b>20</b> may include an evaporator. Heat exchanger <b>20</b> includes a flow path for refrigerant line <b>12</b> such that the refrigerant may be received from refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>c </i>and after passing through heat exchanger <b>20</b> exits via refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>d</i>. While the refrigerant pass through heat exchanger <b>20</b>, the heat from processor <b>30</b> is transferred to the refrigerant.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">Typically, processor <b>30</b> is disposed adjacent to heat exchanger <b>20</b> and uses interface material <b>32</b> such as a thermal paste to facilitate the transfer of heat from processor <b>30</b> to the refrigerant pass through heat exchanger <b>20</b>. As such, the transfer of heat to the refrigerant that is moving through heat exchanger <b>20</b> may be performed while dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> is operating in the active cooling mode or in the passive cooling mode.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic view of another example embodiment of dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> including liquid loop cooling system <b>33</b> to enable a passive cooling mode. In some embodiments, dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> includes liquid loop cooling system <b>33</b> having a second refrigerant line that flows through dual path heat exchanger <b>40</b> and dual path condenser <b>44</b>. Typically, liquid loop cooling system <b>33</b> includes liquid lines <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>that are fluidly isolated from refrigerant line <b>12</b> to operate in a passive cooling mode.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">When operating in the passive cooling mode, dual path heat exchanger <b>40</b> may receive a second refrigerant such as a cooling liquid via liquid line <b>42</b><i>b</i>. Because dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> is operating in the passive cooling mode, power management control <b>15</b> generally deactivates compressor <b>14</b>, which prevents the flow of refrigerant through refrigerant lines <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, <b>12</b><i>c </i>and <b>12</b><i>d</i>. With the transfer of heat from processor <b>30</b> to the cooling liquid moving through dual path heat exchanger <b>40</b>, the cooling liquid is communicated to dual path condenser <b>44</b> via liquid line <b>42</b><i>a</i>. As the cooling liquid passes through dual path condenser <b>44</b>, the heat is removed from the cooling liquid and expelled from information handling system <b>10</b>, wherein the cooling liquid is circulated back to dual path heat exchanger <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">Generally, liquid loop cooling system <b>33</b> utilizes pump <b>47</b> to drive the cooling liquid through liquid lines <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b</i>. As such, pump <b>47</b> may be placed along any portion of liquid line <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>such that the cooling liquid can be pumped through liquid loop cooling system <b>33</b>. Because pump <b>47</b> is connected with the passive cooling mode of dual mode cooling system <b>11</b>, the activation of pump <b>47</b> is typically controlled via power management control <b>15</b> and thus is deactivated when operating in the active cooling mode.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, dual path heat exchanger <b>40</b> may provide two flow paths for operating in the different cooling modes, namely the passive cooling mode and the active cooling mode. Dual path heat exchanger <b>40</b> may be coupled to processor <b>30</b> via interface material <b>32</b> to facilitate the transfer of heat from processor <b>30</b> to the refrigerant or cooling liquid moving through dual path heat exchanger <b>40</b> via refrigerant line <b>12</b> and liquid line <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates dual path condenser <b>44</b> including cooling fins <b>46</b>. In order to provide efficient cooling or removal of heat from information handling system <b>10</b>, dual path condenser <b>44</b> includes cooling fins <b>46</b> to facilitate in the transfer of heat from the refrigerant or cooling liquid flowing through dual path condenser <b>44</b>. Although not shown, cooling fins <b>46</b> may also be formed on condenser <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">Similar to dual path heat exchanger <b>40</b>, dual path condenser <b>44</b> may operate in either a passive cooling mode or an active cooling mode as controlled or selected via power management control <b>15</b>. In the active cooling mode, the refrigerant generally enters dual path condenser via refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>a </i>and exits via refrigerant line <b>12</b><i>b</i>. In the passive cooling mode, cooling liquid generally enters dual path condenser via liquid line <b>42</b><i>a </i>and exits via liquid line <b>42</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">Whether operating in the active or passive cooling mode, dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> may utilize cooling fan <b>48</b> to provide additional cooling to cooling fins <b>46</b> and dual mode condenser <b>44</b> by using forced convection to move air across cooling fins <b>46</b>. Cooling fan <b>48</b> may be controlled or activated via power management controls <b>15</b> in response to operating in the passive cooling mode or active cooling mode.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a flowchart for power management of dual mode refrigeration system <b>11</b> used with information handling system <b>10</b>. At step <b>50</b>, the method cools information handling system <b>10</b> by operating dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> in an active cooling mode such as using a refrigeration system. In one embodiment, dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> includes condenser <b>16</b> and heat exchanger <b>20</b> that may be selectively activated or controlled using power management control <b>15</b> in order to operate in either a passive cooling mode or an active cooling mode.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">At step <b>52</b>, the method monitors an operating condition of information handling system <b>10</b> using power management control <b>15</b>. An example of an operating condition includes monitoring the temperature of one or more of the devices or components within information handling system <b>10</b>. For instance, the temperature of processor <b>30</b> can be monitored such that dual mode cooling system operates in an active cooling mode when the temperature is above a certain temperature level. As such, when the temperature of processor <b>30</b> falls below the certain temperature level, dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> may be selectively activated to operate in the passive cooling mode via power management control <b>15</b>, as shown at step <b>54</b>. Typically, when power management control <b>15</b> activates the passive cooling mode of dual mode cooling system <b>11</b>, the active cooling mode is deactivated or prevented from operating.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">Another operating condition of information handling system <b>10</b> that may be monitored by power management control <b>15</b> includes operating information handling system <b>10</b> in a low power state. Typically, when information handling system <b>10</b> is operating but is not being used, information handling system <b>10</b> may activate a power management program such that the system begins to operate in a low power state. At such time, power management control <b>15</b> may recognize this operating condition and cause dual mode cooling system <b>11</b> to operation in a passive cooling mode.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">A further example of an operating condition that may be monitored by power management control <b>15</b> includes a failure of the active cooling mode in dual mode cooling system <b>11</b>. Because the active cooling mode of dual mode cooling system may include several cooling components that are more susceptible to failure, the active cooling mode may become inoperable. For example, compressor <b>14</b> may be a vital component in the active cooling mode (e.g., used to circulate the refrigerant) such that failure of compressor <b>14</b> may cause the active cooling mode to become ineffective. After determining a failure of the active cooling mode, power management control <b>15</b> can selectively activate the passive cooling mode and, in some instances, notify a user of the failure.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">As previously discussed, the passive cooling mode may include the activation of compressor bypass valve <b>22</b> and/or the activation of expansion bypass valve <b>24</b>. When operating in the active cooling mode, power management control <b>15</b> may be used to deactivate compressor bypass valve <b>22</b> and/or expansion bypass valve <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">Although the present disclosure has been described with respect to a specific embodiment, various changes and modifications will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art. The present disclosure is not limited to the illustrated embodiment, but encompasses such changes and modifications that fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">While a workpiece is heated and pressed by one of a pair of high-pressure vessels, a workpiece being pressed by the other high-pressure vessel is placed in a heated state. In the reducing process after termination of heating and pressing treatment of the workpiece by one high-pressure vessel, both the high-pressure vessels are placed in communication, and the pressure medium gas released from one high-pressure vessel is poured into the other high-pressure vessel. After pressures of both the high-pressure vessels have assumed a nearly balanced state, the pressure medium gas is sucked out of one high-pressure vessel by a compressor and pressed, and is poured into the other high-pressure vessel, and the workpiece is heated and pressed by the other high-pressure vessel. By the method as described, considerable shortening of cycle time of HIP treatment is achieved, and the HIP treatment can be carried out with high efficiency.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e589" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention relates to a hot isostatic pressing apparatus (HIP apparatus) for economically performing a treatment of a large quantity of products capable being carried under the atmospheric pressure in the heated state such as Al cast products Mg cast products or the like and whose hot isostatic pressing treatment (HIP treatment) temperature is not more than 600&#xb0; C., and particularly to a method and apparatus wherein two high-pressure vessels are combined and operation is carried out whereby pressing and pressure reducing are carried out in a short period of time to realize shortening of cycle time and to improve economic properties of the HIP treatment.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">The problem on industrial popularization of the HIP treatment of cast pieces of light-alloy metal materials such as Al and Mg which are objects of the present invention basically lies in economic properties, that is, treatment costs. In the cost of the HIP treatment, the treatment cost is very high due to long cycle time. The present invention aims at shortening the cycle time and improvement of economic properties resulting from improvement of apparatus utilizing efficiency. The related art proposed to improve the HIP treatment technique from a viewpoint of the foregoing and the problem thereof will be explained hereinafter.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">A compressor for pressing a pressure medium gas, a reducing device for reducing pressure, and various valves are also expensive. There has been also proposed a method in which a pressing and reducing system constituted of these (expensive) parts is by 20 to 40% in operating time at one cycle, and therefore, a plurality of high-pressure vessels are connected to the pressing and reducing system, and operation is carried out so as to shift an operating phase to reduce stop-time of the compressor whereby the apparatus price is relatively reduced (see FIG. 12, Japanese Patent Publication No. 23484/1995).</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">The above-proposed HIP apparatus <b>67</b> comprises, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, two high-pressure vessels <b>68</b>, and a pressing/reducing system <b>72</b> provided with a gas cylinder <b>69</b>, a gas compressor <b>70</b>, a reducing device <b>71</b> and many valves, whereby the start time of cycle motion in the high-pressure vessels <b>68</b> is shifted. When in one high-pressure vessel <b>68</b>, heating/pressing treatment of work-pieces is carried out, pressing/recovering process of the pressure medium gas is carried out in the other high-pressure vessel <b>68</b> to thereby enhance working efficiency of the HIP apparatus <b>67</b>. The single pressing/reducing system <b>72</b> is operated relative to the two high-pressure vessels <b>68</b>, and the start time of cycle motion in each high-pressure vessel <b>68</b> is shifted, thus achieving the improvement of efficiency of the HIP treatment.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">However, in the technique described in the above Japanese Patent Publication No. 23484/1995, the pressure medium gas is supplied from the gas cylinder <b>69</b> to one high-pressure vessel <b>68</b> by the gas compressor <b>70</b>, and afterwards, the pressure medium gas is recovered to the gas cylinder <b>69</b> from the other high-pressure vessel <b>68</b> by the gas compressor <b>70</b>. Therefore, during the time when one high-pressure vessel <b>68</b> is elevated in pressure, the other high-pressure vessel <b>68</b> cannot be reduced in pressure. Accordingly, this poses a problem that the portion cannot shorten the cycle time of the HIP treatment.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">It is noted that the HIP apparatus <b>67</b> described in the above Japanese Patent Publication No. 23484/1995 discloses that after termination of the HIP treatment in one high-pressure vessel <b>68</b>, the valves <b>73</b> and <b>74</b> are opened to communicate both the high-pressure vessels <b>68</b> each other, whereby a high-pressure argon gas is introduced from one high-pressure vessel <b>68</b> to the other high-pressure vessel <b>68</b> to shorten the pressing time. However, there is not disclosed a method in which after pressures within both the high-pressure vessels <b>68</b> assume a balanced state, the other high-pressure vessel <b>68</b> (a high-pressure vessel supplied with the argon gas) is elevated to the HIP treatment pressure.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Further, the technique described in the above Japanese Patent Publication No. 23484/1995 for connecting in common the pressing/reducing system <b>72</b> to the plurality of high-pressure vessels <b>68</b> describes nothing about the state of temperatures within the high-pressure vessel <b>68</b>. As will be carried out here, where gases are supplied at high speed making use of a pressure difference between the HIP treatment vessel in the high-pressure state and the HIP treatment vessel intended to elevate pressure thereafter, a temperature-elevating phenomenon due to so-called damming occurs whereby a temperature above the treatment chamber of the HIP treatment vessel intended to elevate pressure thereafter excessively rises. Thereby, in the control of electric power input into a heater, a temperature distribution which is difficult to control temperature occurs. In workpieces formed of a material which is difficult in temperature control, that is, variation in temperature of the workpieces becomes so great as to require heat treatment, it is difficult to secure the expected mechanical characteristics. It is impossible to avoid this problem, and it is difficult to carry out the stabilized HIP treatment to which is attached importance of uniform temperature. It is an object of the present invention to solve the aforementioned problems.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e842" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">The technical means taken by the present invention to solve the technical problem provides a hot isostatic pressing method for heating/pressing a workpiece using a pair of high-pressure vessels and using a pressure medium gas. The method comprises the steps of: heating and pressing workpieces in a first high-pressure vessel which is one of the pair of high-pressure vessels; placing a workpiece in a heating state in a second high-pressure vessel which is the other thereof, while heating and pressing the workpieces in the first high-pressure vessel; reducing the internal pressure of the first high-pressure vessel, after termination of heating and pressing of the workpieces in the first high-pressure vessel; pressing the interior of the second high-pressure vessel, while reducing the internal pressure of the first high-pressure vessel; and heating and pressing the workpieces in the second high-pressure vessel. In the above process, the step of pressing the interior of the second high-pressure vessel and reducing the internal pressure of the first high-pressure comprises communicating the interior of the first high-pressure vessel with the interior of the second high-pressure vessel to thereby pour the pressure medium gas released from the first high-pressure vessel into the second high-pressure vessel; and sucking out the pressure medium gas from the first high-pressure vessel by a compressor and pouring the pressure medium gas pressed by the compressor into the second high-pressure vessel, after internal pressure of the first high-pressure vessel and internal pressure of the second high-pressure vessel have assumed a nearly balanced state.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">The cycle time of the HIP treatment is considerably shortened, and the HIP treatment can be carried out with high efficiency, by the method as described above.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">In the above-described hot isostatic pressing method, in the step of reducing the internal pressure of the first high-pressure vessel, the interior of the first high-pressure vessel can be heated so as to suppress lowering of temperature within the first high-pressure vessel.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">Thereby, it is possible to avoid the problem that the pressure medium gas within the high-pressure vessel on the supply side is lowered in temperature to substantially lower the pressure.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">In the above-described hot isostatic pressing method, a base heater and a fan for supplying and stirring the pressure medium gas within a treatment chamber for heating and pressing workpieces can be arranged downward of a workpiece in the first high-pressure vessel, and the base heater and the fan can be operated so as to provide a uniform temperature in the interior of the first high-pressure vessel, in said step of reducing the internal pressure of the first high-pressure vessel.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Thereby, it is possible to suppress the temperature variation (occurrence of temperature distribution) caused by temperature elevation due to damming which occurs where the pressure medium gas is poured into the high-pressure vessel at high speeds, or it is possible to suppress the temperature-lowering (occurrence of temperature distribution) caused by the adiabatic expansion which occurs where the pressure medium gas within the high-pressure vessel is discharged at high speeds to contribute to the shortening of the cycle time of the HIP treatment.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">In the above-described hot isostatic pressing method, it is suitable that said pressure medium gas is nitrogen. Since nitrogen is small in compressive property by 5 to 10% as compared with argon, nitrogen is used as the pressure medium gas used to heat and press the workpieces whereby less gas quantity necessary for pressing to the same pressure as argon gas normally used will suffice to enable the effect of shortening the pressing time. Further, since nitrogen gas is cheaper than argon gas, the cost of the HIP treatment can be lowered.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">In the above-described hot isostatic pressing method, the workpiece can be aluminum or an aluminum alloy.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">Further, a hot isostatic pressing apparatus for carrying out the above-described hot isostatic pressing apparatus comprises: a first and a second high-pressure vessels having means for heating the interior thereof, pressure medium gas supply means for supplying the pressure medium gas to the first and second high-pressure vessels; a compressor; a first gas passage for communicating the first high-pressure vessel with the second high-pressure vessel; a second gas passage for communicating the first high-pressure vessel with a discharge side of the compressor; a third gas passage for communicating the second high-pressure vessel with a discharge side of the compressor; a fourth gas passage for communicating the first high-pressure vessel with an intake side of the compressor; and a fifth gas passage for communicating the second high-pressure vessel with an intake side of the compressor. Here, the first to fifth gas passages and the compressor are possible to assume at least the following states: a first state in which all the first to fifth gas passages are closed, and the compressor is stopped; a second state in which the first gas passage is open, the fourth and the fifth gas passages are closed, and the compressor is stopped; a third state in which the first gas passage is closed, the second and said fifth gas passages are open, the third and the fourth gas passages are closed, and the compressor is driven to suck out the pressure medium gas from the first high-pressure vessel and supply a high-pressure pressure medium gas to the second high-pressure vessel; and a fourth state in which the first gas passage is closed, the second and said fifth gas passages are open, the third and the fourth gas passages are closed, and the compressor is driven to suck out the pressure medium gas from the second high-pressure vessel and supply a high-pressure pressure medium gas to the first high-pressure vessel.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">In the above-described hot isostatic pressing method, operation can be made at least in the following procedure: in the first state, a workpiece is heated and pressed in the first high-pressure vessel, and a workpiece is placed in the heated state in the second high-pressure vessel; after termination of heating and pressing the workpiece in the first high-pressure vessel, the internal pressure of the first high-pressure vessel is reduced and at the same time the interior of the second high-pressure vessel is pressed, in the second state, after internal pressure of the first high-pressure vessel and internal pressure of the second high-pressure vessel have assumed a nearly balanced state, the internal pressure of the first high-pressure vessel is further reduced, and at the same time, the interior of the second high-pressure vessel is further pressed, in the third state; in the first state, the workpiece is heated and pressed in said second high-pressure vessel, and a workpiece is placed in a heated state in the first high-pressure vessel; after termination of heating and pressing the workpieces by said second high-pressure vessel, the internal pressure of the second high-pressure vessel is reduced, and at the same time, the interior of said first high-pressure vessel is pressed, in the second state; and after internal pressure of the first high-pressure vessel and internal pressure of the second high-pressure vessel have assumed a nearly balanced state, the internal pressure of the second high-pressure vessel is further reduced, and at the same time, the interior of the first high-pressure vessel is further pressed, in the fourth state.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">In the hot isostatic pressing apparatus, the first and second high-pressure vessels can be constituted so as to have therein a treatment chamber for heating and pressing a workpiece, a base heater arranged downward of the treatment chamber, and a fan for supplying and stirring the pressure medium gas heated by the base heater into the treatment chamber. Further, in the hot isostatic pressing apparatus, the first and second high-pressure vessels can be constituted so as to provide with a heat insulating structure for covering the lateral circumference and upper portion of the treatment chamber. Further, the heat insulating structure can be constituted to be able to be taken out at least with a workpiece and carried from the interior of the first and second high-pressure vessels.</p>

<p id="P-00045" num="00045">The heat insulating structure <b>14</b> comprises a cylindrical trunk <b>21</b> for covering the lateral circumference of the treatment chamber <b>4</b> and an upper wall <b>22</b> for closing an upper-end opening of the trunk <b>21</b> to cover the above of the treatment chamber <b>4</b>, so that the heat insulating structure <b>14</b> is formed to be opened in lower end thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">The heat insulating structure <b>14</b> is placed and supported on the support bed <b>19</b>, and also covers the support tube <b>24</b>, the base heater <b>12</b> and the fan <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">Further, on the support tube <b>24</b> is supported a tube <b>23</b> opened in top and bottom thereof arranged between the heat insulating structure <b>14</b> and the workpiece <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">Moving the lower lid <b>8</b> up and down, for example, may move the workpiece <b>5</b> and the electric furnace <b>3</b> in and out of the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">The electric furnace <b>3</b> is detachably mounted on the lower lid <b>8</b> so that it is removed from the lower lid <b>8</b> and can be carried integrally with the workpiece <b>5</b>. The workpiece <b>5</b> is preheated, while being received within the electric furnace <b>3</b>, in a preheating station, and the thus preheated workpiece <b>5</b> can be carried, integral with the electric furnace <b>3</b>, to a HIP station in which the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> is installed.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">Further, after the HIP treatment, the workpiece <b>5</b> can be carried, integral with the electric furnace <b>3</b>, to a heat treatment station.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">Alternatively, the heat insulating structure <b>14</b> is made detachable relative to the lower lid <b>8</b> leaving the base heater <b>12</b>, the fan <b>13</b> and the motor <b>16</b> on the lower lid <b>8</b>, and the heat insulating structure <b>14</b> and the workpiece <b>5</b> may be carried separately from the base heater <b>12</b>, the fan <b>13</b>, the motor <b>16</b> and the lower lid <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">In the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> constituted as described above, the pressure medium gas sucked in the fan <b>13</b> from the downward or sideward of the fan <b>13</b> is discharged upward, and the pressure medium gas heated in the space where the base heater <b>12</b> is arranged is made to flow upward forcedly to heat the workpiece <b>5</b> within the treatment chamber <b>4</b> defined by the tube <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">Further, it is constituted so that for example, the pressure medium gas is circulated such that the pressure medium gas flown upward of the treatment chamber <b>4</b> passes through a clearance between the tube <b>23</b> and the upper wall <b>22</b> of the heat insulating structure at the upper end of the treatment chamber <b>4</b>, flows downward of the space externally of the tube <b>23</b>, and arrives at the downward of the fan <b>13</b> from the lower side of the support tube <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">The effect of the stirring/forced convection of the pressure medium gas by the fan <b>13</b> is very effective when the workpiece <b>5</b> is being processed under the high pressure, of course; for the purpose of suppressing the occurrence of temperature distribution due to the total elevation of temperature at the time of rapid pressing (at the time of rapidly pouring the pressure medium gas); and for preventing the temperature-lowering due to the adiabatic expansion at the time of rapid reduction (at the time of rapid discharge of the pressure medium gas).</p>
<p id="P-00055" num="00055">That is, it is necessary for shortening the cycle time of the HIP treatment to shorten the occupying time of the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> of the workpiece <b>5</b>, and in the high efficiency HIP in which one cycle is within one hour, the shortening of pressure elevation/reducing time is important.</p>
<p id="P-00056" num="00056">To this end, it is necessary to pour and discharge the gas at high speeds. However, actually, at the time of high-speed pouring, the temperature variation due to the temperature elevation occurs, and at the time of high-speed discharge, the gas within the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> lowers in temperature due to the adiabatic expansion, and therefore, it is difficult to hold temperature where the heat treatment (such as water quench, prescription separating treatment or the like) is jointly carried out immediately after the HIP treatment.</p>
<p id="P-00057" num="00057">To solve the above problem, the workpiece <b>5</b> is heated and pressed within the treatment chamber <b>4</b> while supplying and stirring the heated pressure medium gas into the treatment chamber <b>4</b> by the operation of the fan <b>13</b>. The operation enables suppressing the temperature variation (occurrence of temperature distribution) due to the total elevation of temperature which occurs when the pressure medium gas is poured into the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> at high speeds. Therefore, the pressure elevating time caused by the pressure medium gas within the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> is shortened, and the cycle time of the HIP treatment is shortened.</p>
<p id="P-00058" num="00058">When the pressure medium gas is discharged from the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> after the workpiece <b>5</b> has been heated and pressed, the base heater <b>12</b> and the fan <b>13</b> are operated to thereby prevent the lowering of temperature caused by the adiabatic expansion which occurs where the pressure medium gas within the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> is discharged at high speeds. The operation of the base heater <b>12</b> and the fan <b>13</b> maintains the temperature of the workpiece <b>5</b> at a predetermined temperature, when the heat treatment is carried out continuously after the HIP treatment and the pressure medium gas is discharged from the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b>. Therefore, the reducing time by the pressure medium gas within the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> and the cycle time of the HIP treatment can be shortened.</p>
<p id="P-00059" num="00059">In the above-described constitution, the lower lid <b>8</b> is substantially constituted by one piece, and the base heater <b>12</b> is provided thereon. In heating in an area of temperature below 600&#xb0; C., radiation heat transfer is not much contributed, and therefore, the heat transfer caused by convection of the pressure medium gas will be the main heat transfer. Therefore, the heater <b>12</b> is arranged under the workpiece <b>5</b> to make use of an air current which the pressure medium gas heated by the heater <b>12</b> generates, and the fan <b>13</b> is provided on the lower side of the heater <b>12</b> to generate forced convection to heat and elevate in temperature the workpiece <b>5</b> efficiently.</p>
<p id="P-00060" num="00060">Further, the temperature within the treatment chamber is 600&#xb0; C. at the most. To prevent the excessive rise of temperature in the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> caused by the heat transferred to the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b>, the heat insulating structure <b>14</b> comprising a combination of inner and outer walls in the shape of a reversed tumbler made of metal and an heat insulating material of a ceramic blanket filled between the inner and outer walls will suffice.</p>
<p id="P-00061" num="00061">As described above, as compared to the furnace of the conventional HIP apparatus, the construction is extremely simplified, and not only the cost of the furnace itself is reduced but since one set of heating power supplies will suffice, the structure of the entire apparatus is also simplified.</p>
<p id="P-00062" num="00062">As to the heat insulating performance of the aforementioned heat insulating structure <b>14</b>, heat loss in the vicinity of atmospheric pressure is {fraction (1/10)} to &#x215b; of that at the time of high pressure of nitrogen gas 100 MPa. If the quantity of the workpieces <b>5</b> is sufficient under the atmospheric pressure, even if leaving for 30 minutes, the lowering of temperature is less than 10&#xb0; C. The heat insulating performance of the aforementioned heat insulating structure <b>14</b> is very effective in the case where the temperature is desired to be held in the vicinity of the temperature of the HIP treatment at the time of preheating or after the HIP treatment.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the interior of one HIP apparatus main body out of two HIP apparatus main bodies VSL<b>1</b> and VSL<b>2</b> is pressed, the internal pressure of the other HIP apparatus main body is reduced. Such combination of cycles shortens the pressure elevating time and the reducing time.</p>
<p id="P-00065" num="00065">For example, suppose that the cycle time of one HIP apparatus main body VSL<b>1</b>, VSL<b>2</b> is one hour, HIP treatment is carried out once 30 minutes, and the productivity is improved twice. In such a treatment in a short period of time, the time required to heat and elevate in temperature the workpiece <b>5</b> to a predetermined temperature also poses a problem, and therefore, the workpiece <b>5</b> is heated in advance, and the interior of the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> is always placed in a state heated in the vicinity of the temperature of the HIP treatment.</p>

<p id="P-00076" num="00076">In the following description, with respect to the HIP apparatus main body and the valves, their names are omitted, and a description will be made by way of the above-described reference numerals or symbols.</p>
<p id="P-00077" num="00077">In the initial state, the workpiece <b>5</b> preheated by the preheating station is carried and inserted into the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> of VSL<b>1</b>, and in VSL<b>2</b>, the workpiece <b>5</b> is heated and pressed (in the state of holding temperature and pressure).</p>
<p id="P-00078" num="00078">MSV<b>1</b>, SV<b>1</b> to <b>10</b> are closed, and the compressor <b>28</b> and the vacuum pump <b>29</b> are not operated.</p>
<p id="P-00079" num="00079">In this state, the workpiece <b>5</b> is inserted into VSL<b>1</b>, SV<b>1</b> and SV<b>9</b> are opened, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the interior of the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> of VSL<b>1</b> is subjected to vacuum drawing by the vacuum pump <b>29</b> (the vacuum drawing can be omitted as the case may be). After the vacuum drawing, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, SV<b>1</b> and SV<b>9</b> are closed, MSV<b>1</b>, SV<b>10</b> and SV<b>3</b> are opened, the gas for gas exchange is filled at low pressure into VSLI from the gas cylinder <b>27</b>, and immediately thereafter, SV<b>7</b> is opened as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to release air-mixed gas to the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="P-00080" num="00080">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, MSV<b>1</b>, SV<b>10</b>, and SV<b>3</b> are opened, and other valves are closed to fill the pressure medium gas in VSL<b>1</b> from the gas cylinder <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00081" num="00081">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, MSV<b>1</b>, SV<b>10</b> and SV<b>3</b> are closed, SV<b>1</b> and SV<b>2</b> are opened to communicate VSL<b>1</b> with VSL<b>2</b>, and the gas is filled in differential pressure into VSL<b>1</b> from VSL<b>2</b> already subjected to HIP treatment.</p>
<p id="P-00082" num="00082">Thereafter, when pressures (both the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b>) of VSL<b>1</b> and VSL<b>2</b> are nearly balanced and the elevating speed of pressure in VSL<b>1</b> is lowered, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, SV<b>2</b> is closed, SV<b>4</b> and SV<b>6</b> are opened, and the compressor <b>28</b> is driven to suck out the pressure medium gas from VSL<b>2</b> and press to fill the pressure medium gas in VSL<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00083" num="00083">Then, when pressure in VSL<b>1</b> assumes a predetermined pressure, the operation of the compressor <b>28</b> stops.</p>
<p id="P-00084" num="00084">At that time, the internal pressure of the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> of VSL<b>2</b> is equal to or less than the pressure of the gas cylinder <b>27</b>, and therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, SV<b>1</b>, SV<b>4</b> and SV<b>6</b> are closed, and SV<b>8</b> is opened to release the residual gas in VSL<b>2</b> to the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="P-00085" num="00085">At that time, VSL<b>1</b> is in the state of holding high temperature and high pressure, that is, in the state that the HIP treatment is carried out.</p>
<p id="P-00086" num="00086">On the other hand, with respect to VSL<b>2</b>, the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> is opened at high temperature and the workpiece <b>5</b> therein is taken out in a high temperature state, and as the preparation for succeeding treatment, the workpiece <b>5</b> held at a high temperature is inserted.</p>
<p id="P-00087" num="00087">Then, after the holding high temperature and high pressure (HIP treatment) in VSL<b>1</b>, the above-described procedure is sequentially progressed with respect to VSL<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00088" num="00088">In this manner, the pressure cycles of two HIP apparatus main bodies VSL<b>1</b>, VSL<b>2</b> are adapted to thereby enable operation which is optimized in terms of time as well as energy.</p>
<p id="P-00089" num="00089">In filling in differential pressure the pressure medium gas from the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> of one HIP apparatus main body VSL<b>1</b>, VSL<b>2</b> to the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> of the other HIP apparatus main body VSL<b>1</b>, VSL<b>2</b>, the temperature in the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> on the supply side is held at high temperature in the present invention in order to avoid a problem that the pressure medium gas in the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> on the supply side becomes lowered in temperature due to the adiabatic expansion to lower the temperature substantially.</p>
<p id="P-00090" num="00090">More specifically, the base heater <b>12</b> within the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> on the supply side is energized to heat the pressure medium gas within the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> to a holding temperature or that in the vicinity thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00091" num="00091">It is suggested that since at that time, the workpiece <b>5</b> be encased, the fan <b>13</b> is driven to prevent the occurrence of temperature distribution.</p>
<p id="P-00092" num="00092">Further, within the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> on the side in which the pressure medium gas is supplied, the pressure medium gas having passed through the piping route at high speeds loses speed energy at an impinging portion within the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> (normally, an upper end within the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b>) and at the same time, generates heat (conversion of kinetic energy to heat energy) so that the temperature elevates.</p>
<p id="P-00093" num="00093">It has been experienced that the temperature elevation reaches by 100 to 200&#xb0; C. as the case may be, and to prevent that it is suggested that the fan <b>13</b> within the high-pressure vessel <b>2</b> on the side in which the pressure medium gas is supplied is driven to provide a uniform temperature in the space in the treatment chamber <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00094" num="00094">In the normal HIP treatment, since argon rarely has a problem on reaction with the workpiece <b>5</b> or the like, argon is used as the pressure medium gas. However, in a metal material which is a main object of the present invention such as Al alloy, since reaction with nitrogen rarely occurs in a temperature region of the HIP treatment described above, it is suggested that nitrogen be used.</p>
<p id="P-00095" num="00095">That is, since the compressive property of nitrogen are small by 5 to 10% as compared with argon, the gas quantity of nitrogen necessary for being pressed to the same pressure as that used normally in the case of argon will suffice to be less, and the effect of shortening pressing time can be expected.</p>
<p id="P-00096" num="00096">Further, nitrogen gas is cheaper than argon gas, which also meets the original object of the present invention, i.e. reduction of the HIP treatment cost.</p>
<p id="P-00097" num="00097">According to the aforementioned present invention, the HIP treatment of the products which can be carried under the atmospheric pressure at high temperature and which are below 600&#xb0; C. in HIP treatment temperature such as Al cast articles and Mg cast articles can be carried out with high efficiency, for example, not less than two cycles per hour.</p>
<p id="P-00098" num="00098">By the reduction of apparatus costs caused by higher efficiency according to the present invention and simplification of the HIP apparatus <b>1</b> in the present invention, the HIP treatment cost can be reduced to {fraction (1/10)} or below of the conventional HIP treatment, and it is possible to apply the invention to Al cast parts of automobiles to which application of conventional HIP treatment has been difficult from a viewpoint of restrictions in terms of treatment costs.</p>
<p id="P-00099" num="00099">The improvement in fatigue strength and ductility (stretching and drawing) by the HIP treatment itself enables thinner parts easily in terms of designing parts. Lighter weight of automobiles and energy-saving effect associated therewith, and effect of reduction in exhaust gases can be also expected, greatly contributing to the development of automobile industries or the like in future.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1132" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">This invention relates to a directly-driven power swing rod device without dead points, particularly to one able to be driven by a tremendous power and applicable to a high-speed and heavy-load response system, improving a conventional table PC swing rod which is unable to bear being driven by a huge power and easy to crack, and has not sufficient mechanical strength.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">Conventional PC table swing rod devices include three categories: a friction-spherical shape, a cross shape and a double-<?img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="3.13mm" wi="2.79mm" file="US06837124-20050104-P00900.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif" ?> shape.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">The friction-spherical-shaped swing rod device is provided with a control rod having a frictional sphere at the bottom end and started by friction, liable to slip and slow down in response in case a frictional force is not large enough.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">The cross-shaped swing rod device is designed according to a mechanical structure, therefore its structure has to be thickened and reinforced in order to prevent the device from cracking in case of driving a huge power, cumbersome in handling, having a large frictional force and slow in response.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">The double <?img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" he="3.13mm" wi="2.79mm" file="US06837124-20050104-P00900.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif" ?>-shaped swing rod device lacks powerful mechanical members to support the device so an excessively large mechanical force cannot be applied to the device, otherwise it may give rise to an eccentric condition, gear slipping and even cracking of the device.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">In view of the drawbacks of the conventional swing rod devices mentioned above, the newly designed power swing rod device without dead points in the present invention is far better than a conventional one which has dead points and is liable to become unstable and deadlocked, and even may result in cracking.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1171" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The objective of the invention is to offer a directly-driven power swing rod device without dead points, able to be driven by a huge power and applicable to a high-speed and heavy-load response system, capable of improving the defects of the conventional swing rod device which is unable to bear being driven by a tremendous power and easy to crack, and has not enough mechanical strength but an excessively large frictional force.</p>

<p id="P-00029" num="00029">The first and the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B are respectively formed with a lateral wall <b>20</b>A, <b>21</b>B and a vertical wall <b>21</b>A, <b>20</b>B perpendicular to each other. The two L-shaped frames <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B are arranged together to define a square opening for the rod base <b>10</b> of the control rod <b>1</b> to be positioned therein, as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. The first L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A is provided on the lateral wall <b>20</b>A with a hole base <b>200</b>A conforming to the guide hole <b>111</b> of the rod base <b>10</b> and fixed in the interior with a bearing <b>201</b>A having a bearing hole <b>2010</b>A matching with the guide hole <b>11</b> of the rod base <b>10</b>.

<p id="P-00030" num="00030">The two motor fixing frames <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B are respectively disposed on the outer sides of the vertical wall <b>21</b>A of the first L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A and the lateral wall <b>21</b>B of the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and have their bottom sides disposed on a fixing plate <b>6</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. The two motor fixing frames <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B are respectively bored with a through hole <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B in the center of the vertical wall respectively facing the vertical wall <b>21</b>A of the first L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A and the lateral wall <b>21</b>B of the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>B.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">The two motors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> are respectively installed on the two motor fixing frames <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and have their shafts M<b>10</b>, M<b>20</b> respectively extending out of the two through holes <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B and getting into a contained angles of the two motor fixing frames <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B. The two shafts M<b>10</b>, M<b>20</b> of the two motors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> are respectively formed with a projection M<b>11</b>, M<b>21</b> on the side wall of an end, respectively having a female threaded hole M<b>110</b>, M<b>210</b> for bolts M<b>11</b>, M<b>211</b> to be respectively screwed therein, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">Further, the vertical wall <b>21</b>A of the first L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A and the lateral wall <b>21</b>B of the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>B are respectively bored with an accommodating hole <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B for respectively receiving and positioning the two shafts M<b>10</b>, M<b>20</b> of the two motors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>. Thus, when the motor M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> is started to rotate its shaft M<b>10</b>, M<b>20</b> for an angle (The rotation of the shaft M<b>10</b>, M<b>20</b> can be set within a shifting angle only), the L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B will synchronously be driven to shift for an angle. In addition, the two motors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> are respectively provided with a position detecting coder which is able to detect a coordinate message and correctly and quickly transmit it to a control device (a microcomputer IC for instance) to precisely control the motor M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> to operate and actuate the shaft M<b>10</b>, M<b>20</b> to rotate for a certain angle (or keep immovable).</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">A first interacting member <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>5</b>, is inserted through the accommodating hole <b>22</b>B of the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>B and the guide hole <b>11</b> of the rod base <b>10</b> and extends out of the bearing hole <b>2010</b>A in the lateral wall <b>20</b>A of the first L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A. The end of the first interacting member <b>4</b> extending out of the lateral wall <b>20</b>A of the first L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A is formed with a threaded surface <b>40</b> for a nut <b>41</b> to engage with. The guide hole <b>11</b> of the rod base <b>10</b> is capsule-shaped, that is, the upper and lower inner wall of the guide hole <b>11</b> are right surfaces and the opposite ends are arc-shaped, forming an inner wide space inside for the first interacting member <b>4</b> to shift a little therein. The first interacting member <b>4</b> is bored with a vertical through hole <b>42</b> at the portion positioned in the guide hole <b>11</b> of the rod base <b>10</b> to match with the vertical hole <b>12</b> of the rod base <b>10</b> so that a bolt <b>43</b> can be inserted from under the center hole <b>12</b> and passing through the center hole <b>12</b> of the rod base <b>10</b> as well as the through hole <b>42</b> of the first interacting member <b>4</b> and finally is screwed with the threaded hole <b>120</b> in the rod base <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>. Thus, the control rod <b>1</b> has one lower side supported by the first L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A with the center point of the coordinate rod base <b>10</b> kept immovable by the bolt <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">The second interacting member <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, has a threaded end <b>50</b> to engage with a threaded positioning, hole <b>13</b> in one side of the coordinate rod base <b>10</b> of the control rod I, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and the other end formed with a shaft <b>51</b> to be fitted in the bearing hole <b>2010</b>B in the vertical wall <b>20</b>B of the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>B to let the coordinate rod base <b>10</b> of the control rod <b>1</b> supported by the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>B.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">The protective frame <b>7</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, partitions off and shields the first and the second L-shaped frames <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and the rod base <b>10</b> of the control rod <b>1</b>, having a round position-limiting opening <b>70</b> at the topside for the upper portion of the control rod <b>1</b> to extend up therethrough and be limited in the shifting angles of the control rod <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">After the device of the invention is assembled, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, and when the control rod <b>1</b> is moved to produced effection, the position detecting coder of the motor M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> will detect a coordinate message and correctly and immediately transmit it to a control device (a microcomputer control IC for example) which will precisely control the motor M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> to operate and drive the shaft M<b>10</b>, M<b>20</b> to rotate for an angle (or keep immovable) together with the first and the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B so as to supply the control rod <b>1</b> with an auxiliary power, enabling a user to handle the control rod <b>1</b> with less force.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">Modes of controlling and operating the swing rod device of the invention are further described below.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">1. When the control rod <b>1</b> is not moved and keeps its center upright, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, the two L-shaped frames <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B maintain a level position.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">2. In case the control rod <b>1</b> is controlled to deflect in a direction (45&#xb0; to the front left) indicated by the arrow X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 7</figref>, the position detecting coder of the motor M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> will immediately detect the coordinate message and correctly and quickly transmit it to the control device. Synchronously, the control device controls the motor M<b>1</b> to drive the first L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A to move for an angle shown in FIG. <b>6</b>C and also controls the motor M<b>2</b> to move the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>B for an angle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, thus enabling a user to operate the control rod <b>1</b> with less force with the help of the power of the motors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">On the contrary, if the control rod <b>1</b> is moved to deflect in a direction (45&#xb0; to the rear right) indicated by the arrow Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 9</figref>, the position detecting coder will instantly detect the shifting coordinate message and correctly and quickly transmit it to the control device, which will control the motor M<b>1</b> to drive the first L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A to turn for an angle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, and also control the motor M<b>2</b> to drive the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>B to turn for an angle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, permitting a user to operate the control rod <b>1</b> with less force due to the help of the power of the two motors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">3. If the control rod is deflected in the directions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-13</figref>, forming a perpendicular intersecting angle with the first and second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, its different deflecting angles will bring forth different results as described below.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">(1). If the control rod <b>1</b> is longitudinally moved toward the motor M<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, or shifted far away from the motor M<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the control rod <b>1</b> and the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>B are in a perpendicular intersecting condition. Under the circumstances, the second interacting member <b>5</b>, which connects the rod base <b>10</b> of the control rod <b>1</b> with the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>B, will rotate axially at original position only, and the motor M<b>2</b> producing no deflection will not operate, but at this time the motor M<b>1</b> will drive its shaft M<b>10</b> to rotate and control the shift L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A to swing so as to supply the control rod <b>1</b> with an auxiliary power.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">(2). If the control rod <b>1</b> is latitudinally moved toward the motor M<b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, or moved far away from the motor M<b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the first interacting member <b>4</b> connecting the rod base <b>10</b> of the control rod <b>1</b> with the fist L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A will rotate axially at original position only, and the motor M<b>1</b> producing no deflection will not operate, but the motor M<b>2</b> will drive its shaft M<b>20</b> to rotate for an angle and drive the second L-shaped frame <b>2</b>B to swing to supply the control rod <b>1</b> with an auxiliary power.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">As can be understood from the above description, this invention has the following advantages.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">1. When the control rod <b>1</b> is moved for a certain angle, the two motors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> or one of them can be directly driven to operate and drive the L-shaped frame <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B to swing, enabling a user to handle the control rod <b>1</b> with less force, having driving effects of high moment, high speed, sensitive response and no dead points, and able to improve the shortcomings of the conventional swing rod which is unable to bear being driven by a huge power and easy to crack, has insufficient mechanical strength and an excessively large frictional force.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">2. The control rod <b>1</b> of the invention can be freely moved in any direction within regulated strokes, having no dead points, low friction, and able to be operated with high speed, sensitive response and high bandwidth.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">3. The device of this invention is economical in material and low in cost, but it has a tremendous mechanical strength and can sustain a comparatively large load.</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">4. Generally, an orthogonal swing rod device keeps its center immovable so it may produce dead points. The swing rod device of this invention has a capsule-shaped guide hole bored in the bottom rod base of the swing rod and a bolt provided to keep the center of the swing rod stationary, avoiding causing dead points.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">5. The device of this invention can be driven directly by a large power without employing any speed reducing gearing, able to reach a requirement of high-speed response. Besides, bearings are employed in the device for enduring heavy-load driving of the motor, having extremely great mechanical strength to meet rigorous demand of heavy-load and high-speed driving.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">6. The control rod <b>1</b> of this invention can also be applied to the camera of a fixed monitor, as the control rod of a wheelchair and the auxiliary power of a car steering wheel.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been described above, it will be recognized and understood that various modifications may be made therein and the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications that may fall within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e528" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention relates to a cooking device and, more particularly, to a cooking device that is convertible for use as both a rotisserie and a kebab cooking device in a conventional oven.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e538" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">Rotisserie ovens are popular for roasting chickens and the like because the slow, even turning of the chicken results in a tender and juicy bird with a crispy skin on every side. However, rotisserie ovens typically are self-contained such that the oven includes its own heat source and enclosure. Accordingly, these ovens are generally bulky to store and expensive to purchase. For these reasons, rotisserie ovens typically are used only in commercial establishments or as a luxury item in residential households having the needed storage space and income to purchase such one-time use items.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Accordingly, there is a need for a rotisserie cooking device that is easy to store and inexpensive to manufacture. Moreover, there is a need for a rotisserie device that may be used for other cooking functions so that the initial purchase of the device may be justified as a non-luxury cooking item.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e553" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">An object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide a rotisserie cooking device that is easy to store.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">A further object of the present invention is to provide a rotisserie cooking device that is inexpensive to manufacture.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Another object of the present invention is to provide a rotisserie cooking device that may be used for other cooking functions.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The present invention provides a cooking device that is convertible between a rotisserie cooking device and a kebab cooking device, folds up for compact storage, uses the heat element and enclosure of a conventional oven, and is inexpensive to manufacture.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e669" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an isometric view of the cooking device of the present invention in the rotisserie cooking configuration. In particular, cooking device <b>10</b> comprises a first base portion <b>12</b>, a second base portion <b>14</b>, a rotisserie spit or skewer <b>16</b> and a power device <b>18</b>. First base portion <b>12</b> comprises first <b>20</b> and second <b>22</b> legs and a crossbar <b>24</b> extending there between. First leg <b>20</b> and second leg <b>22</b> each including a notch <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> (in this view notch <b>28</b> is hidden by skewer <b>16</b> but the notch is a mirror image of notch <b>26</b> on first leg <b>20</b>), respectively, described in more detail below, for locking the cooking device in the rotisserie configuration, as shown. Crossbar <b>24</b> includes a plurality of recesses <b>30</b> adapted for each receiving a shish kabab skewer (not shown) therein.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">Second base portion <b>14</b> comprises first <b>32</b> and second <b>34</b> legs and a cross bar <b>36</b> extending there between. First leg <b>32</b> and second leg <b>34</b> each include a projection <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> (in this view projection <b>40</b> is hidden by skewer <b>16</b> but the projection is a mirror image of projection <b>38</b> on first leg <b>32</b>), respectively, described in more detail below, for mating with notches <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, respectively, for locking the cooking device in the rotisserie configuration. First and second legs <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> further include recesses <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> (in this view recess <b>44</b> is hidden by skewer <b>16</b> but the recess is a mirror image of recess <b>42</b> on first leg <b>32</b>), respectively, for supporting rotisserie skewer <b>16</b> therein. In this embodiment, recesses <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are the same size. However, in other embodiments, recess <b>42</b> may be smaller in size than recess <b>44</b> such that skewer <b>16</b> may be supported by the recesses in only one orientation such that power device <b>18</b> will contact a sprocket end of skewer <b>16</b>, as will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">Second base portion <b>14</b> further includes a rotisserie bracket <b>46</b> on second leg <b>34</b> and a kebab bracket <b>48</b> on first leg <b>32</b>, each for supporting a worm gear <b>50</b>. In the configuration shown, worm gear <b>50</b> is positioned within rotisserie bracket <b>46</b> and kebab bracket <b>48</b> remains empty. Cross bar <b>36</b> of second base portion <b>14</b> includes a plurality of recesses <b>52</b>, a sprocket <b>54</b> and a movable kebab plate gear <b>56</b>, as will be described in more detail below. Kebab plate gear <b>56</b> is secured to crossbar <b>36</b> by fasteners <b>58</b> received within slots <b>60</b> of the gear plate such that the kebab gear plate <b>56</b> is movable along axis <b>62</b> with respect to crossbar <b>36</b>. Sprocket <b>54</b> is secured to crossbar <b>36</b> so that the sprocket may rotate on crossbar <b>36</b> in directions <b>64</b>. In the embodiment shown, recesses <b>30</b> of first base portion <b>12</b> are smaller in size than recesses <b>52</b> of second base portion <b>14</b> such that kebab skewers (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) may be supported by the recesses in only one orientation, as will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">Power device <b>18</b> typically includes a motor <b>66</b> connected to a shaft <b>68</b>, such as a cable, which is in turn connected to worm gear <b>50</b>. Shaft <b>68</b> typically comprises a flexible, heat resistant cable such that the cable may be threaded through the slightly open door of a conventional oven or barbecue during cooking. Activation of motor <b>66</b> will rotate worm gear <b>50</b> about its axis <b>70</b> in a direction <b>72</b>, which may be accomplished by any means known to those skilled in the art. Power device <b>18</b> may be battery operated, as shown, or may include a power cable (not shown) for connecting motor <b>66</b> to a standard plug-in power receptacle, such as a 110 volt duplex outlet (not shown). Cable <b>68</b> may be of any length as is desired, but typically will have a length sufficient such that base portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, and skewer <b>16</b>, can be placed within the heated enclosure of a conventional oven with the cable extending out of the oven enclosure, or a barbecue enclosure, through the slightly ajar oven door (not shown). Those skilled in art will understand that during use of the rotisserie cooking device, the conventional oven heating element will typically will be set to &#x201c;broil&#x201d; and the door to the conventional oven enclosure may be purposefully left ajar for circulation reasons such that passage of the motor cable of the present invention through the slightly ajar door does not interfere with such rotisserie cooking. In this manner, motor <b>66</b> can be placed on top of the oven, outside of the heated enclosure of the oven, while allowing food placed on the skewers to be heated by the oven. Accordingly, cooking device <b>20</b> allows one to use the heating element and the large enclosure of a convention oven such that cooking device <b>20</b> may be manufactured in a compact size, and at a relatively inexpensive cost.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">In this rotisserie cooking configuration, rotisserie spit <b>16</b> is supported above crossbars <b>24</b> and <b>36</b> at a height <b>74</b> such that there is sufficient room for turning of a chicken on spit <b>16</b> without the chicken contacting the crossbars <b>24</b> or <b>36</b>, or the flat surface on which the crossbars are supported.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a second isometric view of the cooking device of FIG. <b>1</b>. Spit <b>16</b> includes an elongate central skewer <b>80</b> and four shorter outer skewers <b>82</b>. A first end <b>84</b> of central skewer <b>80</b> is received within recess <b>42</b> of leg <b>32</b> of second base portion <b>14</b> and a second end <b>86</b> of central skewer <b>80</b> is received within recess <b>44</b> of leg <b>34</b> of second base portion <b>14</b>. In this configuration, a sprocket <b>88</b> of skewer <b>16</b> mates with worm gear <b>50</b> retained within bracket <b>46</b> such that rotation of worm gear <b>50</b> in direction <b>72</b> will result in rotation of sprocket <b>88</b> about its central axis <b>90</b> in a direction <b>92</b> (more clearly shown in FIG. <b>1</b>). Skewers <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> are secured to sprocket <b>88</b> such that rotation of sprocket <b>88</b> in direction <b>92</b> will result in rotation of skewers <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> in direction <b>92</b>. Accordingly, a chicken or other roasting food secured to central skewer <b>80</b> and outer skewers <b>82</b> will rotate in direction <b>92</b> about central axis <b>90</b> of spit <b>16</b>. In this manner, the food secured to spit <b>16</b> will be evenly roasted within the heated enclosure of a conventional oven.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a detailed view of the rotisserie locking device of FIG. <b>1</b>. Locking device <b>94</b> comprises notch <b>26</b> of first leg <b>20</b> of first base portion <b>12</b> and projection <b>38</b> of first leg <b>32</b> of second base portion <b>14</b>. First leg <b>20</b> is secured to first leg <b>32</b> by a fastener <b>96</b> such that legs <b>20</b> and <b>32</b> may pivot about fastener <b>96</b>. When the cooking device is placed on a flat surface (not shown), the weight of gravity will tend to force first leg <b>20</b> to rotate in direction <b>98</b> and will tend to force first leg <b>32</b> to rotate in direction <b>100</b>. In this manner, projection <b>38</b> is secured with notch <b>26</b>, thereby stabilizing the cooking device. Second leg <b>22</b> and second leg <b>34</b> are connected to one another in a mirror image manner to that shown in the detail view of FIG. <b>3</b>. Accordingly, the cooking device is stable in the rotisserie configuration, as shown, by projections <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> which are received within notches <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, respectively. To collapse or fold the cooking device, the cooking device is lifted from the flat surface on which it rests, such that leg <b>20</b> may be moved in direction <b>100</b> about fastener <b>96</b> and leg <b>32</b> may be moved in direction <b>98</b> about fastener <b>96</b>, as will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a detailed view of the rotisserie turning device. In particular, sprocket <b>88</b> is shown having teeth <b>102</b> that mate with raised helical projections <b>104</b> of worm gear <b>50</b>. Bracket <b>46</b> includes a first aperture <b>106</b> and a second aperture <b>108</b>, wherein second aperture <b>108</b> typically is smaller than first aperture <b>106</b>. Worm gear <b>50</b> typically includes a first end <b>110</b> region having a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of helical projections <b>104</b>. Accordingly, worm gear <b>50</b> is secured within bracket <b>46</b> wherein first end <b>110</b> is received within second aperture <b>108</b> and a second end region <b>112</b>, having a diameter similar to that of raised helical projections <b>104</b>, is received within first aperture <b>106</b> of bracket <b>46</b>. The worm gear is rotationally secured within bracket <b>46</b> such that worm gear <b>50</b> may be rotated in direction <b>72</b> about its axis <b>70</b> by motor <b>66</b> (shown in FIG. <b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> an isometric view of the cooking device of the present invention in the kebab cooking configuration. In this configuration, first base portion <b>12</b> and second base portion <b>14</b> have been rotated about fasteners <b>96</b> such that the base portions extend away from one another and lie in the same plane. Accordingly, cooking device <b>20</b> may be placed on a flat surface wherein the flat surface supports the cooking device in this flat, kebab cooking configuration. In this kebab cooking configuration, rotisserie spit <b>16</b> has been removed and kebab skewers <b>114</b> have been placed in corresponding sets of recesses <b>30</b> on crossbar portion <b>24</b>, and recesses <b>52</b> on crossbar portion <b>36</b>. Each of kebab skewers <b>114</b> include a first end region <b>116</b> having a diameter sized to be received within an aperture <b>30</b> of first base portion <b>12</b> and a second end region <b>118</b> having a diameter slightly larger than first end region <b>116</b>, and sized to be received within an aperture <b>52</b> of second base portion <b>14</b>. In this manner, a sprocket portion <b>120</b> of each kebab skewer <b>114</b> will be positioned in contact with the teeth <b>122</b> of kebab plate gear <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">In the kebab cooking configuration, worm gear <b>50</b> is removed from rotisserie bracket <b>46</b> and is placed in kebab bracket <b>48</b>. Bracket <b>48</b> includes first and second apertures <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, similar in diameter to the apertures of bracket <b>46</b> such that worm gear <b>50</b> is secured within bracket <b>48</b> in the same manner that the worm gear is secured within bracket <b>46</b>. When positioned within bracket <b>46</b>, worm gear <b>50</b> mates with sprocket <b>54</b> which in turn is operatively connected to kebab plate gear <b>56</b> by a pin <b>124</b> that is received within a slot <b>126</b> of plate gear <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">In this kebab cooking configuration, kebab skewers <b>114</b> are supported on crossbars <b>24</b> and <b>36</b> at a height <b>76</b> above the surface that supports the crossbars <b>24</b> and <b>36</b>. Height <b>76</b> of kebab skewers <b>114</b> above the support surface is much less than height <b>74</b> of rotisserie spit <b>16</b> in the rotisserie configuration of the cooking device (shown in FIG. <b>1</b>). However, small pieces of meat and/or vegetables typically are cooked on shish kebab skewers <b>114</b> such that height <b>76</b> is sufficient for turning of the small pieces of meat and/or vegetables without the meat for vegetables contacting the support surface. In the embodiment shown, height <b>74</b> typically is approximately 6.0 inches whereas height <b>76</b> is approximately 1.5 inches. Accordingly, height <b>74</b> typically is approximately five times greater than height <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is top view of the cooking device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, showing worm gear <b>50</b> in contact with sprocket <b>54</b> and five kebab skewers <b>114</b> positioned on base portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Each of the five kebab skewers <b>114</b> includes a sprocket portion <b>120</b> in contact with the teeth <b>122</b> of plate gear <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a detailed view of the kebab turning device. In particular, raised helical projections <b>104</b> of worm gear <b>50</b> are positioned within bracket <b>48</b> such that the projections <b>104</b> contact the teeth <b>128</b> of sprocket <b>54</b>. Motor <b>66</b> causes worm gear <b>50</b> to rotate in direction <b>72</b> about its axis <b>70</b> such that raised projections <b>104</b> cause sprocket <b>54</b> to turn about fastener <b>130</b> in direction <b>64</b>, wherein fastener <b>130</b> secures the sprocket <b>54</b> to second base portion <b>14</b>. Rotation of sprocket <b>54</b> in direction <b>64</b> will cause pin <b>124</b>, secured to sprocket <b>54</b>, to also rotate in direction <b>64</b>. Rotation of pin <b>124</b> in direction <b>64</b>, by the positioning of pin <b>124</b> within slot <b>126</b>, will cause kebab plate gear to move in direction <b>62</b>. Accordingly, activation of motor <b>66</b> will cause the plate gear to move in direction <b>62</b> which, due to the mating connection of teeth <b>122</b> of plate gear <b>56</b> and sprocket <b>120</b> of skewers <b>114</b>, will cause skewers <b>114</b> to rotate in a direction <b>132</b>. Those skilled in the art will understand that sprocket <b>54</b> may rotate counter-clockwise, or clockwise, and still result in movement of plate gear <b>56</b> in direction <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">Due to the similar configuration of rotisserie bracket <b>46</b> and kebab bracket <b>48</b>, a single worm gear <b>50</b> and a single motor <b>66</b> may be used interchangeably within the two brackets to rotate either rotisserie spit <b>16</b> or the set of kebab skewers <b>114</b>. This versatility of cooking device <b>20</b> allows multiple functions of the device while retaining the cost of the device in a price range that is reasonable for many consumers. Accordingly, the device is multi-functional, i.e., the device may be used as a rotisserie cooker or a kebab cooker, wherein the motor, placed outside the heated enclosure of a conventional oven, rotates the skewers for even cooking.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an isometric view of the cooking device folded for storage. In this folded configuration first base portion <b>12</b> fits adjacent to and interior of second base portion <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the device folds into a compact space occupying approximately half the space required for the kebab configuration shown in FIG. <b>6</b>. In this folded configuration, the cooking device <b>20</b> may easily be placed within a kitchen drawer for storage when not in use. The cooking device of the present invention, therefore, requires much less space to store than a rotisserie device that includes its own heating element and its own enclosure for surrounding the food being cooked. Due to the small size of the device and the lack of any electronic parts (when motor <b>66</b> is removed from connection to the base portions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>) the base portions of the cooking device may be washed in a conventional dishwasher. Moreover, due to the relatively small amount of material used to fabricate the cooking device, typically a heat resistant metal such as iron or steel which may be nickel or chrome coated for a shiny appearance, the cooking device can be fabricated at a relatively inexpensive cost.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">In the above description numerous details have been set forth in order to provide a more through understanding of the present invention. It will be obvious, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced using other equivalent designs.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e740" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention relates to a valve control system for an internal combustion engine, and more particularly, to such a system which can vary the operational characteristics of an engine poppet valve, in accordance with various operational modes of the engine.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">Variable valve control systems for engine poppet valves are already generally well known in the art. Although such variable valve control systems can be applied to either the intake poppet valve, or the exhaust poppet valve, or both, it is most common to utilize such a variable valve control system to vary the &#x201c;lift&#x201d; (the amount of opening of the engine poppet valve) of only the intake poppet valves, and the invention will be described in connection with such an arrangement.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">A &#x201c;dual lift&#x201d; valve control system is known from U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,762,096 and 5,660,153, both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. In a typical dual lift valve control system, there is a low lift condition in which the poppet valve opens a relatively small amount while the engine is operating at relatively lower speeds, and a high lift condition in which the poppet valve opens a relatively large amount while the engine is operating at relatively higher speeds. Normally, such dual lift valve control systems require some sort of actuator (typically an electromagnetic or electro-hydraulic actuator) to move a latch member between unlatched (low lift) and latched (high lift) conditions. Although such dual lift valve control systems have shown the ability to perform in a generally satisfactory manner, there are many vehicle applications in which it is desirable to be able to select from among a greater range of lift options than merely &#x201c;high&#x201d; lift and &#x201c;low&#x201d; lift.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Also now well know to those skilled in the art are valve control systems of the type including &#x201c;valve deactivation&#x201d; capability. One embodiment of a valve deactivation control system is illustrated and described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,321,704, also assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. In the valve deactivation system of the cited patent, there is an hydraulic lash adjuster (HLA) which may be operated in either: (i) a latched condition, in which case the rotation of the camshaft will result in normal valve lift, or (ii) an unlatched condition, introducing lost motion into the valve gear train, whereby rotation of the camshaft will result in very little lift, or more commonly, no lift at all of the engine poppet valve. Such valve deactivation systems have now started to enjoy a certain amount of commercial success, although the required latching mechanism, and the associated controls, add substantially to the cost of the engine valve train, especially considering that the result is merely a choice between normal lift and valve deactivation.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">As is well know to those skilled in the art, in a typical dual lift valve control system, the dual lift capability would be provided for each and every cylinder. For example, on a V-8 engine, all eight of the intake poppet valves (assuming one intake valve per cylinder) would be provided with a dual lift valve control system, and normally, all of the intake poppet valves would operate &#x201c;together&#x201d;, i.e., all would be in the low lift mode or all would be in the high lift mode, at any given point in time.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">On the other hand, on engines having valve deactivation capability (also referred to as &#x201c;cylinder deactivation&#x201d;), only a portion of the cylinders are deactivated. For example, on a V-8 engine, it would be typical to provide the intake poppet valves, and the exhaust poppet valves, for two of the cylinders on each bank with valve deactivation capability so that, as the engine speed and load reach predetermined values, all of the valves for those two cylinders of each bank would be deactivated, such that the engine then operates on four cylinders (i.e., as a &#x201c;V-4&#x201d; engine) at highway speeds and low throttle loads.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">On certain vehicle engines, it would be desirable to provide both dual lift and valve deactivation capability. Unfortunately, based upon the known prior art, to provide even half of the engine poppet valves with both dual lift and valve deactivation capability would result in a valve control system which would be prohibitively expensive, and in many engine applications, would provide substantial packaging problems. The above disadvantage of the prior art is even more of a problem if, instead of &#x201c;cylinder deactivation&#x201d;, it is desired to provide true &#x201c;valve deactivation&#x201d;, and it will be understood that references hereinafter to &#x201c;deactivation&#x201d; will mean and include both cylinder-type and valve-type deactivation. In a true valve deactivation system, there would be two intake poppet valves per cylinder, and deactivation would be provided for one (typically, the &#x201c;tumble&#x201d; intake valve) of the two intake valves on each cylinder. Thus, the problems noted above regarding cost and packaging would be exacerbated by requiring deactivation capability on all eight cylinders.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e780" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved valve control system for an internal combustion engine having both dual lift capability and valve (or cylinder) deactivation capability.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">It is a more specific object of the present invention to provide such an improved valve control system which achieves the above-stated object in a manner which is economically feasible and at the same time is feasible in terms of the overall packaging of the valve control system.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a valve control system which achieves the above-stated objects, but which does not require a separate actuator for each cylinder, or for each poppet valve being controlled, and which is able to use the same structure to achieve both the dual lift and the deactivation.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">The above and other objects of the invention are accomplished by the provision of an improved valve control system for an internal combustion engine including a cylinder head and a poppet valve moveable relative to the cylinder head between open and closed positions. A camshaft has a first cam lobe profile and a second cam lobe profile formed thereon. The valve control system comprises a rocker arm assembly including a first cam follower engageable with the first cam lobe profile and a second cam follower engageable with the second cam lobe profile. The rocker arm assembly defines a valve pad in engagement with a stem tip portion of the poppet valve, and disposed toward a first axial end of the rocker arm assembly, and further defines a first fulcrum surface toward a second axial end of the rocker arm assembly, the first and second axial ends being oppositely disposed about the first and second cam followers. A first lash compensation device is operably associated with the cylinder head and includes a first plunger in engagement with the first fulcrum surface of the rocker arm assembly.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">The improved valve control system is characterized by the rocker arm assembly defining a second fulcrum surface disposed axially between the first fulcrum surface and the cam followers. A second lash compensation device is operably associated with the cylinder head and includes a second plunger in engagement with the second fulcrum surface of the rocker arm assembly. Each of the first and second lash compensation devices is selectively switchable between a latched condition and an unlatched condition.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e964" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">Referring now to the drawings, which are not intended to limit the invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates, somewhat schematically, a portion of a cylinder head <b>11</b> of an internal combustion engine of the overhead cam (OHC) type which incorporates the valve control system of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the valve control system is generally designated <b>13</b>, and is utilized to control the movement (&#x201c;lift&#x201d;) of an engine poppet valve <b>15</b>. As was mentioned in the BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE, the valve control system <b>13</b> of the present invention would typically be used to control and vary the lift of an intake poppet valve, rather than an exhaust poppet valve. The engine poppet valve <b>15</b> includes a tip portion <b>17</b> surrounded by a spring retainer <b>19</b> which, as is well know to those skilled in the art, serves as the seat for the upper end of a valve return spring <b>20</b> (shown only fragmentarily herein).</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">The valve control system <b>13</b> operates in conjunction with a camshaft, generally designated <b>21</b>, to provide cyclical opening motion to the engine poppet valve <b>15</b>, in opposition to the biasing force of the valve return spring <b>20</b>. The camshaft <b>21</b> includes a base circle portion <b>23</b>, a first, low lift cam profile <b>25</b> and a second, high lift cam profile <b>27</b>. As will be understood from the subsequent description of the invention, typically there would be one of the high lift cam profiles <b>27</b> and a pair of low lift cam profiles <b>25</b>, disposed on axially opposite sides of the high lift cam profile <b>27</b>. For purposes of the subsequent description, it will be assumed that the camshaft <b>21</b> is rotating counter-clockwise, as is shown by the arrow in FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The valve control system <b>13</b> of the present invention comprises two primary &#x201c;subsystems&#x201d;, a rocker arm assembly, generally designated <b>29</b>, and a hydraulic lash adjuster assembly, generally designated <b>31</b>. Each of the assemblies <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> will now be described in greater detail. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the particular construction, shown and described hereinafter, of the rocker arm assembly <b>29</b>, and of the HLA assembly <b>31</b> is by way of example only, and is not essential to the present invention, except as is specifically recited in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">Referring now primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the rocker arm assembly <b>29</b> comprises an outer rocker arm subassembly, generally designated <b>33</b>. The subassembly <b>33</b> includes an inner body member <b>35</b> and an outer body member <b>37</b>. Each of the body members <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> is in the form of a downwardly-opening, generally U-shaped channel member. A first end of the rocker arm assembly <b>29</b> is disposed adjacent the poppet valve <b>15</b>. At a second, axially opposite end (left end in FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>), the inner and outer body members <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> are joined together by a socket member <b>39</b> which includes a rivet portion <b>41</b>. Toward the first end (right end in FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>), the body members <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> define aligned circular openings <b>43</b>. Disposed within the openings <b>43</b> is a triangular &#x201c;elephant's foot&#x201d; member <b>45</b> (see FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>), the function of which is to ensure that for any orientation of the rocker arm assembly <b>29</b>, there is face-to-face engagement between a top surface of the tip portion <b>17</b> of the poppet valve <b>15</b> and a surface of the elephant's foot member <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">The outer body member <b>37</b> includes a pair of pocket portions <b>47</b> which are deformed laterally outward, out of the plane of the rest of the outer body member <b>37</b>, and therefore, cooperate with the adjacent outer surface of the inner body member <b>35</b> to define openings or &#x201c;pockets&#x201d;. In each of the pockets formed by the portions <b>47</b>, there is disposed a generally cylindrical cam follower <b>49</b>, each of the cam followers <b>49</b> being disposed for engagement with one of the low lift cam profiles <b>25</b>. Although not shown herein, for simplicity of illustration, those skilled in the art will understand that, preferably, each of the cam followers <b>49</b> would rotate about a shaft, with the opposite ends of each of the shafts being received within mating openings in the adjacent wall portions of the inner body member <b>35</b> and the pocket portion <b>47</b>. Such an arrangement is already well known in the art.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">The inner and outer body members <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> also cooperate to define a pair of aligned circular openings <b>51</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and, upon assembly of the entire rocker arm assembly <b>29</b>, there is disposed within the openings <b>51</b> an axle shaft <b>53</b> (see FIG. <b>2</b>), the function of which will be described subsequently.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">Referring now primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the rocker arm assembly <b>29</b> also includes an inner rocker arm subassembly, generally designated <b>55</b>, which upon assembly of the entire rocker arm assembly <b>29</b>, is disposed between the side walls of the inner body member <b>35</b> in a manner which is generally well known to those skilled in the art. The inner rocker arm subassembly <b>55</b> comprises a generally upwardly opening U-shaped member <b>57</b>, in which the opposite side walls are joined by a bottom portion <b>59</b>, the function of which will be described subsequently. Disposed between the adjacent sidewalls of the member <b>57</b> is a second, generally cylindrical cam follower <b>61</b>, which is disposed to be in engagement with the high lift cam profile <b>27</b>. The cam follower <b>61</b> is rotatably mounted on an axle shaft <b>63</b> which is received within mating openings in the sidewalls of the member <b>57</b>. The sidewalls of the member <b>57</b> also define a pair of aligned circular openings <b>65</b> (see FIG. <b>5</b>), which are substantially the same size as the openings <b>51</b> defined by the outer rocker arm subassembly <b>33</b>, such that the axle shaft <b>53</b> passes through the openings <b>65</b>. Therefore, in the subject embodiment, the inner rocker arm subassembly <b>55</b> is able to pivot, relative to the outer rocker arm subassembly <b>33</b>, about the axis of the axle shaft <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Referring now primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 9</figref>, the HLA assembly <b>31</b> will be described in some detail. The HLA assembly <b>31</b> comprises a housing member <b>71</b> which is received within a mating opening, generally designated <b>72</b> and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the opening <b>72</b> being defined, in the subject embodiment, by the cylinder head <b>11</b>. The housing member <b>71</b> includes a relatively larger cylindrical portion <b>73</b>, received within a cylindrical portion of the opening <b>72</b> in the cylinder head <b>11</b>. Extending downwardly from the cylindrical portion <b>73</b> is a relatively smaller cylindrical portion <b>75</b>, and similarly, extending upwardly from the cylindrical portion <b>73</b> is another smaller cylindrical portion <b>77</b> (see also FIG. <b>6</b>). The reason for the vertical &#x201c;offset&#x201d; of the cylindrical portions <b>75</b> and <b>77</b> in opposite directions, relative to main part of the cylindrical portion <b>73</b>, may be better understood by viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and considering the geometry and function of the rocker arm assembly <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">The housing member <b>71</b> is, in the subject embodiment, an investment cast part which is then subsequently machined to the configuration shown. The housing member <b>71</b> defines a first vertical bore <b>79</b> and a second vertical bore <b>81</b>, the bores <b>79</b> and <b>81</b> preferably being parallel and having their center lines defining a plane (the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) which approximately coincides with the longitudinal axis of the rocker arm assembly <b>29</b>. This would be the same plane as is defined by the lines <b>3</b>&#x2014;<b>3</b> or FIG. <b>2</b> and lines <b>5</b>&#x2014;<b>5</b> of FIG. <b>4</b>. It should be understood that the housing member <b>71</b> could be eliminated, as a separate member, and the bores <b>79</b> and <b>81</b>, and the various other recesses and bores required, could simply be machined in the head, but the provision of the separate housing member <b>71</b> is preferred.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">Disposed within the first bore <b>79</b> is a first lash compensation device <b>83</b> (see FIG. <b>8</b>), and disposed within the second bore <b>81</b> is a second lash compensation device <b>85</b> (see FIG. <b>9</b>). The lash compensation devices <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> (each of which is also referred to as a &#x201c;hydraulic lash adjuster&#x201d; or an &#x201c;HLA&#x201d;) may be of the type which are generally well know to those skilled in the art, are nearly identical to each other, and therefore will be described only briefly hereinafter. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the lash compensation devices <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> are functionally important elements of the overall valve control system <b>13</b>, although the particular construction details shown herein are not essential, except as may be noted subsequently.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">Each of the lash compensation devices <b>83</b> and <b>85</b>, in the subject embodiment, and by way of example only, includes a body member <b>87</b> defining an annular groove <b>89</b>. Disposed within the body member <b>87</b> is a lower plunger member <b>91</b> which cooperates with the body member <b>87</b> to define a high pressure chamber <b>93</b>. The lower plunger member <b>91</b> also defines a seat surface for a ball check valve <b>95</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the lash compensation device <b>83</b> includes an upper plunger member <b>97</b> which comprises a ball plunger adapted to engage a mating, hemispherical surface <b>98</b> defined by the socket member <b>39</b>, thus controlling any side load which may be imposed upon the rocker arm assembly <b>29</b>. Referring now primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the lash compensation device <b>85</b> includes an upper plunger <b>99</b> having a flat upper surface <b>101</b> which engages an undersurface (&#x201c;fulcrum surface&#x201d;) of the bottom portion <b>59</b> of the inner rocker arm subassembly <b>55</b>. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the undersurface, or fulcrum surface (also referred to by the reference numeral &#x201c;<b>59</b>&#x201d;) of the bottom portion <b>59</b> will engage in some sliding motion relative to the flat upper surface <b>101</b> of the lash compensation device <b>85</b>, in view of the fact that the rocker arm assembly <b>29</b> is restrained from transverse movement, relative to the HLA <b>83</b>, by the engagement of the ball plunger <b>97</b> and the hemispherical surface <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">In accordance with one important aspect of the present invention, each of the first and second lash compensation devices <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> is selectively switchable between a latched condition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and an unlatched condition, as will be described further. It should be understood that, although the latching arrangement illustrated and described herein is of the spring-biased to latch, pressure-biased to unlatch, such is not an essential feature of the invention. The particular details of the latching arrangement utilized form no part of the present invention, except as may be specifically set forth in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">In the subject embodiment, and by way of example only, there is provided within the cylinder head <b>11</b> at least a pair of latch members <b>103</b> for each of the lash compensation devices <b>83</b> and <b>85</b>, although for simplicity of illustration, only one of the latch members <b>103</b> is shown (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</figref>) for each of the devices <b>83</b> and <b>85</b>. As may best be seen in the somewhat fragmentary view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, each latch member <b>103</b> is, in the subject embodiment, biased radially inward by a compression spring <b>105</b>, such that each latch member <b>103</b> engages the respective annular groove <b>89</b> and fixes the vertical position of the body member <b>87</b> within its respective bore <b>79</b> or <b>81</b>. In a manner which is now well know to those skilled in the art, each of the lash compensation devices <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> can be switched from the latched condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to an unlatched condition by communicating pressurized engine oil into the annular groove <b>89</b>, thus biasing the latch members <b>103</b> radially outward, in opposition to the force of the respective compression spring <b>105</b>. However, as noted previously, the present invention is not limited to any particular arrangement for achieving the latching and unlatching of the lash compensation devices <b>83</b> and <b>85</b>, and furthermore, there could be a different latching arrangement utilized for the HLA <b>83</b> than is used for the HLA <b>85</b>. For example, the HLA <b>83</b> could be spring-biased toward the latched condition (as shown), while the HLA <b>85</b> could be spring-biased toward the unlatched condition, and moved toward the latched condition by some means such as electromagnetic actuation, or any other suitable means, the details of which form no essential part of this invention.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">In the unlatched condition, the latch members <b>103</b> are retracted far enough radially such that they are out of engagement with the annular groove <b>89</b>, thus permitting the lash compensation device (<b>83</b> or <b>85</b>) to move within its respective vertical bore (<b>79</b> or <b>81</b>). As is shown only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in each of the vertical bores <b>79</b> and <b>81</b> there is a lost motion spring <b>107</b> biasing the body member <b>87</b> upward within the respective bore <b>79</b> or <b>81</b>, toward the latched condition. Therefore, in the absence of fluid pressure biasing the latch members <b>103</b> radially outward, the lash compensation devices <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> will be biased to the upward, latched condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, thus permitting the latch members to be biased into engagement with the groove <b>89</b> by the springs <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">On the other hand, when there is pressure present in one of the grooves <b>89</b>, the respective HLA (<b>83</b> or <b>85</b>) will be in the unlatched condition, such that rotation of the camshaft <b>21</b> will cause the particular HLA to move downward in its bore (<b>79</b> or <b>81</b>), in opposition to the force of its lost motion spring <b>107</b>. As is well known to those skilled in the art of engine valve controls, the lost motion spring <b>107</b> is selected to provide less biasing force than the valve return spring <b>20</b> so that, when the HLA is unlatched, the respective rocker arm will pivot about the tip portion <b>17</b> of the poppet valve <b>15</b>, and the end of the respective rocker arm engaging the HLA will move vertically up and down with the unlatched HLA (<b>83</b> or <b>85</b>).</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e2518" level="1">Operation</heading>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">Based upon the above explanation and understanding of how each individual HLA and rocker arm operate, depending upon whether the HLA is latched or unlatched, the operation of the entire valve control system of the present invention will now be described. The subsequent description of the operation of the valve control system will, for simplicity, be based upon the assumption of only a single intake poppet valve <b>15</b> per cylinder, and that what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is provided on one of the cylinders intended to have both dual lift and valve deactivation.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">When the engine is operating at a relatively higher speed and/or at a relatively higher engine load, as those terms are generally understood in the art, the engine microprocessor (not shown herein) will provide a suitable command signal, resulting in the discontinuance of control pressure to the annular grooves <b>89</b>. As a result, both the HLA <b>83</b> and the HLA <b>85</b> will be in the latched condition, as was described previously, and the high lift cam profile <b>27</b> will engage the second cam follower <b>61</b>, causing the entire rocker arm assembly <b>29</b> to pivot about the point of engagement of the undersurface of the bottom portion <b>59</b> and the upper surface <b>101</b> of the HLA <b>85</b>. With the rocker arm assembly <b>29</b> now pivoting about the HLA <b>85</b>, which defines a shorter &#x201c;lever arm&#x201d;, the high lift cam profile <b>27</b> causes a relatively larger valve lift to occur, as shown by the lift height designated &#x201c;H&#x201d; in FIG. <b>1</b>. It should be noted that the entire valve control system <b>13</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in the high lift position, as though the camshaft <b>21</b> were rotated so that the high lift cam profile <b>27</b> would be engaging the second cam follower <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">When the engine operates at a relatively lower engine speed and/or at a relatively lower engine load, the engine microprocessor will provide a suitable command signal, resulting in the presence of control pressure in the annular groove <b>89</b> of only the HLA <b>85</b>, such that the HLA <b>85</b> will now be in the unlatched condition, whereas the HLA <b>83</b> will continue in the latched condition. With the HLA <b>83</b> and the HLA <b>85</b> in the particular combination of conditions described above, engagement of the high lift cam profile <b>27</b> with the cam follower <b>61</b> merely results in the inner rocker arm subassembly <b>55</b> pivoting (counterclockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) about the axle shaft <b>53</b>, as described previously, causing the HLA <b>85</b> to move downward in its bore <b>81</b> once for each rotation of the camshaft <b>21</b>, in opposition to the lost motion spring <b>107</b> associated with the HLA <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">At the same time that the HLA <b>85</b> is engaging in &#x201c;lost motion&#x201d;, as described previously, the HLA <b>83</b> remains in the latched condition, such that the entire rocker arm assembly <b>29</b> (and specifically, the outer rocker arm subassembly <b>33</b>) will now pivot about the engagement of the plunger <b>97</b> and the hemispherical surface <b>98</b>. This pivotal movement of the rocker arm assembly will occur in response to the low lift cam profiles <b>25</b> engaging the first cam followers <b>49</b>, and because of the longer &#x201c;lever arm&#x201d; between the plunger <b>97</b> and the cam follower <b>49</b>, and the lower &#x201c;lift&#x201d; provided by the cam profiles <b>25</b>, the result is a relatively smaller valve lift height than the lift height &#x201c;H&#x201d; shown in FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">When the engine is operating at very low load but is cruising at highway speeds, the poppet valve <b>15</b> may be operated in the valve deactivation (&#x201c;cylinder deactivation&#x201d;) condition by providing a suitable command to communicate control pressure to the annular grooves <b>89</b> of both HLA <b>83</b> and HLA <b>85</b>. In this condition, rotation of the camshaft <b>21</b> results in the outer rocker arm subassembly <b>33</b> pivoting about the elephant's foot member <b>45</b>, while the inner rocker arm subassembly <b>55</b> pivots about the axle shaft <b>53</b>, but with no motion being transmitted to the poppet valve <b>15</b>. Instead, the poppet valve <b>15</b> remains in its closed position, under the influence of the return spring <b>20</b>, while both the HLA <b>83</b> and the HLA <b>85</b> reciprocate in their respective bores <b>79</b> and <b>81</b>, overcoming the biasing force of their respective lost motion springs <b>107</b>, once per rotation of the camshaft <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">The invention has been described in great detail in the foregoing specification, and it is believed that various alterations and modifications of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading and understanding of the specification. It is intended that all such alterations and modifications are included in the invention, insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">A multiple cylinder engine controls an air/fuel ratio accurately by improved detection of the fluctuations in a vacuum due to a change in the openings of throttle valves. The multiple cylinder engine includes a plurality of intake passages that independently feed intake air to cylinders; fuel injectors; throttle valves; a pressure sensor; and a fuel controller that controls fuel injection of each cylinder using the detected pressure. The multiple cylinder engine may further include a vacuum inlet passage having an inlet port opened into intake passages that introduces the pressure of the intake passages into the pressure sensor. The vacuum inlet passage preferably includes a throttle portion having a passage area of no more than one ninth that of the inlet port.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e634" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention relates to a multiple cylinder engine such as a V-type 2-cylinder engine and, more particularly, to a multiple cylinder engine capable of controlling an air/fuel ratio accurately.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">In a small general-purpose engine to be used in an agricultural machine, a small-sized power generator or the like, a carburetor is generally employed in an intake system of the engine. In case there is considered the response of the engine at its acceleration/deceleration, the countermeasures against exhaust emissions of recent years and the homogeneous distribution of mixtures, however, it is thought that a fuel injection device (especially, an electronic control type fuel injection system) for injecting fuel directly into the intake pipe is advantageous over the carburetor. From this background, the fuel injection device is being adopted at present.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Here will be briefly described the construction of the fuel injection device by exemplifying a fuel injection type V-type engine for adjusting a fuel injection quantity by measuring an intake pipe vacuum downstream of a throttle valve and by converting the measured vacuum into an intake air flow. This fuel injection device is constituted, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, to include a fuel injection valve <b>81</b>, a fuel pressure adjustor <b>82</b> and a pressure sensor <b>83</b> shared by individual cylinders <b>80</b> and <b>80</b>. An intake passage <b>84</b>, as shared by the individual cylinders <b>80</b> and <b>80</b>, and the fuel pressure adjustor <b>82</b> are connected by conduit <b>86</b>. The intake passage <b>84</b> and the pressure sensor <b>83</b> are connected by conduit <b>85</b>. The pressure sensor <b>83</b> has a vacuum inlet port <b>85</b><i>a</i>, which is opened into the intake passage <b>84</b> downstream of a throttle valve <b>87</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">In the case of this constitution, the intake pressure is averaged conveniently for the fuel pressure adjustor <b>82</b>, even if it is introduced from the intake passage <b>84</b> shared by the two cylinders into the single fuel pressure adjustor <b>82</b>. As the peaks of the intake pressure of the intake pipe are excessive close on the time axis, however, they are unclear for the pressure sensor <b>83</b> to detect, so that the accuracy of the injection quantity control is deteriorated.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e804" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a multiple cylinder engine capable of controlling an air/fuel ratio accurately by accurately detecting the fluctuations of a vacuum in an inlet passage of the engine, due to a change in the openings of throttle valves.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">According to the first aspect of the present invention, a multiple cylinder engine comprises: a plurality of cylinders; a plurality of intake passages for feeding intake air to the individual cylinders independently of each other; a fuel injector provided for each intake passage; a throttle valve provided for each intake passage; a pressure sensor for detecting the pressure of one of the intake passages; and fuel control means for controlling the injection quantity of the fuel injector of each cylinder by using the detected pressure.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">According to aspects of the present invention, the pressure sensor detects the vacuum from one of the intake passages provided independently for each cylinder. With this the detection is not influenced by another cylinder so that it can detect the vacuum accurately. Therefore, the detection accuracy of the intake air flow based on the vacuum is improved, which increases the accuracy of the fuel control by the fuel control means on the basis of the vacuum. Here, an intake air flow of the intake passage, in which the vacuum is not detected, can be obtained from the vacuum in the intake passage, in which the vacuum is detected. The intake air flow of the intake passage, in which the vacuum is not detected, is obtained by predetermining its ratio to the intake air flow of the intake passage, in which the vacuum is detected, and by storing the determined data in the fuel control means.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">Preferably, the multiple cylinder engine further comprises a vacuum inlet passage having an inlet port opened in the intake passage for introducing the pressure of the intake passage into the pressure sensor, and the vacuum inlet passage includes a throttle portion having a passage area of one ninth or less as large as that of the inlet port.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">Thus, if a dynamic pressure is detected at the time of detecting the vacuum value, the peak values and the bottom values of the waveforms of the pressure fluctuations become unclear so that the fluctuations of the vacuum in the air intake passage due to the small change in the openings of the throttle valves are hard to detect. As a result, it is difficult to control the air/fuel ratio accurately. However, with the above structure, the vacuum inlet passage is provided with the throttle portion so that the waveforms of the pressure fluctuations, as might otherwise be made unstable by the influence of the dynamic pressure, are stabilized to clarify the peak values and the bottom values of the waveforms obtained thereby to improve the accuracy of the vacuum detection by the pressure sensor. As a result, it is possible to control the air/fuel ratio accurately. Moreover, the passage area of the throttle portion is set to one ninth or less of that of the inlet port so that the fluctuations of the vacuum due to the small change of the throttle valve opening can be tolerated to detect the vacuum accurately.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">Preferably, a throttle body forming a section of the intake passage and having the throttle valve and an intake port of the cylinders is connected by an intake manifold, and the vacuum inlet passage is formed in the throttle body and a outlet portion of the vacuum inlet passage is formed in the mating face of the throttle body with the intake manifold.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">Thus, the vacuum inlet passage leading to the pressure sensor and the section of the intake passage communicating with the vacuum inlet passage are formed in the throttle body so that a separate member for forming the vacuum inlet passage and mounting parts such as bolts can be eliminated to reduce the number of parts and to facilitate the assembly. Moreover, a outlet portion of the vacuum inlet passage is positioned in a mating face in the throttle body with the intake manifold so that this portion can be easily formed.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">Preferably, the multiple cylinder engine further comprises a fuel pressure adjustor for adjusting the pressure of the fuel to be fed to the fuel injectors. A pressure introduction passage is formed in the throttle body or in the intake manifold for introducing the pressure of the each intake passage into the fuel pressure adjustor. The pressure introduction passage has its leading end portion positioned in the mating face between the throttle body and the intake manifold.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Thus, the pressure introduction passage is formed in the throttle body or in the intake manifold, and its leading end portion is positioned in the mating face between the throttle body and the intake manifold so that separate members for forming those passages and mounting parts such as bolts can be eliminated to reduce the number of parts and to facilitate the assembly. Moreover, the pressure introduction passage has its leading end portion positioned in the mating face between the throttle body and the intake manifold so that it can be easily formed.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">Preferably, the leading end portion includes an expansion chamber and an introduction port for connecting the expansion chamber to the each intake passage. The introduction port has a passage area set smaller than a maximum passage area of the expansion chamber.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">Thus, air introduced from the intake passages into the introduction port is averaged gently in its pressure by the expansion chamber. When the air is introduced from the expansion chamber into the fuel pressure adjustor, therefore, the fuel pressure can be adjusted to the optimum by the fuel pressure adjustor.</p>

<p id="P-00028" num="00028">A V-type 2-cylinder engine according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to FIG. <b>5</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the V-type 2-cylinder engine <b>1</b> is a general-purpose engine to be used in an industrial machine, an agricultural machine or the like. The V-type 2-cylinder engine <b>1</b> includes: cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> arranged in the V-shape at different angle (e.g., 90 degrees) positions around a crank axis CT; a throttle body <b>4</b> (although only its front end flange portion is shown) arranged in the V-shaped space (or the bank space) between those cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>; and an intake manifold <b>5</b> interposed between the throttle body <b>4</b> and the intake ports <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the two cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. The throttle body <b>4</b> is connected, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to an upper air cleaner D through an intake duct member <b>15</b> which is mounted on a front end flange face <b>4</b><i>e</i>. On the bottom portion of the air cleaner D, there is mounted an intake temperature sensor A for detecting the temperature of the cleaned air in the air cleaner D.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">The individual cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are provided with cylinder bodies <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, in which pistons P are slidably fitted, and cylinder heads <b>2</b><i>c </i>and <b>3</b><i>c</i>. These cylinder heads <b>2</b><i>c </i>and <b>3</b><i>c </i>are provided with ignition plugs <b>2</b><i>d </i>and <b>3</b><i>d </i>and intake valves <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>3</b><i>e</i>. The reciprocal motions of the pistons P are transmitted as rotational motions through a connecting rod R to a crankshaft K.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">Between the individual cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, moreover, there are mounted fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, which are inclined and have their leading end nozzles <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>oriented obliquely downward to the outer side. These fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> are individually mounted in mounting holes <b>8</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b</i>, which are formed at symmetrical positions in the intake manifold <b>5</b>, through ring-shaped rubber seals <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>with the leading end nozzles <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>being directed toward the intake ports <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the individual cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">In the V-type 2-cylinder engine <b>1</b>, moreover, there are formed two intake passages <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>for feeding the intake air independently to the individual cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. The throttle body <b>4</b> is provided with two intake passages <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>forming sections of the intake passages <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the intake passages <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>are individually provided therein with throttle valves <b>4</b><i>c</i>. In the intake duct member <b>15</b>, too, there are formed two intake passages <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>which communicate with the intake passages <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>to form sections of the intake passages <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">On the upper side of the throttle body <b>4</b>, there is disposed an injection fuel introduction portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>of a fuel passage <b>12</b>. Two fuel introduction pipes <b>13</b> for feeding the fuel from the injection fuel introduction portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>to the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are fitted and supported between the throttle body <b>4</b> and the intake manifold <b>5</b> respectively. The fuel introduction pipes <b>13</b> are supported in such a manner that protrusions <b>13</b><i>a </i>formed at one-side end of the fuel introduction pipe <b>13</b> is inserted into a positioning hole <b>5</b><i>a </i>formed in the intake manifold <b>5</b>, and a leading end portion of the fuel introduction pipe <b>13</b> is inserted into a fuel introduction pipe mounting hole <b>12</b><i>b </i>formed in the fuel introduction portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>through O-rings <b>12</b><i>c</i>, as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>. As a result, the fuel introduction pipes <b>13</b> are supported between the throttle body <b>4</b> and the intake manifold <b>5</b>. Moreover, the throttle body <b>4</b> and the intake manifold <b>5</b> are fixed by bolts <b>21</b><i>b </i>which are fastened in threaded holes <b>17</b> of the intake manifold <b>5</b> shown in FIG. <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">In the upper portion of the throttle body <b>4</b>, moreover, there is formed a vacuum inlet passage <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for extracting the intake pressure of the intake passage <b>11</b><i>a </i>downstream of the throttle valve <b>4</b><i>c</i>, and the leading end of the vacuum inlet passage <b>18</b> is connected to a pressure sensor C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) so that the intake pressure in one intake passage <b>11</b><i>a </i>(or the other intake passage <b>11</b><i>b</i>) can be detected by the pressure sensor C. This pressure sensor C is mounted on the back portion of the intake manifold <b>5</b> through a bracket <b>19</b>, as shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. The pressure value detected by the pressure sensor C is sent as a detection signal to a computer <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or fuel control means. With a map programmed in advance in the computer <b>20</b>, the fuel injection rates of the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> of the individual cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are determined from the relationship between the pressure value and the engine speed rpm. In this determination of the fuel injection rates, the detection data of the intake temperature sensor A and a water thermometer B inserted in a cooling water passage <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are also inputted to the computer <b>20</b> so that the injection rates of the fuel are corrected.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">On the other hand, the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are inserted between the fuel introduction pipes <b>13</b> and the intake manifold <b>5</b> and supported in a sealed state such that their leading end nozzles <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>are supported through the rubber seals <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>in the mounting holes <b>8</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the intake manifold <b>5</b> and such that their root end sides are inserted into the fuel injector inserting holes <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the fuel introduction pipes <b>13</b> through shock absorbing dampers <b>6</b><i>a </i>and O-rings <b>6</b><i>b</i>, as described by representing the case of the fuel injector <b>6</b> in FIG. <b>4</b>. Here, the injection fuel introduction portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>is desirably formed integrally with the throttle body <b>4</b>, but may also be constructed by making it as a separate member and by mounting it on the throttle body <b>4</b> by mounting means such as fasteners.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">Between and slightly over the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is mounted a common fuel pressure adjustor <b>14</b> for adjusting the pressure of the fuel to be fed to the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>. This fuel pressure adjustor <b>14</b> is connected in a sealed state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, by mounting a bypass pipe portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>extended from its front portion (as located on the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) through an O-ring <b>14</b><i>b </i>in a fuel pressure adjustor mounting hole <b>4</b><i>d </i>formed in the throttle body <b>4</b>, and is mounted on the throttle body <b>4</b> by means of not-shown bolts.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">Moreover, the fuel pressure adjustor <b>14</b> is arranged, as shown in a top plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, on one side (or the front side) across the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> in the longitudinal direction along the rotation axis CT of the engine. On the other side (or the rear side), there is arranged the pressure sensor C for detecting the pressure in the intake passages <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the fuel in the fuel tank (although not shown) is introduced through the injection fuel introduction portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>into the fuel introduction pipes <b>13</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by attaching the fuel pipe from the fuel tank to a fuel connection pipe <b>16</b> which is connected to the injection fuel introduction portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>in the throttle body <b>4</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fuel introduced into the injection fuel introduction portion <b>12</b><i>a </i>flows, as indicated by a solid arrow a, from the fuel introduction pipes <b>13</b> into the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> (FIG. <b>2</b>), whereas the excess fuel is returned, as indicated by a dotted arrow b, from the fuel pressure adjustor <b>14</b> via a return passage <b>28</b> to the fuel tank. With this arrangement, the fuel injection type V-type 2-cylinder engine can be easily reconstructed by replacing the carburetor of the general carburetor type V-type 2-cylinder engine and the manifold for the carburetor, by the throttle body <b>4</b> and the intake manifold <b>5</b>. In accordance with the needs, therefore, the specifications can be quickly changed from the carburetor type to the fuel injection device type of the invention.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">At an intake stroke of the V-type 2-cylinder engine thus constructed, as the intake valves <b>2</b><i>e </i>and <b>3</b><i>e </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are opened and the pistons P go down, the pressures in the cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> drop so that the air is sucked from the intake passages <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>formed in the throttle body <b>4</b> and the intake manifold <b>5</b>. At this time, the intake vacuum of the sucked air is detected in a high accuracy by the pressure sensor C (FIG. <b>5</b>), and the detected value obtained is inputted together with the engine speed to the computer <b>20</b> or the fuel control means so that the fuel injection rate is determined. At this time, the detected data of the intake temperature sensor A and the water thermometer B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are also inputted to the computer <b>20</b> to correct the injection rates determined. On the basis of the instructions of the computer <b>20</b>, moreover, the injection rates by the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> are controlled, and the fuels in the controlled injection rates are injected from the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> into the intake passages <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the intake manifold <b>5</b> so that the optimum mixtures are homogeneously distributed and fed to the cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">Here, the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> are individually provided for each cylinder <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> in the V-space of the engine so that the mixtures can be homogeneously distributed. Moreover, not only the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> but also the accompanying fuel pressure adjustor <b>14</b> is arranged in the V-space, and the intake passages <b>11</b><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b </i>and the fuel passage <b>12</b> are integrally formed in the throttle body <b>4</b> and the intake manifold <b>5</b>, so that the pipes to be employed can be reduced to the necessary minimum to make a compact structure as a whole. Moreover, the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> and the fuel introduction pipes <b>13</b> are mounted on the throttle body <b>4</b> and the intake manifold <b>5</b> by not fastening but inserting them, so that their mountability and assembling performance are improved.</p>

In order to make the details of the vacuum inlet passage <b>18</b> especially understandable, however, the fuel injectors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> and the fuel pressure adjustor <b>14</b> are omitted in FIG. <b>6</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for convenience.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the vacuum inlet passage <b>18</b> is formed by extending it normal to a flange face <b>4</b><i>f </i>of a mating face with the intake manifold <b>5</b> in the throttle body <b>4</b>. The vacuum inlet passage <b>18</b> is provided at its one end with an inlet port <b>18</b><i>a </i>opened into one intake passage <b>4</b><i>a </i>(or <b>11</b><i>a</i>) and at its other end with a thin groove <b>18</b>c of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (outlet portion of the vacuum inlet passage) opened in the flange face <b>4</b><i>f</i>.

In the vacuum inlet passage <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is formed a throttle portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>which has a passage area set to about one ninth or less as large as the passage area of the inlet port <b>18</b><i>a</i>. If the passage area of the throttle portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>exceeds about one ninth of that of the inlet port <b>18</b><i>a</i>, the vacuum value to be detected by the pressure sensor C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) may be made unstable by the influences of a dynamic pressure.</p>

Moreover, the detection path may be formed over the intake manifold <b>5</b> and the throttle body <b>4</b> by forming, for example, only the introduction ports <b>25</b><i>b </i>and <b>25</b><i>c </i>in the intake manifold <b>5</b> and by forming the remaining portion in the throttle body <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">According to the vacuum detecting means thus constructed, the pressure detected by the pressure sensor C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is the vacuum from one intake passage <b>4</b><i>a </i>(or <b>11</b><i>a</i>) but not the vacuums from a plurality of intake passages, and the vacuum is not averaged so that it can be accurately detected.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">Therefore, the detection accuracy of the intake air flow based on the vacuum is improved to increase the accuracy of the fuel control by the computer <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) on the basis of the vacuum. Here, the intake air flow of the intake passage <b>11</b><i>b</i>, the vacuum of which is not detected, can be easily obtained from the vacuum, i.e., the intake air flow of the intake passage <b>11</b><i>a</i>, the vacuum of which is detected, by predetermining the ratio of the intake air flow of the intake passage <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the intake passage <b>11</b><i>b </i>and by storing the ratio data in the computer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">Concerning the pressure sensor C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, moreover, the detected vacuum value is so stabilized in the waveform of the pressure fluctuations by the existence of the throttle portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>disposed in the vacuum inlet passage <b>18</b> that the peak value and the bottom value become clear, as illustrated in FIG. <b>8</b>(A). Therefore, the fuel injection rate can be adjusted to establish a desired air/fuel ratio. Without the throttle portion, as illustrated in FIG. <b>8</b>(B), the pressure fluctuations are made unstable by the influences of the dynamic pressure so that the peak value and the bottom value become unclear, resulting in failure to establish the desired air/fuel ratio.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">Here, the embodiment thus far described has been exemplified especially by the V-type 2-cylinder engine, but the present invention can be similarly applied to all other multiple cylinder engines.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e619" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention relates to a device for storage and conveyance of bulky holders, in particular containers.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Container terminals are generally known and are used for the temporary storage and subsequent distribution of containers, which are brought into a seaport in large numbers in, for example, container ships, and are then transported further by rail in goods trains, by road in lorries or on waterways in smaller vessels. In order to permit temporary storage of the large quantity of containers, said containers are stacked on top of one another in rows spaced apart in a storage yard, generally with the aid of mobile gantry cranes operated by crane drivers. The free space between the rows is necessary for the tracks along which the mobile cranes can move. When a particular container from such a stack has to be transported further, the containers stacked on top of this particular container first have to be moved to a free position before the particular container can be removed from the stack and delivered for further distribution to a generally centrally situated discharge point. Such movements take a relatively large amount of time. Moreover, it is found in practice that a container, once stored, is often moved about ten times before it is removed from the storage site. However, each movement usually has to be paid for, which incurs additional costs. Furthermore, the space is being used inefficiently, since aisles are needed between the rows for the gantry cranes.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">The same problem occurs in distribution centres, where pallets or other holders filled with goods are stored temporarily on racks comprising several levels. Here again, aisles have to be present between the racks and at their ends, for forklift trucks or the like which supply and remove the pallets. A large amount of floor space is therefore needed. However, the pallets are not stacked directly on top of one another and can therefore be removed individually from the racks.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">A solution known from the trade is described in, for example, WO 94/06708, which discloses a storage system for bulky holders, in particular containers used in aircraft. This system consists of a number of storage levels, each consisting of mutually parallel, individually operable endless horizontal longitudinal conveyors with storage bays for the stored holders. On each level, provision is made for (endless) transverse conveyors at least at the two ends of the horizontal longitudinal conveyors. Aisles between the horizontal longitudinal conveyors are therefore not required.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">A disadvantage of such a system is that separate drives, such as chain drives, are needed for each conveyor, as are separate intermediate parts, for example roller conveyors, for transferring a container from a longitudinal conveyor to a transverse conveyor.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">EP-A-0 145 871 also discloses a device for the storage and conveyance of containers, in which a so-called &#x201c;Doppelfahrwagen&#x201d; (double carriage), which can travel along a network of rails provided with crossover points, is used. Such a carriage is provided with a first travelling mechanism comprising several sets of first travelling wheels, for movement in a first direction, and with a second travelling mechanism comprising several sets of second travelling wheels, for movement in another direction, generally transversely to the first direction, the travelling mechanisms being adjustable in height relative to each other, so that when the first travelling mechanism is resting on the rails and the second has been retracted the carriage with load can move in the first direction, and vice versa. The change in direction of movement can be made at the crossover points. This means that turntables, bends and the like in the network are not needed. These carriages known from EP-A 0 145 871 are provided with a lifting table, so that no additional aids, such as cranes and the like, are needed for loading and unloading.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">Disadvantages of this known system are that drives are needed for moving the carriages, and that each carriage has to be provided with a double travelling mechanism.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e659" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">The object of the present invention is to reduce the abovementioned problems, in particular to limit the number of drives and in doing so to keep the construction relatively simple, while the possibility of automation and also efficient utilization of space are retained.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">To that end, the present invention provides a device for storage and conveyance of bulky holders, comprising at least one tier, each tier comprising at least one conveyance circuit for the holders, and each conveyance circuit comprising at least two longitudinal paths disposed substantially parallel to each other, for conveyance of the holders in the direction of the longitudinal paths, which longitudinal paths each define a first predetermined number (N) of adjoining holder positions for the holders, while two adjacent longitudinal paths of a conveyance circuit slope from the same end in opposite directions, and also comprising transverse tracks situated at the opposite ends of the longitudinal paths and movable at least in the vertical direction, for conveyance of the holders in the direction of the transverse tracks, which transverse tracks can transfer the holders to and from the longitudinal paths, and also comprising a second predetermined maximum number (M&#x2266;2*N&#x2212;1) of carriers which are movable along the longitudinal paths and transverse tracks and are designed to take one or more holders, lifting means being provided for moving the transverse tracks in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">The device according to the invention comprises at least one tier, and preferably several tiers, situated above one another on a suitable frame of, for example, concrete columns with cross beams. Holders such as pallets or containers can be stored and conveyed on each tier. For this purpose, a conveyance circuit is provided on each tier, along which the stored holders can be conveyed one behind the other with the aid of the movable carriers, substantially under the influence of gravity. Each conveyance circuit comprises at least two, and preferably also two, longitudinal paths which run parallel to each other, but slope from one end in opposite directions. Transverse tracks which are movable in the vertical direction form connecting routes for the holders at the ends of the longitudinal paths, so that the whole system forms a closed circuit. The device is further provided with carriers which are movable along the longitudinal paths and transverse tracks. The length of a longitudinal path is such that a predetermined number (N) of carriers with holders fit on it. The total number of carriers (M) is then less than or equal to 2*N&#x2212;1, so that a free position in the conveyance circuit is present in each case. This makes movement possible. Since the longitudinal paths are disposed in a sloping manner, an angle of inclination of 0.20 being sufficient for 8 standard 40-foot containers disposed crosswise, the containers disposed upon the carriers, as a result of gravity, have the tendency to move by themselves towards the lowest point, so that additional drives are not needed. In order to transfer a carrier situated at one end of a longitudinal path to an adjoining longitudinal path, the transverse tracks forming the transverse connection at the ends of the longitudinal paths are movable in the vertical direction, so that the carrier is temporarily lifted up from a longitudinal path and is moved along the transverse tracks, preferably again under the influence of gravity, if the transverse tracks are provided with a suitable angle of inclination. Thereafter, the carrier is allowed to rest upon the adjoining longitudinal path again, so that further movement along the latter is possible. The lifting means, for example hydraulic piston/cylinder assemblies, are provided for this vertical movement, which is accompanied by a slight tilt if necessary.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">The operation of the device is relatively simple. A tier with 2*N positions for holders and 2*N-1 carriers is filled with holders, in principle one on each carrier. However, the carriers may be arranged in such a way that several holders with smaller dimensions fit on them. When a certain holder has to be transported further from there, the circuit in question is put into operation, the carriers being allowed to circulate until the holder in question is situated at a discharge point of a longitudinal path, where said holder can be removed from the circuit. The holder is lifted off a carrier using suitable means, for example a forklift truck. A new holder can be placed on the empty carrier and stored in this way.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">The carriers are advantageously mobile along the longitudinal paths, and to that end comprise rows of wheels which are spaced apart and are rotatable in the longitudinal direction of the longitudinal paths. Although in principle a limited number of wheels (e.g. 4) will suffice, it is preferable to use a large number of relatively small wheels, so that if one wheel becomes defective, the entire system does not come to a standstill. The wheels may be disposed on a common axle or otherwise.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">The end sections of the longitudinal paths preferably comprise guides for the wheels, which guides are spaced apart, for example guides with an L-profile or an inverted T-profile, such as rails, or guides in the form of a channel (inverted U-profile), the space between the guides being at least partially open, for a reason to be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">The transverse tracks are advantageously composed of rotatable discs or wheels which are disposed one after the other in rows and are rotatable about a horizontal shaft and in the longitudinal direction of the transverse tracks or wheels, along which the carriers are movable in the longitudinal direction of the transverse tracks. According to a further embodiment, each disc is mounted on the head of a piston/cylinder assembly, which piston/cylinder assemblies form the lifting means for the transverse tracks and are movable from the bottom vertically upwards into the open spaces between the guides of the end positions of the longitudinal paths. It will be understood that the, stroke of the piston/cylinder assemblies disposed at the end of the longitudinal paths, where the latter have the greatest mutual height difference, must be greater than that of the piston/cylinder assemblies at the other end. In order to ensure that a carrier can roll correctly over the discs, guides such as inverted U-profiles are advantageously provided between the rows of wheels on the underside of the carrier, for accommodating and guiding the rotatable discs, which guides extend in the transverse direction of the carrier.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">Since the carriers are positioned in a virtually horizontal position by means of the transverse tracks, before the carriers can be transferred from one longitudinal path by way of the transverse tracks to an adjoining longitudinal path, blocking means are advantageously provided in the longitudinal paths, in particular for the carriers in the penultimate positions, so that sufficient distance is present between the holders on the last (lowest) carrier and penultimate carrier to allow the horizontal positioning. Blocks which can be lowered in the surface are an example of such blocking means, which are actuated, for example, when sensors detect the presence of a carrier in the last position. Spacers between the carriers can produce the same effect, but lead to an overall lengthening and widening of the conveyance circuit with the same number of carriers.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">The device according to the invention advantageously has for each conveyance circuit a supply point for supplying new holders when an empty carrier is present, and a removal point for removing a stored holder. These points are advantageously situated at the same ends of the longitudinal paths, in other words, at the head end, so that the holders can be supplied and removed there using one and the same aid, such as a forklift truck. The supply point and removal point of a conveyance circuit are advantageously, situated at the ends of the longitudinal paths, where the height difference is minimal.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">For an automated device according to the invention, detection points are advantageously present both at the supply point and at the removal point, for detection and identification of the holders. The detection system in question, for example a camera identification system, is dependent upon the type of coding present, on the holders. When a new holder is fed into a conveyance circuit, the data of the holder are detected and stored in a computer, together with the data of the conveyance circuit concerned. The computer forms part of the control system of the device. When a particular holder has to be removed from storage, the circuit concerned is put into operation, until through circulation the presence of this particular holder is detected at the removal point.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">Several adjoining conveyance circuits, each consisting of two longitudinal paths, are advantageously present for each tier.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">The device can also be provided with a further conveyor, which moves along each supply and removal point of a conveyance circuit, and on which lifting means for conveying, supplying and removing the holders are disposed in a movable manner.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">The invention also relates to a container terminal provided with a device according to the invention.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e804" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>to <b>1</b><i>e </i>show diagrammatically in top view the circulation route of containers C<sub>m</sub>, E representing an empty position. The direction of circulation is indicated by arrows. A conveyance circuit is indicated by reference numeral <b>2</b>, said conveyance circuit consisting of a longitudinal path <b>4</b> and a longitudinal path <b>6</b>, which is disposed parallel to and adjoining longitudinal path <b>4</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a diagrammatic side view of the situation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>. The longitudinal paths <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> have opposite angles of inclination of approximately 0.2&#xb0;, which is greatly exaggerated in this figure for the sake of clarity. For the sake of simplicity, transverse tracks are not shown in these <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. In the situation shown, each longitudinal path has eight positions for carriers with containers. The longitudinal path <b>4</b> is filled with carriers with containers C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>8</sub>, while the longitudinal path <b>6</b> comprises containers C<sub>9</sub>-C<sub>15 </sub>and also has an empty position E that corresponds to the top end position of the longitudinal path <b>6</b>. The carrier with container C<sub>1 </sub>can be moved in a manner to be described in greater detail from the longitudinal path <b>4</b> to the empty position E of the longitudinal path <b>6</b>, so that an empty position E arises in the lowest end position of the longitudinal path <b>4</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. By their own weight, the carriers with containers C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>8 </sub>subsequently each drop one position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, so that the empty position E now arises at the top end of the longitudinal path <b>4</b>. The carrier with container C<sub>9 </sub>can be lifted up on a vertically movable transverse track until it is above the top end of the longitudinal path <b>4</b> and can subsequently be moved along the transverse track to the top position of longitudinal path <b>4</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d</i>. The empty position E, which is now situated at the bottom end of longitudinal path <b>6</b>, will be filled by the series of containers C<sub>10</sub>-C<sub>1 </sub>moving under the influence of gravity, leading to the situation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>e</i>, from which it can be seen that all containers C have moved up one position. The cycle described above will be repeated during operation of the device according to the invention for the number of times that it takes for a desired container to be situated at a removal point <b>10</b>, which is preferably the position at the bottom end of the top longitudinal path <b>4</b>, while a supply point <b>12</b> is preferably the position at the top end of the bottom longitudinal path <b>6</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a detection system <b>11</b> can be present at both the supply point <b>12</b> and the removal point <b>10</b> for detection identification of the holders. The detection system <b>11</b> can include a first camera <b>13</b> positioned at the supply point <b>12</b> and a second camera <b>15</b> positioned at the removal point <b>10</b>. The cameras <b>13</b> and <b>15</b> can detect a coding <b>17</b> on the holders.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each longitudinal path <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> comprises a bearing structure along which a carrier <b>14</b> with container (not shown) can travel. For that purpose, the carrier <b>14</b> is provided with rows of wheels <b>16</b> which are spaced apart in the direction of travel, and of which only the outermost wheels of each row are visible in side view. The wheels <b>16</b> of a certain row can be mounted on a common horizontal axle <b>18</b>, or each wheel can be provided with its own axle. The resulting mobile carrier <b>14</b> is provided with suitable means for fixing the containers, for example of the type used for fixing on lorries or rail wagons, for example pins <b>24</b> which can be recessed in the top surface <b>22</b> of the carrier <b>14</b>, which pins, for the fixing, project into fitted holes of the container. An end section <b>26</b> of a longitudinal path <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> comprises guides <b>28</b>, running parallel, viewed in the direction of travel, the number of which corresponds to the number of wheels <b>16</b> in a row. Open spaces <b>30</b> are present between the guides <b>28</b> in the end section <b>26</b>. A number of piston/cylinder assemblies <b>34</b> are disposed vertically below these open spaces <b>30</b> in the guides <b>28</b> on the tier floor <b>32</b>. A rotatable disc <b>40</b> is mounted on the head <b>36</b> of each piston <b>38</b> in such a way that it can rotate about a horizontal shaft as <b>42</b>, the direction of rotation of a rotatable disc <b>40</b> extending transversely to the longitudinal paths <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, i.e. in the direction of movement of the transverse tracks. These rotatable discs <b>40</b> form the transverse tracks along which a carrier <b>14</b> can be moved from a longitudinal path <b>4</b> to an adjoining longitudinal path <b>6</b>, and vice versa. On the underside of the carrier <b>14</b>, inverted U-profiles <b>44</b> are fixed between the rows of wheels <b>16</b>, which profiles extend across the entire width of a carrier <b>14</b> and ensure correct movement of the carrier <b>14</b> along the rotatable discs <b>40</b>. In order to make the transverse movement possible when a carrier <b>14</b> is situated in the bottom end position of a longitudinal path, the pistons <b>38</b> are extended until the carrier <b>14</b> is no longer resting upon the guides <b>28</b>, but is resting with the U-profiles <b>44</b> upon the rotatable discs <b>40</b> and is situated substantially in a horizontal position. A sloping track can be formed by subsequently operating in a controlled manner the rows of piston/cylinder assemblies disposed in the transverse direction of the transverse tracks, along which sloping track the carrier <b>14</b> will move under the influence of gravity until said carrier is situated above an end section of the adjoining longitudinal path <b>6</b>, after which the carrier <b>14</b> is again taken substantially into a horizontal position by correct operation of the piston/cylinder assemblies and is subsequently placed in a position corresponding to the angle of inclination of the longitudinal path <b>6</b> and then set on the guides <b>28</b> by retraction of the pistons <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">In order to prevent following carriers with containers from resting against the carrier <b>14</b> with container in the end position and making it impossible for the latter to be moved into a horizontal position, spacers <b>46</b> are provided at the ends of the carriers <b>14</b>, and blocking means, for example blocks <b>48</b> which can be recessed in the guides <b>28</b> and block further movement of the next carrier, can also be provided. When the last position is free, the blocking means <b>48</b> are put out of action, so that the series of carriers can move up one position in the longitudinal path.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">Although the above description focuses on a storage device for containers, it will be understood that the device according to the invention can also be used for other holders, for example pallets.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">A wing for a traction kite, etc comprises a plurality of cells formed by chordwise-extending ribs (<b>3</b>), valved openings (<b>6</b>) to the cells allowing ram air to inflate the wing. By changing the initial cut-out of the material forming the cells near wing tips (<b>7, 8</b>), compared with that of the cells central to the wing, it is possible to alter the aerodynamic forces at wing tips (<b>7, 8</b>). This allows attachment of flying lines (<b>9, 10</b>) to wing tips (<b>7, 8</b>) only, despite the wing having no framing to maintain its spanwise shape under the loading of flying lines (<b>9, 10</b>). The increased aerodynamic forces at wing tips (<b>7, 8</b>) are achieved by making the aerofoil profiles of the cells progressively more reflexive towards wing tips (<b>7, 8</b>), by giving wing tips (<b>7, 8</b>) a residual twist increasing their angle of incidence, by placing the centres of pressure of the cells near wing tips (<b>7, 8</b>) somewhat forward of the pivot line of the wing, etc.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e653" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The invention relates to aerodynamic devices or wings of a type commonly referred to as kites and in particular to a special category of kite generally referred to as a traction kite, which is used to propel a person across land, ice, snow or water.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e663" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">While the following discussion and description will be provided in the context of traction kiting, this application is not intended to be limiting. The aerodynamic device of the invention may be used in other flying situations.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Unless the context requires otherwise, in the following description the terms &#x201c;kite&#x201d; and &#x201c;wing&#x201d; are interchangeable and refer to an aerodynamic device that is connected to its operator and/or their ski, skis, skates, board, buggy, or boat, by two or more lines, henceforth called flying lines. These flying lines restrain the kite, allow it to be manoeuvred in the air, and by their extension or shortening relative to each other can be used to effect control of the kite by the operator.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Traction kiting, where a kite is used to propel the kite's operator across the surface of the land, ice, snow, or water is becoming increasingly popular. The flier or operator of the kite dons a ski, or board, or pair of ski's, or skates, or stands on a board, or sits in a buggy or boat or kayak, whichever suits the type of surface and the style of traction kiting they wish to indulge, and uses the kite to harness energy from wind in order to propel themselves and their ski, skis, skates, board, buggy or boat across the surface of the land, ice, snow, or water.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Kite designs may be broadly characterised according to their construction. The range of constructions covers a broad spectrum from framed, semi-framed or unframed single skin kites to double skinned, or &#x201c;ram air&#x201d; type kites, to hybrid combinations of these various types. Regardless of their construction type, all kites must have some means of maintaining their spanwise shape while flying.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Four ways of forming or contributing to the form of the spanwise shape of a wing while it is flying are:
<ul id="ul100001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul100002-li00002">
    <ul id="ul100002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul100002-p00008" num="00008">Firstly, the use of a rigid or semi-rigid frame.</li>
        <li id="ul100002-p00009" num="00009">Secondly, to contrive for air pressurised by being taken from, at or near a flow stagnation point to bleed into internal spaces within the wing, which pressurised air then functions as a structural element. This is referred to as the ram air system after Jalbert (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 3,285,546).</li>
        <li id="ul100002-p00010" num="00010">Thirdly, by arranging for some elements of the wing's aerodynamic surfaces to be otherwise than perpendicular to the general axis of the flying lines and set so as to generate aerodynamic forces that cause the wing tips to pull away from each other.</li>
        <li id="ul100002-p00011" num="00011">Fourthly, by the use of multiple bridle lines attached to the wing at intervals spanwise and chordwise and converging to the flying lines at a point or points between the operator and the wing. Such bridles, by distributing the tension in the flying lines more evenly over the surface of the wing, reduce the bending load on spanwise structural elements and therefore assisting in the retention of spanwise form.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">In the case of kites with rigid or semi-rigid frames, multiple bridles make it possible for these frame elements to be proportionally smaller and lighter, both of which are advantageous to the kite's performance by reducing respectively, drag and weight.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">In the case of conventional Jalbert or Parapent style foil kites that use ram air inflation as their structural element, the pressure differential available is so small as to allow no possibility of sufficient spanwise beam strength without support from multiple bridles spaced at intervals spanwise. Because more bridles allow thinner and more aerodynamically efficient aerofoil sections to be used and also permit higher aspect ratio form thereby reducing induced drag there has been a tendency in recent years for parafoil style traction kites to have upwards of 60 bridles.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">In the case where aerodynamic forces are used to retain or assist in the retention of spanwise form, multiple bridles reduce the proportion of the kite's aerodynamic surfaces that are required to be other than approximately perpendicular to the flying lines and hence increase the proportion of surface area that can be applied directly to supplying pull on the flying lines. An advantageous consequence of this can be a higher lift coefficient, which manifests as more pull in proportion to overall size.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">Bridle lines do however, in themselves, add undesirable drag and can tangle during launching or flying in such a way as to prevent satisfactory operation of the kite.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Traction kites using various combinations of these four contributions to spanwise shape are known and used. Each have inherent advantages and disadvantages by cost, tangle resistance, luff resistance, power for size, upwind efficiency, packing ease, relaunch ease (especially from water), gust responsiveness and other values.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">An example of a traction kite using mainly a combination of multiple bridle lines and aerodynamic forces to hold spanwise form is described in WO99/59866. This kite has a very flexible spar or bundle of spars comprising the leading edge of the kite and multiple panels, separated from each other by sets of bridles arranged in the flow wise direction and with these panels arranged and shaped so that the aerodynamic pressure distribution around them provides the major contribution to the spanwise form for the kite.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">An example of a traction kite using a combination of only aerodynamic forces and multiple bridles to hold its spanwise form and with no rigid, semi-rigid or ram air structural elements is what has become known as the NASA wing. This kite has a single skin, shaped, and supported by bridles in such a way as to generate aerodynamic forces that are sufficient to form the spanwise and chordwise shape of the kite.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">An example of a traction kite using ram air inflation as its spanwise structural element in combination with multiple bridle lines is described in Schimmelpfennig (U.S. Pat. No. 5,033,698). This kite is a double skin ram air inflated envelope with aerofoil profile ribs, without any frame but with multiple bridles distributed spanwise over the surface of the kite, and primarily near to the kite's leading edge, to assist retention of spanwise form. It does not use any significant contribution from aerodynamic forces to hold its spanwise shape beyond a small degree of &#x201c;arch&#x201d; form as is commonly used in foil type kites to offset the spanwise components of bridle tension that derives from their convergence to the flying lines.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">An example of a traction kite using ram air inflation in combination with a spanwise semi-rigid structural element and some contribution to spanwise form from aerodynamic forces but without multiple bridling is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,363,458. This kite is a double skin ram air inflated aerofoil with a semi-rigid spar spanning its leading edge. Two only flying lines are used, one attached to each wing tip at the leading edge. The trailing edge of the kite is unsupported by bridles or flying lines.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">An example of a traction kite using a semi-rigid frame in combination with a single skin and spanwise aerodynamic forces but without multiple bridles or at least with very few bridles is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,708,078. This kite has a structure of inflated tubes covered by a flexible skin. The tubes can be inflated through one or more sealable orifices using an inflatable boat pump for example to pressures significantly greater than would be available by ram air inflation. These tubes form a semi-rigid spar along the leading edge of the kite and usually also a series of flow wise orientated spines extending from the leading edge to the trailing edge at intervals across the span of the kite. The tubes must remain correctly inflated to maintain the shape required for the kite to fly satisfactorily.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">To date there has been no disclosure of a kite that successfully uses the combination of only ram air inflation and aerodynamic forces to hold its spanwise form.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved aerodynamic device, which may be flown as a kite, including as a traction kite, which requires neither rigid nor semi-rigid structural elements spanwise and that, additionally, does not require the use of bridles distributed spanwise, or at least to provide the public with a useful choice.</p>

<p id="P-00024" num="00024">According to a broadest aspect the invention provides for a ram air inflated wing including:

<heading id="heading-d0e1082" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="P-00057" num="00057">A perspective view of a wing according to the invention is shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. The wing is a double skinned ram air inflated aerofoil profile wing made from flexible lightweight material. One uniqueness of this wing is that it is able to maintain its spanwise, approximately, semicircular shape without any form of rigid or semi-rigid frame at all and without any flying line attachment directly or indirectly through two or more leg bridling to anywhere on the wing except at or near the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00058" num="00058">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a two line wing with single point line attachment, one at each tip <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. However, to enable greater control the wing can also be made for use with four flying lines, a front and rear line on each end of tip <b>7</b> and a front and rear line on each end of tip <b>8</b>. There are a number of possible arrangements for flying line attachments and some of these will be discussed later.</p>
<p id="P-00059" num="00059">The wing is constructed of an upper fabric skin surface <b>1</b> and a lower fabric skin surface <b>2</b> joined along their longer edges to provide a leading edge <b>4</b> and a trailing edge <b>5</b>. The upper and lower skins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are each made of a number of smaller panels joined together. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> where the first four panels, <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>1</b><i>c</i>, and <b>1</b><i>d </i>which make up the tip section of upper skin <b>1</b> are shown. The upper and lower skins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are also joined at ends, or tips, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> to form a generally airtight elongate envelope. There are a number of sheet materials, including fabrics, known in the art that are suitable for constructing such a wing envelope and their methods of joining are well known.</p>
<p id="P-00060" num="00060">A plurality of interior walls, generally called ribs, <b>3</b> are transversely interposed between the upper and lower skins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> throughout the interior of the envelope. These ribs <b>3</b> subdivide the interior of the envelope into a plurality of compartments generally called cells. The ribs <b>3</b> are positioned at regular intervals across the span of the wing. In the current embodiment of the wing there are nineteen ribs <b>3</b> and twenty cells although this number is not essential to the invention. It is possible that the wing may be made with a greater or lesser number of cells depending in part upon the wing's span/chord ratio.</p>
<p id="P-00061" num="00061">The wing can be broadly divided into three sections in its spanwise direction. These are the center section <b>20</b> constituting approximately six cells through the center of the span, and the two outside or side sections <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> which are comprised of seven cells each. These 'sections' are clearly illustrated in FIG. <b>2</b>. It is to be understood that these figures are based on the current embodiment, which is a nineteen rib wing, and are not critical to the invention.</p>
<p id="P-00062" num="00062">Each of the cells through the mid span section <b>20</b> of the wing envelope has an opening <b>6</b> positioned just to the lower skin <b>2</b> side of leading edge <b>4</b>. These openings <b>6</b> allow air travelling over the kite's leading edge <b>4</b> to enter and inflate the cells. This is known in the art as the ram air system of inflation.</p>
<p id="P-00063" num="00063">Each rib <b>3</b> is provided with an opening or porous section <b>13</b> which allows air to pass from the cells that have openings <b>6</b> to cells without openings <b>6</b>. In this way the entire wing envelope becomes inflated. The openings <b>13</b> also allow pressure equalisation throughout the interior of the wing envelope.</p>
<p id="P-00064" num="00064">While in the current embodiment, each of the six center span <b>20</b> cells is shown as having an opening <b>6</b> it is more usual to space these openings at, for example, every second cell. Openings <b>6</b> are not fitted to those cells that are close to the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> to reduce water ingress during relaunching from water surfaces. While in this current embodiment it is also shown that all of the openings <b>6</b> are just to the lower skin <b>2</b> side of the leading edge <b>4</b> it is also more usual to space some of these openings also in the lower skin <b>2</b>, a little further from the leading edge <b>4</b> while retaining others in positions as shown so as to better capture optimum stagnation pressure for ram air inflation when the wing is operating at varying angle of incidence.</p>
<p id="P-00065" num="00065">When the wing is inflated it assumes aerofoil profile forms in the chordwise plane perpendicular to the upper and lower skins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. This aerofoil profile enables the wing to generate lift when air flows passed it in the chordwise direction. In prior art ram air system parapents, parachutes and parafoil type traction kites the aerofoil profile is predominantly determined by a combination of the rib profiles and the positions of and relative lengths of bridles attached to the lower skin.</p>
<p id="P-00066" num="00066">In this invention, a ram air inflated wing with line attachment or bridling only at or near to the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, the chordwise aerofoil form is primarily determined by the shape of the upper and lower skins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. While the rib <b>3</b> shapes do have some effect on the aerofoil profiles their primary function is to maintain the desired spacing between the upper and lower skins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> at each point rather than controlling the camber of the aerofoils in the chordwise sense. Attempting to effect the chordwise aerofoil form of the wing by changing only the camber of the ribs <b>3</b> will, unless the shape of the upper and lower skins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> is also adjusted, most likely just cause drag inducing wrinkles without having much effect on the overall shape.</p>
<p id="P-00067" num="00067">As discussed earlier, the upper and lower skins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are constructed of individual panels. One of these individual panels <b>1</b><i>j </i>is shown in FIG. <b>6</b>. The chordwise and spanwise shape of the upper and lower skins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, and therefore the aerofoil profile of the wing at each cell, is largely determined by the shape to which each individual panel, <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>1</b><i>c</i>, <b>1</b><i>d</i>, . . . <b>1</b><i>j </i>. . . etc, is cut. The way in which the shape of these individual panels effects the wing shape will be discussed in detail later.</p>
<p id="P-00068" num="00068">Each opening <b>6</b> is provided with a valve <b>11</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which allows air to enter the wing but resists air escaping from an inflated or partially inflated wing. There are a number of methods known in the art for providing such valves. The current invention uses a fabric sleeve or tube <b>11</b> through which ram air entering opening <b>6</b> can pass but which collapses, sealing opening <b>6</b>, when the pressure within the cell is greater than the pressure at opening <b>6</b>. Further, each of these tubes <b>11</b> are provided with a restraining cord <b>12</b> which prevents the tube turning inside out and extruding out through opening <b>6</b> when the internal pressure within the wing greatly exceeds the pressure at opening <b>6</b>, for example, during a high impact crash.</p>
<p id="P-00069" num="00069">The above arrangement has several advantages including allowing the wing to be partially or fully inflated before launching is attempted. This is achieved by inserting the output nozzle of a high volume low pressure pump such as a reversed portable vacuum cleaner through one of the openings <b>6</b> and valves <b>11</b>. Pre-inflating the wing in this way is particularly advantageous in that it allows full powered fully controlled flying as soon as the wing is launched rather than the operator having to sustain the wing while it inflates by ram air and while power and control may be less than 100%. Whether or not pre-inflation is applied, maintenance of internal pressure during flight against any leakage is by ram air.</p>
<p id="P-00070" num="00070">A further advantage of using non-return valves <b>11</b> on the openings <b>6</b> is that the wing will float when landed on water and will not deflate to the extent that relaunching becomes impossible even after a considerable period. By designing the tubular valves <b>11</b> to have significant length in proportion to the average chord dimension of the wing and restraining them with cords <b>12</b> loosely to the top skin the possibility of water ingress through the openings <b>6</b> is much reduced, even when the wing is orientated leading edge <b>4</b> down on choppy water.</p>
<p id="P-00071" num="00071">Valves <b>11</b> also substantially prevent deflation of the wing during short periods of very light wind that are sometimes experienced during stalls and backward flying. Backward flying is a frequently used flying mode for four line versions of the wing.</p>
<p id="P-00072" num="00072">To deflate the wing after use an open ended stiff tube or pipe may be passed through one of the openings <b>6</b> and valve <b>11</b>. This provides an air passage through the valve <b>11</b> while deflation proceeds.</p>
<p id="P-00073" num="00073">While the preferred embodiment of the wing has a closed leading edge, with inflation through openings <b>6</b> and valves <b>11</b> this is not essential to the invention. It is possible for the wing to be made with just one elongate opening along its leading edge <b>4</b> or with a series of spaced openings distributed spanwise along the leading edge <b>4</b> or with an elongate opening or openings that are covered with fine mesh. Such an arrangement is similar to the Flexifoil kite that is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,363,458. These alternative embodiments are likely to be used on smaller wings for use in nontraction activities such as recreational kite flying and particularly for use by novice fliers who may be more likely to cause high impact crashes that can burst or tear such inflated envelope type kites if there are no openings that will permit the rapid egress of air when internal pressure elevates suddenly. Also, extended non valved openings allow rapid inflation in low apparent winds without the necessity and inconvenience of having access to pumping equipment. This can make launching easier for novices.</p>
<p id="P-00074" num="00074">One uniqueness of the wing of the current invention is that it contains no rigid or semi-rigid spar or frame members and no bridling through the center span of the wing. In some embodiments of this invention, both two-line and four-line, the flying lines are attached directly to the wing at or very near the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. If some bridling system is used the bridle lines are attached to the wing only at or near to the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00075" num="00075">By the methods that have been applied and features or combinations of features that have been used when attempting to design such wings prior to this invention, such a wing would not be useable in a practicable way for the purposes of traction or recreational kite flying or would at least be of significantly worse performance than the wing of this invention.</p>
<p id="P-00076" num="00076">The current invention has a number of features which enable the wing to maintain its approximately semicircular shape while flying without either lines or bridling other than at or near the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, or any rigid or semi-rigid frame members.</p>
<p id="P-00077" num="00077">In order to maintain balance and controllability so that the wing flies correctly, the shape of the wing, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, should be such that the center of pressure of the aerofoil of the wing when it is flying, at every point spanwise, falls on or close to a line A connecting the tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. This line A is the &#x201c;Pivot line&#x201d; of the wing. This pivot line A does not necessarily pass through the points defined by the intersection of the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> and the leading edge <b>4</b> of the kite.</p>
<p id="P-00078" num="00078">If the center of pressure of any cell is not on or near Pivot line A then there will be a tendency for the resulting moment of the aerodynamic forces acting on that cell, at a distance from the pivot line A, to either increase or decrease the angle of incidence of that cell. If this moment is sufficiently great and/or if the aerofoil profile of the wing at that point is not sufficiently auto-stable with respect to the characteristics of movement of its center of pressure point with changing angle of incidence then there will be a tendency for the wing to destabilise at that cell. If the destabilisation at the cell is extreme or effects a significant spanwise section of the wing it could destabilise the entire wing.</p>
<p id="P-00079" num="00079">The above pivot line effect will now be described in detail. If a central span <b>20</b> cell was so placed relative to the pivot line A that its aerofoil's center of pressure at the angle of incidence applying to during normal flying of the wing was significantly forward of the pivot line A then that cell would tend towards increasing its angle of incidence relative to that of the wing generally. If this effect was strong enough, or applied to a number of adjacent cells, then the angle of incidence of the entire wing could be also caused to increase, in some cases to the point of stalling which would cause the wing to stop flying. Conversely, if the cell in the above example was so positioned as to have its center of pressure behind the pivot line A then its angle of attack would tend to decrease causing the wing to luff. If this effect was strong enough, or less strong but effecting a number of cells in an adjacent area, the resulting destabilisation often causes kites to crash.</p>
<p id="P-00080" num="00080">If a cell near wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, i.e. in outer span sections <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, is so placed that its aerofoils center of pressure for the angle of incidence of the wing tip in normal flying is significantly to the leading edge <b>4</b> side of the pivot line A then that cell's relative angle of attack will tend to increase. If the moment about the pivot line A of its aerodynamic forces is sufficient, or if a number of adjacent cells are also similarly misplaced relative to the pivot line A and/or if this increase in the cell or cells angle of incidence moves the cell(s) center of pressure point(s) outside the range in which they are self correcting, the wing tip may stall. This causes, at least, the lift to drag ratio for the wing to fall below that which is desirable for traction kites, or in the worst, case stall the entire wing or cause it to become uncontrollable.</p>
<p id="P-00081" num="00081">If the above wing tip cell center of pressure is to the trailing edge <b>5</b> side of the pivot line A then by similar mechanisms the wing tip may be caused to luff which has the effect of collapsing the wing. This form of destabilisation can be dangerous for the operator and is very difficult to recover from.</p>
<p id="P-00082" num="00082">The aerofoil profile of a typical center span <b>20</b> rib <b>3</b> can and should preferably tend towards being a standard form of aerofoil optimised for maximum lift as measured by lift coefficient and for maximum efficiency, that is lift to drag ratio, rather than a fully reflexive section as is used and is necessary for the proper functioning of Flexifoil style kites as described under U.S. Pat. No. 4,363,458. Although it is possible to use a fully reflexive aerofoil profile section in this center span <b>20</b> area such profiles do not usually have either lift coefficients or lift to drag ratios as good as more conventional aerofoils. Fully reflexive aerofoils do not have good efficiency, as measured by lift to drag ratio, when they are caused to fly at higher angles of incidence and also tend to exhibit undesirable stall characteristics because they do not retain airflow over their top surface well at higher angles of incidence.</p>
<p id="P-00083" num="00083">It is one characteristic of this invention that center span <b>20</b> aerofoil form can be substantially optimised for power and efficiency even while the wing as a whole retains desirable flying characteristics especially in the sense of being resistant to luffing. Notwithstanding the above, traction kites designed according to the principles of this invention may use center span <b>20</b> aerofoil forms employing fairly flat rather than significantly convex form over the rear half of their upper surface <b>1</b> and somewhat convex lower surfaces <b>2</b>. This is because such forms, while tending towards the reflexive, can still have very acceptable lift coefficients and lift to drag ratio while also having especially good luff resistance which is desirable for those traction kites that are used in turbulent winds and for extreme manoeuvres. The relative advantages, and design criteria, of various aerofoil profiles will be apparent to the skilled addressee so only some aspects of these will be discussed further.</p>
<p id="P-00084" num="00084">If a standard form of aerofoil profile optimised for lift coefficient and lift/drag ratio, as described above, is used for the tip sections <b>21</b> and <b>20</b> of a ram air inflated wing without rigid or semi-rigid framing or bridling distributed across the span then the wing will not consistently hold its approximately semi-circular shape because the tip <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> sections will collapse inwards. This will happen whenever the angle of incidence of the tip sections becomes significantly negative which will occur when turning is attempted or with fluctuations in the direction of the apparent wind that occur naturally in even mildly turbulent wind. The relationship between angle of incidence and center of pressure for such conventional aerofoil forms is such that the foils do not respond to changes in their angle of incidence in such a way as to preserve a positive angle of incidence as the angle of incidence approaches zero degrees from having been positive.</p>
<p id="P-00085" num="00085">It is possible to minimise the opportunities for inward collapse of the wing tip sections on a wing while using non-reflexive aerofoil profiles at the tips. This is achieved by constructing and rigging the wing so that the tips have a high positive angle of incidence of say 15 degrees or more in standard flying trim. The drag price of such a solution is such as to reduce the performance of the wing to an undesirable extent.</p>
<p id="P-00086" num="00086">Even with such high inherent wing tip angle of incidence as, say, 15 degrees there will be occasions during which the apparent wind direction will change sufficiently to cause collapse. To overcome this problem, an aerofoil profile that is auto stable with respect to changes in angle of incidence down to lower and even into negative angles is introduced near wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. Reflexive profile aerofoils can have such auto stable characteristics so, for example, could be introduced progressively in the outer one third of each end of the wing span and should be strongly reflexive in the last few cells near each wing tip <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. In the current embodiment, which has twenty cells, the last four, near the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> are strongly reflexive. As the cells progress in towards center span <b>20</b> of the wing the aerofoil profiles become less reflexive.</p>
<p id="P-00087" num="00087">An example of a reflexive profile aerofoil is shown in FIG. <b>5</b>. It's center of pressure C, the point at which all the aerodynamic forces can be thought of as acting through, is close to the leading edge <b>4</b> where it would approximately be for angles of incidence in the zero to +5 degree range. Reflexive aerofoils are of a class of aerofoils that to a greater or lesser extent are auto stable in response to changes in their angle of incidence provided that they are sufficiently free from external mechanical constraints to allow self adjustment to occur. With respect to their use in the wing which is the subject of this invention auto-stable means that when, the angle of the apparent wind changes by a few degrees either way, the aerofoil will respond by rotating in such a way as restore the angle of incidence of the aerofoil to the apparent wind striking it back to approximately what it was before the initial change.</p>
<p id="P-00088" num="00088">The characteristic by which reflexive aerofoils are auto-stable is that when their angle of incidence is increased their center of pressure responds by moving towards the trailing edge, and when their angle of incidence is decreased their center of pressure moves forward. Many aerofoil forms exhibit this characteristic in the range of angles of incidence from +5 degrees upwards but are not auto-stable below about 5 degrees at which angle, unless constrained, they can collapse into a catastrophic self generating luff. Reflexive aerofoils can be auto-stable in a wider range of angle of incidence, for example, in the range from &#x2212;5 degrees to +5 degrees which is critical for this invention.</p>
<p id="P-00089" num="00089">In the example of a reflexive aerofoil illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the center of pressure C is close to leading edge <b>4</b>, which is about where it would be for angles of incidence in the zero to +5 degree range. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that the center of pressure, marked by point C at rib <b>15</b>, is just forward of the pivot line A. The wing of the invention will hold its form during flight satisfactorily if the pivot line A passes through a point, at each cell, within the range in which the center of pressure of the aerofoil profile of that cell is auto-stable. In fact, because the fully inflated envelope that forms the wing has some appreciable torsional rigidity in relation to the aerodynamic forces operating on any individual cell some minor deviations from the above pivot line principle are possible without deleteriously effecting the functioning of the wing in an overall sense.</p>
<p id="P-00090" num="00090">Some deviation can be desirable for various subsidiary reasons. One reason is the positioning of cells towards the wing tips a little forward of their optimum position so that their angle of incidence, measured in a flow wise plane normal to the lower skin <b>2</b> tends to be greater than that of the more central cells measured ditto. The effect of this is to further reduce the risk of wing tip collapses during sudden changes of apparent wind direction. The minor cost for this is a little more overall drag which is, in any case, somewhat offset by the increased span and hence projected area of the wing overall which derives from the tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> having a greater outward tendency. The overall pull from the wing will therefore be slightly increased while the lift to drag ratio will be only marginally decreased provided that angle of incidence increase at the tips is not extreme. The use of this deviation from the strict application of the pivot line rule is denoted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by indicating a &#x201c;nominal&#x201d; center of pressure point for it from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as being just forward of, rather than exactly on, the pivot line A.</p>
<p id="P-00091" num="00091">Although, as suggested above, the inflated envelope of the wing which is the subject of this invention has appreciable torsional rigidity this is more true towards the center span area where each cell is constrained from either side, while being less true towards the tips which can therefore pivot freely enough to allow the auto stable aerofoils used in the wing tip area to self adjust.</p>
<p id="P-00092" num="00092">Another feature of this embodiment of the invention is the smoothness of the upper leading edge <b>4</b> area through the center span <b>20</b> of the wing. Attaining smoothness in this area is particularly important to reduce drag and to assist in the retention of attached flow over the top surface of the wing to higher angles of incidence than is possible if this area were less smooth. This results in a desirable reduction in the wing's tendency to stall which can be used to increase the pull from the wing without increasing its size.</p>
<p id="P-00093" num="00093">Improved smoothness in this most critical area is accomplished be causing proportionally more of the spanwise loads carried in the skins to be taken through the upper leading edge <b>4</b> area, and this in turn is accomplished by adjusting the cut of the panels, for example <b>1</b><i>j</i>, that make up the upper skin surface <b>1</b> through the center <b>20</b> of the span. An example of how this is accomplished is shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> which illustrates panel <b>1</b><i>j</i>. Panel <b>1</b><i>j </i>is cut to be narrower near leading edge <b>4</b>, shown by the dashed line <b>23</b>, than it would be if the objective had been to distribute the spanwise skin loads more evenly in a chordwise sense. In this case it would have been cut to the shape shown by the solid lines. In the embodiment shown, the upper skin panels near the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> are not cut similarly to panel <b>1</b><i>j </i>because in this area such tightening of the upper leading edge <b>4</b> increases the risk that the tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> will collapse inwards during flight.</p>
<p id="P-00094" num="00094">Another advantageous feature of this embodiment of the invention is the shaping of the wing tip <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> lower skin <b>2</b> areas to assume convex form, when viewed from the operator's side of the wing even before full inflation is accomplished. Until the wing tip sections <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> fully inflate into reflexive aerofoil forms there is little to resist the inwards force applied to the tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> by the spanwise component of flying line <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> tension and by occasional changes in apparent wind that tend to force the tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> inwards. Therefore, before inflation is complete, the wing has an undesirable tendency to collapse. Shaping the lower skin <b>2</b> in the wing tip areas <b>21</b><b>22</b> into convex form causes the wing tips areas <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> to be quite resistant to collapsing inwards even before full inflation is accomplished. This is because such convex forms generate outward aerodynamic forces.</p>
<p id="P-00095" num="00095">In addition to shaping the lower skin <b>2</b> to have this form it is also desirable that the flying line <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> loads are carried into the wing envelope primarily by way of the lower skin <b>2</b> rather than by the upper skin <b>1</b> at the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. The transferred flying line load tensions the lower skin <b>2</b> in the wing tip areas into the desirable convex shape they have been cut to. If the flying line tension was transferred into the wing envelope by way of the upper skin <b>1</b>, which is cut to form the upper part of reflexive aerofoil profile in wing tip areas <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> when fully inflated, the tip areas <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> present a concave form aerofoil until inflation is complete. This could cause the tips to collapse inwards at the slightest provocation.</p>
<p id="P-00096" num="00096">An example of how the lower skin <b>2</b> is cut so as to assume a convex shape in the wing tip areas <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> is shown in FIG. <b>7</b>. Panel <b>2</b><i>a </i>is cut to be wide at the leading edge <b>4</b>, narrower in the central chord area and wider again at the trailing edge <b>5</b>. In this embodiment all the lower skin panels in the tip areas <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are cut in this way to some extent, with the amount of narrowing being greater for panels towards the tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> and less in panels nearer to the center section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00097" num="00097">An example of how the flying line <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> loads are transferred into the envelope of the wing primarily through the lower skin <b>2</b> in the tip areas <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. Reinforced strips, <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> in the case of the two line embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8 and 34</figref>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>37</b> in the case of the four line embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, are attached to the lower skin <b>2</b> in the pattern depicted in the respective Figures. To further ensure that the flying line loads transfer primarily to the lower skin <b>2</b>, the two upper skin panels nearest to the wing tip <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> are cut more full at their leading edge <b>4</b> and trailing edge <b>5</b> ends. This extra fullness, while not distorting the aerofoil form of the end cells to any unacceptable degree, ensures that tension loads can not pass from where the flying lines or bridles are attached to the wing at the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> directly into the upper skin <b>1</b>. The tension loads must pass first into the lower skin <b>2</b> and then gradually cell by cell into the upper skin <b>1</b> around the leading edge <b>4</b>, the trailing edge <b>5</b> and by way of the ribs <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00098" num="00098">A further feature of this embodiment of the invention is that the upper and lower skin panels nearest the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> are cut so that their leading edges <b>4</b> are longer by about 5% than they would be if their aerodynamic profile was the only criteria used in determining their shape. This is done to prevent the front flying lines <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> loads, where they enter the envelope at the wing tips, from transferring into the center span <b>20</b> of the wing, where the majority part of the kite's pull is generated, by way of the leading edge <b>4</b> and particularly by way of the upper leading edge area <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> at the tips. See FIG. <b>13</b>. Tension loads transmitted from the center span area <b>20</b> must be turned through approximately 90 degrees before they can be resisted by the flying line loads and this change of direction has an inward component in the shoulder areas <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> which if taken through the leading edge in the four or five cells nearest to each tip <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> can cause the leading edge sections in this area to pull inwards which can initiate wing tip and hence wing collapse. It is therefore an object of the design and shaping of the panels in the wing tip areas <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and the positioning of the reinforcements <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> that transmit the flying line loads into the wing envelope to keep spanwise tension loads away from the leading edges in the wing tip areas as much as possible without unacceptable distortion of the aerofoil profiles in these areas.</p>
<p id="P-00099" num="00099">A further feature of this embodiment of the invention is the variation in leading edge <b>4</b> shapes of the upper skin <b>1</b> and the lower skin <b>2</b> when each is separately laid out flat prior to incorporation in the wing. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in particular, the top skin <b>1</b> has significantly more sweep back towards the tips than the lower skin <b>2</b>, which is shown by the dashed line. When assembled with ribs and joined at the trailing and leading edges <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> to form the wing envelope, there will then be some residual built in twist which has the effect of providing positive angle of incidence at each tip <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> relative to the centre span <b>20</b> of the wing. This is of great benefit in preventing inward collapse of the tips in stalled and low apparent wind speed conditions before the aerodynamic forces generated by wing tip profile reflexivity become more efficient in this task.</p>
<p id="P-00100" num="00100">A further feature of this embodiment of the invention is that the panels that make up the lower skin <b>2</b> in the center chord area are cut a little wider than they normally would be to match the semicircular form the wing assumes when flying. Conversely the panels that make up the upper skin <b>1</b> are cut a little narrower in their central chord areas. The effect is that when the kite is unloaded the wing envelope will tend to flatten, or open, out from its flying shape which is advantageous in terms of readying the kite for relaunching during which any tendency for the wing to roll up rather than open out can cause difficulties.</p>
<p id="P-00101" num="00101">The choice between two and four line embodiments of this invention is predominantly one of desired characteristic. Two line wings have less lines to tangle while launching and during flying and the lower line drag from just two flying lines results in either better upwind performance or the choice of using longer lines for the same upwind performance relative to four line embodiments. Four line embodiments have quicker steering and a measure of almost instantaneous power control by using the rear lines to change the wing's angle of attack and hence its pull. If designed with sufficiently wide wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> relative to the chord at center span they can also be launched and flown backwards which is an advantage in many situations. With this wider tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> the applying of load to the rear lines, commonly called the brakes, by manipulation of the operators handles or bar can cause the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> to assume a chordwise cambered or concave form. At some intermediate state between no brake line tension and enough brake tension to stall the wing, this chordwise camber may cause the tips to luff collapsing the wing. There are a number of ways to prevent this undesirable characteristic.</p>
<p id="P-00102" num="00102">One method is to cut the wing tip panels so that the cells adjacent to the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> are sufficiently large in cross section that when there is full inflation the end cells have adequate bending strength to resist this cambering tendency. Another method is to fit a rigid or semi-rigid batten chordwise or diagonally to each wing tip or near to each wing tip <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. A further method is to fit a sealed bladder to each of the wing tip cells that can be pump inflated to pressure greater than available from ram air inflation. This solution has the advantages of not increasing the dimensions of the kite when packed away and also of providing some residual flotation in the case that the wing becomes totally deflated while in the water through damage or other cause. A final method is to support the tip along its chord with multiple bridle lines that converge to the flying lines at some distance from the tip sufficient that the chordwise components of the loads in these bridles are insufficient to compressively buckle the wing tip even in the absence of battens, bladders or full inflation.</p>
<p id="P-00103" num="00103">A number of suitable bridles for tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> are known in the art. It is of course possible, for the flying lines of a two line wing or for the front lines only of a four line wing, to use a conventional fixed leg multiple bridle attached in various places along the wing tips <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> and converging to the respective flying lines <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> at some distance down from the wing. A disadvantage of this system is that it limits the capacity of the wing to modify its angle of incidence by rotating around a point close to the wing itself with the consequence that wings so rigged tend to suffer from an undesirable tendency to stall when flying at a low angle to the true wind direction. Two bridle systems that can be used to spread the flying line loads to the wing tips while allowing changes to the relative tension on front and brake lines for four line wings are known. One is the crown or arch bridle and the other is the cross bridle but both of these are less than perfect in preventing unwanted cambering of the wing's tips at intermediate states between full front line and full brake line load and both systems also cause the stalling characteristics as described for the fixed leg bridles above.</p>
<p id="P-00104" num="00104">A bridle arrangement suitable for two line embodiments of this invention and devised by the applicant is shown in FIG. <b>10</b>. This bridle allows the tip <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, to be supported at three spaced points <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> and <b>33</b> while behaving, incidence angle wise, as if there is but one bridle point and <b>33</b> thereby eliminating the undesirable stalling characteristics of conventional multi leg bridles. Line <b>9</b> has a ring or pulley <b>28</b> secured to it about two tip chord lengths out from the tip <b>7</b>. A line <b>29</b> is attached to the tip <b>7</b> adjacent to leading edge <b>4</b>, taken through the ring or pulley <b>28</b> and attached to tip <b>7</b> adjacent to trailing edge <b>5</b>. Ideally the path of line <b>29</b> is such as to form a continuation of edges <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> to a virtual apex at the location of the ring or pulley <b>28</b>. Because line <b>29</b> can move freely through ring or pulley <b>28</b> the bridle supports tip <b>7</b> against buckling under compressive loads but allows the wing to pivot around line <b>9</b> as though there was only a single flying line attachment point at <b>33</b>. An additional advantage of this arrangement over even single point bridles is that by adjusting the relative lengths of line <b>29</b> and the distance between ring or pulley <b>28</b> and the point <b>33</b> it is possible to tune the flying characteristics of the wing with respect to the desired degree of wing tip reflexivity and to adjust for minor lateral asymmetry's.</p>
<p id="P-00105" num="00105">A bridle suitable for four line embodiments of this invention and devised by the applicant is shown in FIG. <b>11</b>. This bridle has a line <b>32</b> attached at either end to tip <b>7</b>, or <b>8</b>. The attachment points are evenly spaced between the attachment points of flying lines <b>9</b> and <b>26</b>. A second line <b>30</b> is attached between the flying lines <b>9</b> and <b>26</b> at about four times the tip chord dimension from where the lines <b>9</b> and <b>26</b> attach to the kite. A ring or double pulley <b>31</b> connects lines <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> so that the tip <b>7</b> is supported. Because the ring or pulleys at <b>31</b> allow lines <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> to move relative to each other the operator is enabled to transfer load from entirely on the front line <b>9</b> to entirely on the brake line <b>26</b> while at every intermediate stage supporting the tip <b>7</b> evenly at the attachment points of line <b>32</b>. This support is sufficient to prevent collapse of the tip even when the wing is not fully inflated, provided that this arrangement is correctly constructed. An additional advantage of this arrangement over single point bridles is that by adjusting the length of line <b>32</b> it is possible to tune the flying characteristics of the wing with respect to the desired degree of wing tip reflexivity and to adjust for minor lateral asymmetry's.</p>
<p id="P-00106" num="00106">Notwithstanding that the wing that is the subject of this invention requires no spanwise stiffening or framing there may be occasions when it will be desirable to use a pre-inflated tube around a portion of its leading edge <b>4</b> to provide additional resistance to shoulder collapsing while launching when the wing is less than fully inflated. This is especially advantageous when launching from water as it provides some residual flotation in case of complete deflation. While it is possible that the pre-inflated tube can span the entire wing it would only be needed in the wing tip sections <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00107" num="00107">Also, notwithstanding that two, three, four, or more lines in total can be used to restrain and control the wing all of these lines may converge into as few as one flying line at some point between the operator and the kite. In the case that the operator has available other remote means such as a radio/servo mechanism for exercising control. Such an arrangement can be advantageous particularly for larger scale kite sailing applications because it allows the use of simpler winch systems for the letting out and pulling in of the kite.</p>
<p id="P-00108" num="00108">Also, the wing that is the subject of this invention may be flown in multiples or stacks as well as individually. The minimal or no bridle feature of this invention makes these wings very suitable for stacking in that successive wings can be rigged so as to be in the form of a ladder without the necessity for rigging to pass through any part of the envelope of lower wings in the stack. Stacks of kites have greater propensity to tangle during launching and at other times than individual kites but changing the number of kites in the stack is a very convenient means of adjusting total line pull for different wing strength. For users there can also be cost benefits in doing this as less total investment in kites will be required to cover a given wind range. Also, a stack of smaller kites will have advantageously sharper turning than just one larger kite for the same total pull.</p>
<p id="P-00109" num="00109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a flow wise view of the wing. It illustrates the required wing shape on side G, and the leading edge distortion which initiates inwards collapse <b>42</b> on side H. The flying line load is indicated by <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> and the aerodynamic forces on the wing by <b>45</b>. The wing collapse is initiated by transfer of lift forces from the center span <b>20</b> to the flying line by way of the leading edge <b>4</b>, exacerbated by stalled flying.</p>
<p id="P-00110" num="00110">By a combination of constructional features described above the applicant has been able to produce a ram air inflated flying wing without any bridling through the span of the wing or any frame or stiffening to maintain the spanwise form of the wing when flying. The wing so constructed is entirely self supporting and eminently useable by controllability power and efficiency for kite traction, recreational kite flying and other purposes. To the best knowledge of the applicant this has not been previously achieved even although some of the constructional features described above are known in the art.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">A steering wheel of the present invention has an airbag-apparatus. The airbag apparatus has a pad for covering the airbag, and the pad has a plurality of doors that can open. Each door opens around a hinge as a rotation center. The hinge is located below an outer periphery of the pad. That is, an area of the door itself can widely be secured, and the door can open as wide as possible. A switch operating portion is disposed in an area other than the door, but of a boss or a spoke that is not covered with the door when it opens. When doors open around the hinge as the rotation center, the doors are disposed in the three spaces between the spokes. The opened doors are disposed smoothly in the three spaces between the three spokes without interference with the switch operating portion. A widely opening state of each door can stably be secure.</p>

<p id="P-00003" num="00003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">The present invention relates to a steering wheel for a vehicle having an airbag apparatus. More particularly, the invention relates to a steering wheel having an airbag apparatus and in which switch operating portion of a function part is disposed. Examples of the function part are drive monitor switch, constant-speed running apparatus, audio equipment, air conditioner equipment, navigation system, telephone, shift change and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Conventionally, a steering wheel having an airbag apparatus is know in Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No.100907/1998 and No.11246/1999. The airbag apparatus comprises an airbag, an inflator, a pad and a bag holder. The airbag is folded such that the airbag can expand. The inflator supplies expansion gas to the airbag. The pad covers the folded airbag. The bag holder holds the airbag, the inflator and the pad, and is connected to a steering wheel body.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">The pad includes a door that is pushed by the expanding airbag and opened. The door is provided at its periphery with a to-be ruptured portion, and is provided at its portion of an outer periphery with a hinge. The door is pushed when the airbag expands to rupture the to be ruptured portion, and opens around the hinge as a rotation center.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">In these days, it is increasingly required to dispose switch operating portions for the function part that are drive monitor switch, constant-speed running apparatus, audio equipment, air conditioner equipment, navigation system, telephone, shift change and the like on the pad of the boss or the spokes near the boss. These switch operating portions are constituted such that they can be operated from above. That is, the switch operating portion comprised operation button or operation lever operated by being pushed downward or swung. In order to facilitate the operation of the switch operating portion, the switch operating portion is disposed upward such that its operating surface approaches a ring surface. The ring surface is the plane formed by an upper surface of a ring when the steering wheel is viewed from a direction perpendicular to a steering shaft.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">However, when the airbag is developed and expanded when a driver is close to the steering wheel, it is necessary that the airbag does not apply a partial pushing force to the driver. For this purpose, it is preferable to develop the airbag widely at initial stage of expansion and to inflate the airbag toward the driver. At that time, if the door of the pad interferes with the switch operating portion uselessly, the door can not open widely. That is, the airbag at its initial expanding stage can not be developed widely.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">In the present specification, the upper-lower, front-rear and right-left directions are based on the steering shaft when the steering wheel is mounted to the vehicle unless otherwise stated. That is, the upper-lower direction in the present specification is a vertical direction along the axial direction of the steering shaft. The front-rear direction in the present specification is the front and rear direction (a longitudinal direction) of the vehicle along a direction perpendicular to the axis of the steering shaft when the steering wheel is steered straightly.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1068" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">The present invention solves the above problems. That is, the present invention provides a steering wheel having an airbag apparatus capable of widely open a door of a pad even if a switch operating portion is disposed.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">A first steering wheel having an airbag apparatus of the present invention has the following structure. That is, the steering wheel comprises a ring grasped at the time of steering, a boss disposed on a center of the ring, three spokes for connecting the ring and the boss, and a space between the spokes. The steering wheel also includes, as constituent parts, a steering wheel body, the airbag apparatus disposed on the boss, and a switch operating portion that can be operated from above. The switch operating portion is disposed at least one of the boss and the spoke. The airbag apparatus comprises an airbag folded such that the airbag can expand, an inflator for supplying expansion gas to the airbag, a pad for covering the folded airbag. Further the airbag apparatus comprises a bag holder connected to the steering wheel body for holding the folded airbag, the inflator and the pad. The pad includes three doors such that one opening through which the airbag projects can be formed in a center of the pad. Each of the doors is provided at its periphery with to-be ruptured portion. And hinges are disposed on the periphery side of each of the doors. The door is pushed by the airbag when it is expanded and the to-be ruptured portion is ruptured, the door opens around a hinge disposed on the side of an outer periphery of the pad as a rotation center. A pad is held against the bag holder in the proximity to the hinge of each of the doors. The hinge of each of the doors is disposed at a position near the space between the spokes, and on the side of an outer periphery of the pad that is lower than an portion above a holding portion by the bag holder near the hinge. Each of the doors is disposed in the three spaces between the spokes when the door opens around the hinge as a rotation center. The switch operating portion is disposed on an area other than the doors and on the boss or the spoke that is not covered with the door when it opens.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">According to the first steering wheel of the present invention, if the airbag is expanded to push the three doors of the pad, each of the doors of the pad ruptures the to-be ruptured portion there around and opens around the hinge as the rotation center.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">At that time, the hinge of each door is disposed at a position near the space between the spokes and at the side of the outer periphery of the pad lower than a portion above the holding portion by the bag holder near the hinge. Thus, the door opens around the hinge as the rotation center at a position lower than the outer periphery of the pad. That is, the door can secure the wide area of its own and can open as wide as possible.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">If the hinge of the door is disposed above the holding portion by the bag holder, the area of the door itself becomes narrow. Thus, the door can not open widely.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Further, the switch operating portion is disposed in an area other than the doors, but of a boss or a spoke that is not covered with the doors when they open. When doors open around the hinge as the rotation center, the doors are arranged so as to be disposed in the three spaces between the spokes. The opened doors are disposed smoothly in the three spaces between the three spokes without interference with the switch operating portion. A widely opening state of each door can stably be secure.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">Therefore, according to the first steering wheel having the airbag apparatus of the present invention, even if the switch operating portion is disposed in an area of the boss or the spoke, the doors of the pad can widely open. Thus, in the first steering wheel, the initial expanding airbag can widely develop.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">It is preferable that the to-be ruptured portion at a portion of the adjacent doors is substantially T-shape as viewed from above. That is, the to-be ruptured portion has a lateral line portion disposed in the right-left direction and a longitudinal line portion extending rearward from a substantially central portion of the lateral line portion. The left and right opposite ends of the lateral line portion are directed to disposition directions of the front left and right spokes of the spokes, and a rear end of the longitudinal line portion is directed to a disposition direction of the rear spoke in the spoke. With this steering wheel, the following working effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">That is, in the three spokes type steering wheel, the front space is set greater than rear left and right spaces so that the measuring instruments of the instrument panel can easily be seen. Therefore, if the to-be ruptured portions adjacent to the doors are substantially T in shape, the front door in front of the lateral line portion of the to-be ruptured portion has a greater area. The left and right doors divided by the rear longitudinal line portion that is behind the lateral line portion have a smaller area. As a result, shapes of the front, left and right doors can easily be fit to the front, left and right spaces in which the doors are accommodated when they opens. That is, the shapes of the front, left and right doors can easily be set.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">Further, the pad may be provided with the following ceiling wall and side wall. The ceiling wall is disposed on an upper portion of the pad and has the doors and the to-be ruptured portion. The side wall extends downward from the ceiling wall and is disposed in the vertical direction such that the side wall can be connected to the bag holder. A remaining portion of the to-be ruptured portion except adjacent portions which adjoin the doors is disposed close to an inner surface of the side wall of the ceiling wall and substantially along the side wall. With this pad, the following working effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">That is, the side wall of the pad increases the thickness of the ceiling wall. Then the remaining portion of the to-be ruptured portion except adjacent portions of the doors approaches the inner surface of the side wall portion which increases the thickness of the ceiling wall. Therefore, stress concentration is prone to be generated in the remaining portions. Further, the remaining portions are disposed along the general portion of the side wall. Therefore, the remaining portions rupture easily along the general portion. As a result, the to-be ruptured portion easily ruptures and the doors smoothly open.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">Further, it is preferable that three clots when the airbag is folded are disposed below the front, left and right doors. With this structure, when the airbag is developed and expanded, the front, left and right doors are reliably pushed by the folded portions disposed below, and the airbag can smoothly open.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">A second steering wheel having an airbag apparatus of the present invention has the following structure. That is, the steering wheel comprises a ring grasped at the time of steering, a boss disposed on a center of the ring, and a spoke for connecting the ring and the boss. The airbag apparatus is disposed on an upper portion of the boss. The airbag apparatus comprises an airbag that is folded such that it can be expanded, and a pad for covering the folded airbag. The pad includes a door that is pushed and opened by the expanding airbag. A switch operating portion is disposed below the door when it is opened. The switch operating portion is disposed in a non-limited region where an opening-completion state of the door is not limited for the door that has completed its opening operation.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">According to the second steering wheel of the invention, if the airbag is expanded to push the door of the pad, the door opens, and the airbag projects from the pad. At that time, the switch operating portion is disposed in the non-limited region where the opening-completion state of the door is not limited to the door when it has been opened. Thus, the door can complete its opening in a widely opened state without limited by the switch operating portion.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">Thus, according to the second steering wheel having the airbag apparatus of the present invention, even if the switch operating portion is disposed below the pad door when the door opens, the pad door can be opened widely. Thus, in the second steering wheel, the airbag in its initial expanding state can be widely developed.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">This second invention is not limited to the three spoke type steering wheel, and the invention can also be applied to two or four spoke type steering wheel. The number of the doors of the pad is not limited to three, and one or more doors may be provided.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">In the second steering wheel, it is preferable that the switch operating portion is disposed in the non-limited region when the switch operating portion is pushed and moved by the door when it opens. With this structure, in a normal state before the door opens, the switch operating portion can be disposed near the ring surface located upper position. Thus, in the second steering wheel, even if the switch operating portion is disposed below the pad door when it opens, a widely opening state of the door can be secured, and the operability of the switch operating portion becomes excellent.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">In this case, when the switch operating portion is pushed and moved by the door, the switch operating portion may be lowered into the non-limited region.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">When the switch operating portion includes an operation button that is pushed down for operation, the switch operating portion may be constructed as follows. That is, it is preferable that when the switch operating portion is pushed and moved by the door, the switch operating portion is rotated and moved in the lateral direction that intersects with an operation direction of the operation button substantially at right angles so that the switch operating portion is moved to the non-limited region. In this case, even if the operation button that must be operated downward strongly at the time of operation is disposed on the switch operating portion, no problem is caused. This is because even if the switch operating portion is pushed down unnecessarily strongly during normal operation, the switch operating portion is not prone to move into the non-limited region. Thus the operability of the switch operating portion is stabilized.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">Of course, in the second steering wheel, the switch operating portion may previously disposed in the non-limited region of the door.</p>

In the case of this embodiment, the peripheries <b>11</b><i>g</i>, <b>11</b><i>h</i>, and <b>11</b><i>i </i>on the side of the folded end in the first stage are folded by outer roll folding. That is, the peripheries <b>11</b><i>g</i>, <b>11</b><i>h</i>, and <b>11</b><i>i </i>are wound on the side of the cloth D<b>1</b> having the opening <b>11</b><i>a</i>. The wound portion is placed on the side of the cloth D<b>2</b> opposed to the opening <b>11</b><i>a </i>and folded.</p>
<p id="P-00100" num="00100">After the folding operation of the airbag <b>11</b> has been completed, in order to prevent the crease from being restored and eliminated, the airbag <b>11</b> may be wrapped by a thin wrapping bag that can be ruptured.</p>
<p id="P-00101" num="00101">After the airbag <b>11</b> is folded, it is accommodated in the bag holder <b>50</b>.

Then, the rivets <b>54</b> are inserted into the mounting holes <b>46</b><i>b</i>, <b>47</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>b</i>, and the front, left and right holding walls <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, and <b>48</b> and the side wall <b>52</b> are fastened.</p>
<p id="P-00105" num="00105">The horn switch mechanism <b>57</b> is disposed on each of the mounting pieces <b>62</b> of the support plate <b>59</b>, and the portions of the horn switch mechanisms <b>57</b> are disposed on the lower surface of the mounting pieces <b>53</b> of the bag holder <b>50</b>. Next, the stepped bolt <b>57</b><i>d </i>is threadedly engaged with the screw hole <b>53</b><i>a</i>, thereby assembling the airbag apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00106" num="00106">The lower cover <b>8</b> is mounted to the steering wheel core <b>2</b> utilizing a screw or the like, the switch operating portion <b>66</b> is disposed and the steering wheel body <b>1</b> is assembled. The steering wheel core <b>2</b> is produced by die casting and then, the covering layer <b>7</b> is formed. The boss <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the boss core <b>4</b> is fitted around the steering shaft <b>80</b> of the vehicle, the nut <b>81</b> is threadedly engaged, and the steering wheel body <b>1</b> is mounted to the steering shaft <b>80</b>. The steering shaft <b>80</b> is inclined such that its upper end is directed upward through about 30&#xb0; with respect to the horizontal direction along the ground.</p>
<p id="P-00107" num="00107">Lead wires (not shown) extending from the horn switch mechanism <b>57</b> of the airbag apparatus <b>10</b> and the various switch operating portions <b>66</b> are connected to a connector (not shown) on the side of the steering wheel body <b>1</b>. Further, each of the abutting pieces <b>63</b> of the support plate <b>59</b> of the airbag apparatus <b>10</b> is abutted and supported against the covering layer <b>7</b> of the spokes SL, SR, and SB, and the connecting pieces <b>64</b>, <b>64</b> are abutted against the inner surface of the mounting seats <b>5</b><i>c </i>of the rear core <b>5</b><i>a</i>. Next, the mounting bolts <b>9</b> are threadedly engaged with the connecting holes <b>64</b><i>a </i>of the connecting pieces <b>64</b> from the hole <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the lower cover <b>8</b> through the mounting holes <b>5</b><i>d </i>of the mounting seats <b>5</b><i>c</i>. As a result, the steering wheel W<b>1</b> can be assembled and the steering wheel W<b>1</b> can be mounted to the steering shaft <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00108" num="00108">In the steering wheel W assembled in the above-described manner, a predetermined device is operated by pushing down or swinging the operation surfaces <b>67</b><i>a</i>, <b>68</b><i>a</i>, <b>69</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>a</i>, and <b>71</b><i>a </i>of the switch operating portions <b>66</b> (operation buttons <b>67</b>, <b>70</b>, the shift up button <b>68</b>, the shift down button <b>69</b>, and the operation lever <b>71</b>).</p>
<p id="P-00109" num="00109">If the inflator <b>13</b> is actuated, the expansion gas from the inflator <b>13</b> flows into the airbag <b>11</b>. Then, the airbag <b>11</b> expands and the folding portions <b>11</b><i>j</i>, <b>11</b><i>k</i>, and <b>11</b><i>m </i>are developed to push up the three doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> of the pad <b>14</b>. Therefore, the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> of the pad <b>14</b> rupture the to-be ruptured portion <b>33</b> and opens around the hinges <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b> as rotation centers. As a result, the opening forming portion <b>19</b> largely opens, the airbag <b>11</b> projects from the pad <b>14</b> and expands into a predetermined shape.</p>
<p id="P-00110" num="00110">When the airbag <b>11</b> is developed and expanded, the hinges <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b> of the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> are located near the spaces AF, AL, and AR between the spokes SL, SR, and SB. The hinges <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b> are disposed on the side of the lower ends <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the pad outer peripheries <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b> lower than a portion Z (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>). The portion Z is above the holding portions (front, left and right holding walls) <b>46</b>, <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> by the bag holder <b>50</b> near the hinges <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b> in the pad <b>14</b> (ceiling wall <b>15</b>). Therefore, the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> open around the hinges <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>31</b> located near the outer periphery lower ends <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the pad <b>14</b>. As a result, the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> can secure their own areas widely. The doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> secure wide opening area and open as wide as possible.</p>
<p id="P-00111" num="00111">When the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> open around the hinges <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b>, the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> are disposed in the three spaces AL, AR, and AB between the spokes SL, SR, and SB. The switch operating portions <b>66</b> are disposed in areas of the spokes SL, SR that are not covered with the opened doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b>. Therefore, the opened doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> do not interfere with the switch operating portions <b>66</b> and disposed smoothly in the three spaces AF, AL, and AR. As a result, the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> can widely open and their states can be stably secured.</p>
<p id="P-00112" num="00112">Therefore, according to the steering wheel W<b>1</b> of the first embodiment, even if the switch operating portions <b>66</b> are disposed on the spokes SL, SR near the boss B, the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> of the pad <b>14</b> can widely open. According to the steering wheel W<b>1</b> of the first embodiment, the airbag <b>11</b> at the initial expansion stage can widely develop. As a result, in a state in which the driver is close to the steering wheel W, even if the airbag <b>11</b> is developed and expanded, it is possible to prevent the airbag <b>11</b> from applying a partial pushing force to the driver.</p>
<p id="P-00113" num="00113">In the pad <b>14</b> of the first embodiment, portions of the to-be ruptured portions <b>33</b> which are respectively adjacent to the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> are of substantially T-shape as viewed from above, and have the lateral line portion <b>34</b> and the longitudinal line portion <b>35</b>. The lateral line portion <b>34</b> is disposed laterally. The longitudinal line portion <b>35</b> extends rearward from substantially central portion of the lateral line portion <b>34</b>. Left and right opposite ends <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the lateral line portion <b>34</b> are directed to the front left and right spokes SL, SR. In the steering wheel W<b>1</b> of the first embodiment of three spokes type, among the spaces AF, AL, and AR between the spokes SL, SR, and SB, the front space AF is set greater than rear left and right spaces AL, AR so that the measuring instruments of the instrument panel can easily be seen. Therefore, if the to-be ruptured portions <b>33</b> adjacent to the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are substantially T in shape, the front door <b>25</b> in front of the lateral line portion <b>34</b> of the to-be ruptured portion <b>33</b> has a greater area. The left and right doors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> divided by the rear longitudinal line portion <b>35</b> that is behind the lateral line portion <b>34</b> have smaller area. As a result, shapes of the front, left and right doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> can easily be fit to the front, left and right spaces AF, AL, and AR in which the doors are accommodated when they opened. That is, the shapes of the front, left and right doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> can easily be set.</p>
<p id="P-00114" num="00114">The pad <b>14</b> of the first embodiment has the ceiling wall <b>15</b> and the side wall <b>40</b>.

The general portions <b>41</b>L, <b>41</b>R, and <b>41</b>B of the side wall <b>40</b> are portions which increase the thickness of the ceiling wall <b>15</b>. That is, the remaining portions <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, and <b>38</b> of the to-be ruptured portion <b>33</b> approach the inner surface of the portion <b>41</b> which increases the thickness of the ceiling wall <b>15</b>. Therefore, stress concentration is prone to be generated in the remaining portions <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, and <b>38</b>. Further, the remaining portions <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, and <b>38</b> are disposed along the general portion <b>41</b> of the side wall <b>40</b>. Therefore, the remaining portions <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, and <b>38</b> rupture easily along the general portion <b>41</b>. As a result, the to-be ruptured portion <b>33</b> easily ruptures and the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> smoothly open.</p>
<p id="P-00115" num="00115">In the first embodiment, the switch operating portions <b>66</b> are disposed on the portions of the spokes SL, SR on the side of the steering wheel body <b>1</b> not on the side of the pad <b>14</b>.

<p id="P-00129" num="00129">When the steering wheel W<b>2</b> of the second embodiment is mounted to the vehicle, the airbag apparatus <b>10</b> is previously assembled like the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="P-00130" num="00130">Like the first embodiment, the airbag apparatus <b>10</b> is assembled by inserting the retainer <b>12</b> into the airbag <b>11</b>, by projecting the bolts <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>12</b> from the mounting holes <b>11</b><i>b </i>and then, by folding the airbag <b>11</b>. The airbag <b>11</b> is folded in such a manner that three folded portions <b>11</b><i>j</i>, <b>11</b><i>k</i>, and <b>11</b><i>m </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) are prepared, the folded portions <b>11</b><i>j</i>, and <b>11</b><i>k</i>, <b>11</b><i>m </i>are disposed below the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> of the pad <b>14</b>. That is, when the airbag <b>11</b> is developed and expanded, the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> can reliably receive the pushing force of the folded portions <b>11</b><i>j</i>, <b>11</b><i>k</i>, and <b>11</b><i>m. </i></p>
<p id="P-00131" num="00131">After the folding operation of the airbag <b>11</b> was completed, like the first embodiment, in order to prevent the crease from being restored and eliminated, the airbag <b>11</b> may be wrapped by a thin wrapping bag that can be ruptured.</p>
<p id="P-00132" num="00132">After the airbag <b>11</b> is folded, it is accommodated in the bag holder <b>50</b>. In this step, each bolt <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the retainer <b>12</b> projecting from the airbag <b>11</b> is inserted through the through hole <b>51</b><i>b </i>of the bag holder lateral plate <b>51</b>, and the airbag <b>11</b> is placed on the lateral plate <b>51</b> surrounded by the side wall <b>52</b>.

<p id="P-00134" num="00134">Thereafter, the pad <b>14</b> is pushed down from above such as to surround the outer peripheral surface on the side of the folded airbag <b>11</b> by the side wall <b>40</b>. Then, the retaining pawls <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the bag holder <b>50</b> are retained to the retaining portions <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>47</b><i>a</i>, and <b>48</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref> for the retaining portions <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>a</i>) of the front, left and right holding walls <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, and <b>48</b>. The mounting holes <b>46</b><i>b</i>, <b>47</b><i>b</i>, and <b>48</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref> for the mounting holes <b>46</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>b</i>) of the front, left and right holding walls <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, and <b>48</b> are aligned to the mounting holes <b>52</b><i>b </i>of the bag holder <b>50</b>. Then, the rivets <b>54</b> are inserted into the mounting holes <b>46</b><i>b</i>, <b>47</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>b</i>, and <b>52</b><i>b </i>and the front, left and right holding walls <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, and <b>48</b> and the side wall <b>52</b> are fastened.</p>
<p id="P-00135" num="00135">Then, the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is mounted to the support portion <b>65</b><i>c </i>of the support piece <b>65</b> of the support plate <b>59</b>A using the screws <b>170</b>. The horn switch mechanisms <b>57</b> are disposed on the mounting pieces <b>62</b> of the support plate <b>59</b>A, and the portions of these horn switch mechanisms <b>57</b> are disposed on the lower surfaces of the mounting pieces <b>53</b> of the bag holder <b>50</b>. Further, the stepped bolt <b>57</b><i>d </i>is threadedly engaged with the screw hole <b>53</b><i>a </i>from below the mounting pieces <b>62</b>, and the airbag apparatus <b>10</b> can be assembled.</p>
<p id="P-00136" num="00136">The lower cover <b>8</b> is mounted to the steering wheel core <b>2</b> having the covering layer <b>7</b> using a screw or the like, and the steering wheel body <b>1</b> is assembled. Then, the boss <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the boss core <b>4</b> is fitted around the steering shaft <b>80</b> of the vehicle (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and then, the steering wheel body <b>1</b> is mounted to the steering shaft <b>80</b> using the nut <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00137" num="00137">Then, lead wires (not shown) extending from the horn switch mechanism <b>57</b> of the airbag apparatus <b>10</b> and the various switch operating portions <b>167</b> are connected to a connector (not shown) on the side of the steering wheel body <b>1</b>. Further, each of the abutting piece <b>63</b> of the support plate <b>59</b> of the airbag apparatus <b>10</b> is abutted and supported against the covering layer <b>7</b> of the spokes SL, SR, and SB, and the connecting pieces <b>64</b>, <b>64</b> are abutted against the inner surface of the mounting seats <b>5</b><i>c </i>of the rear core <b>5</b><i>a</i>. Next, the mounting bolts <b>9</b> are threadedly engaged with the connecting holes <b>64</b><i>a </i>of the connecting pieces <b>64</b> from the hole <b>8</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the lower cover <b>8</b> through the mounting holes <b>5</b><i>d </i>of the mounting seats <b>5</b><i>c</i>. As a result, the steering wheel W<b>2</b> can be assembled and the steering wheel W<b>2</b> can be mounted to the steering shaft <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00138" num="00138">In the steering wheel W<b>2</b> assembled in the above-described manner, the operating surface <b>169</b><i>a </i>of each the operation button <b>169</b> of the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is pushed down, the predetermined equipment is operated.</p>
<p id="P-00139" num="00139">If the inflator <b>13</b> is actuated, the expansion gas from the inflator <b>13</b> flows into the airbag <b>11</b>. Then, the airbag <b>11</b> expands and the folding portions <b>11</b><i>j</i>, <b>11</b><i>k</i>, <b>11</b><i>m </i>are developed to push up the three doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> of the pad <b>14</b>. Therefore, the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> of the pad <b>14</b> rupture the to-be ruptured portion <b>33</b> and open around the hinges <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b> as rotation centers. As a result, the opening forming portion <b>19</b> largely opens, the airbag <b>11</b> projects from the pad <b>14</b> and expands into a predetermined shape.</p>
<p id="P-00140" num="00140">When the airbag apparatus <b>10</b> is developed and expanded like in the same manner as the first embodiment, the hinges <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b> of the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> are located near the spaces AF, AL, and AR between the spokes SL, SR, and SB, and the hinges <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b> are disposed on the side of the lower ends <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the pad outer peripheries <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b> lower than a portion Z (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>7</b>). The portion Z is above the holding portions (front, left and right holding walls) <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, and <b>48</b> held by the bag holder <b>50</b> near the hinges <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b>. Therefore, the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> open around the hinges <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b> located near the outer periphery lower ends <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the pad <b>14</b>. As a result, the doors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>27</b> can secure their own areas widely and open as wide as possible.</p>
<p id="P-00141" num="00141">When the left door <b>26</b> is opened around the hinge <b>30</b> as a rotation center, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the upper portion <b>167</b><i>a </i>of the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is pushed by the door <b>26</b>, which opens rapidly. Therefore, the to-be deformed portion <b>65</b><i>b </i>is plastically deformed, the support portion <b>65</b><i>c </i>of the support piece <b>65</b> rotates and moves around the to-be deformed portion <b>65</b><i>b </i>and is inclined toward the space AL. As a result, the switch operating portion <b>167</b> supported by the support portion <b>65</b><i>c </i>is disposed in a non-limited region or a non-interfering position. This non-limited region is a region where the switch operating portion <b>167</b> does not limit the opening completion state of the door <b>26</b>. Thus, the door <b>26</b> completes the opening operation in the widely opened state without being limited by the switch operating portion <b>167</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00142" num="00142">Therefore, according to the steering wheel W<b>2</b> having the airbag apparatus <b>10</b> in the second embodiment, even if the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is disposed below the pad opened door <b>26</b>, the door <b>26</b> of the pad <b>14</b> can widely open. Thus, the initially expanding airbag <b>11</b> can widely develop. As a result, even if the airbag <b>11</b> is developed and expanded in a state in which the driver is close to the steering wheel W<b>2</b>, it is possible to prevent the airbag <b>11</b> from applying a partial pushing force to the driver.</p>
<p id="P-00143" num="00143">In the second embodiment, the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is pushed by the opening door <b>26</b> and rotated and moved, while plastically deforming the to-be deformed portion <b>65</b><i>b</i>, and the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is disposed in the non-limited region. In the normal state before the door <b>26</b> opens, the switch operating portion <b>167</b> can be disposed such as to approach the ring surface P located at upper position. Thus, in the second embodiment, even if the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is disposed at a lower position below the pad door <b>26</b> which is opened, the door <b>26</b> can widely open, and the operability of the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is enhanced.</p>
<p id="P-00144" num="00144">If the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is designed such that it is pushed by the opening door <b>26</b> and moved and disposed in the non-limited region, the switch operating portion <b>167</b> may be constructed like a steering wheel W<b>3</b> of a third embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref> to <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00145" num="00145">In the steering wheel W<b>3</b> of the third embodiment, a mounting hole <b>65</b><i>d </i>provided on a support portion <b>65</b><i>c </i>of a support piece <b>65</b>A is made as a long hole extending vertically. The screws <b>170</b>, <b>170</b> set the fastening strength to a predetermined value. The screws <b>170</b>, <b>170</b> are threadedly engaged with a case <b>168</b> of a switch operating portion <b>167</b>. The fastening strength of the screw <b>170</b> is set to such a degree that the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is not lowered by a normal pushing down operation of the operation buttons <b>169</b> to the operating surface <b>169</b><i>a </i>(see FIGS. <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>A). The fastening strength of each of the screws <b>170</b>, <b>170</b> is set such that when the door <b>26</b> abuts against the upper portion <b>167</b><i>a </i>of the switch operating portion <b>167</b> from above, the switch operating portion <b>167</b> can be lowered along the long hole mounting hole <b>65</b><i>d </i>in a state in which the screw <b>170</b> is threaded (see FIGS. <b>25</b>B and <b>26</b>). A vertical length of the mounting hole <b>65</b><i>d </i>is set to such a degree that when the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is disposed on the upper portion, excellent operability can be secured, and when the door <b>26</b> opens, the switch operating portion <b>167</b> can be disposed in the non-limited region of the door <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00146" num="00146">With this steering wheel W<b>3</b> of the third embodiment, the same working effect as that of the second embodiment can be obtained.</p>
<p id="P-00147" num="00147">Further, a steering wheel may be constructed as a steering wheel W<b>4</b> of a fourth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27</figref> to <b>29</b>. In this steering wheel W<b>4</b>, a case <b>168</b> itself of a switch operating portion <b>167</b>A is shrunk by pushing force of the door <b>26</b>. That is, the case <b>168</b> includes a lower case <b>168</b><i>a </i>and an upper case <b>168</b><i>b</i>. The lower case <b>168</b><i>a </i>is disposed at a lower portion of the case <b>168</b>. The lower case <b>168</b><i>a </i>is mounted to the support portion <b>65</b><i>c </i>of the support piece <b>65</b>B using a screw <b>170</b>, and supported by a support portion <b>65</b><i>c</i>. The upper case <b>168</b><i>b </i>is disposed above the lower case <b>168</b><i>a</i>. The upper case <b>168</b><i>b </i>is formed at its outer periphery with a projecting position limiting portion <b>168</b><i>c</i>. With a normal operation of the operation buttons <b>169</b> for pushing down the operating surface <b>169</b><i>a</i>, the position limiting portion <b>168</b><i>c </i>limits the position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27</figref>, <b>28</b>A), and the upper case <b>168</b><i>b </i>does not move toward the lower case <b>168</b><i>a</i>. When the door <b>26</b> opens, if the door <b>26</b> abuts against the upper portion <b>167</b><i>a </i>of the switch operating portion <b>167</b>A from above, the position limiting portion <b>168</b><i>c </i>can not limit the position by this pushing force. That is, the upper case <b>168</b><i>b </i>moves into the lower case <b>168</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28B</figref>, <b>29</b>), the upper portion <b>167</b><i>a </i>of the switch operating portion <b>167</b>A is located in the non-limited region of the door <b>26</b>. With this steering wheel W<b>4</b> of the fourth embodiment, the same working effect as those of the first and second embodiments.</p>
<p id="P-00148" num="00148">Further, a steering wheel may be constructed as a steering wheel W<b>5</b> of a fifth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30</figref> to <b>32</b>. In this steering wheel W<b>5</b>, a lower end of a switch operating portion <b>167</b>B is supported on the support portion <b>65</b><i>c </i>of the support piece <b>65</b>C so that the lower end can rotate toward the space AL. A plurality of retaining pawls <b>168</b><i>d </i>extending from the case <b>168</b> is disposed on an upper portion of the switch operating portion <b>167</b>B. The retaining pawls <b>168</b><i>d </i>retain the edges <b>65</b><i>g</i>, <b>65</b><i>g </i>on the side surfaces of the support portion <b>65</b><i>c</i>. Brackets <b>65</b><i>e</i>, <b>65</b><i>e </i>holding a support shaft <b>65</b><i>f </i>are disposed on opposite sides of a lower end of the support portion <b>65</b><i>c </i>of the support piece <b>65</b>C. The switch operating portion <b>167</b>B is rotatably supported by the support shaft <b>65</b><i>f</i>. An upper portion <b>167</b><i>a </i>of the switch operating portion <b>167</b>B projects upward from the support portion <b>65</b><i>c</i>. The upper portion <b>167</b><i>a </i>of the switch operating portion <b>167</b>B is disposed near the outer side of the hinge <b>30</b> of the door <b>26</b> and above the hinge <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00149" num="00149">According to the steering wheel W<b>5</b> of the fifth embodiment, when the left door <b>26</b> opens around the hinge <b>30</b> as rotation center, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the upper portion <b>167</b><i>a </i>of the switch operating portion <b>167</b>B is pushed by the door <b>26</b> that opens rapidly. Then, the retaining pawls <b>168</b><i>d </i>come out from the supporting both edges <b>65</b><i>g</i>, <b>65</b><i>g</i>, and the switch operating portion <b>167</b>D is rotated and moved around the support shaft <b>65</b><i>f </i>as the rotation center such as to be inclined toward the space AL. As a result, the switch operating portion <b>167</b>B is disposed in the non-limited region where the opening completion state of the door <b>26</b> is not limited. Therefore, the door <b>26</b> completes the opening operation in the widely opened state without being limited by the switch operating portion <b>167</b>B.</p>
<p id="P-00150" num="00150">In this steering wheel W<b>5</b> also, the switch operating portion <b>167</b>B is pushed by the opening door <b>26</b> and moved, and disposed in the non-limited region. That is, according to this steering wheel W<b>5</b> also, in a normal state before the door <b>26</b> is opened, the switch operating portion <b>167</b>B can be disposed near the ring surface P at a upper position as close as possible. As a result, with this steering wheel W<b>5</b> also, the door <b>26</b> can open widely and the operability of the switch operating portion <b>167</b>B is excellent.</p>
<p id="P-00151" num="00151">In the steering wheels W<b>2</b> and W<b>5</b> of the second and fifth embodiments, operation direction of each operation button <b>169</b> of each switch operating portion <b>167</b>, <b>167</b>B is downward direction. When the switch operating portion <b>167</b> or <b>167</b>B is moved to the non-limited region, it is not moved downwardly. That is, when the switch operating portion <b>167</b> or <b>167</b>B is pushed by the door <b>26</b>, the switch operating portion rotated and moved in the lateral direction so as to intersect with the operation direction of the operation buttons <b>169</b> substantially at right angles, and is moved to the non-limited region of the door <b>26</b>. Therefore, even if the operation buttons <b>169</b> that must be operated strongly downward at the time of operation is disposed on the switch operating portion <b>167</b> or <b>167</b>B, the switch operating portion <b>167</b> or <b>167</b>B is less prone to move the non-limited region. As a result, in the second and fifth embodiments, the operability of the operation buttons <b>169</b> can be stabilized.</p>
<p id="P-00152" num="00152">Although the operability of the operation buttons <b>169</b> of the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is not excellent, the operating surface <b>169</b><i>a </i>may be located at a position largely lower than the ring surface P like a steering wheel W<b>6</b> shown in FIG. <b>20</b>. That is, in the steering wheel W<b>6</b>, the switch operating portion <b>167</b> is originally disposed in the non-limited region below the opened door <b>26</b>. According to this steering wheel W<b>6</b>, even if the opening operation of the door <b>26</b> has been completed, the door does not come into contact with the switch operating portion <b>167</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00153" num="00153">Further, in the second to sixth embodiments, three spoke type steering wheel W<b>2</b>, W<b>3</b>, W<b>4</b>, W<b>5</b> and W<b>6</b> are described. As the second to sixth embodiments, two or four spoke type steering wheel may be used. In the steering wheel, the number of the doors of the pad is not limited to three, and one or more doors may be provided.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e867" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The invention relates to an arrangement for securing a belt retractor on the body part of a motor vehicle, whereby the housing of the belt retractor, which is U-shaped and has side shanks and supports therein a belt shaft, comprises a fastening bracket projecting therefrom having an access opening for a securement means operable to secure the belt retractor to the body part of the motor vehicle and an additional mounting plate deployed for the securement of the belt retractor on the body part.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">In connection with safety belt retractors, one generally endeavors, for the reasons of achieving material and weight savings and the cost reductions associated therewith, to configure the housing with a lighter weight and with thinner sheet metal thicknesses, whereby the disadvantage associated therewith is that the housing, in the area of its fastening bracket, does not exhibit a sufficient deformation resistance and, in contemplating a threaded securement of the housing, the reduced material thickness is not sufficient for the provision of a threaded fastener receiver which will operate in the capacity of a securement means. Assistance in this regard has been provided by the provision of additional welded nuts provided with threads, whereby this involves an additional manufacturing effort in the manufacturing of the housing. The disadvantage of the reduced deformation resistance force in connection with the fastening bracket comes especially to the fore if the draw-off location of the belt at which the belt is drawn off the belt shaft supported in the U-shaped housing is disposed opposite the fastening bracket, as this is the case, for example, in the area of the back-sided cap repository of belt retractors installed in motor vehicles. In this event, a moment is exerted upon the fastening bracket or, respectively, the securement means, upon the loading of the belt during a blocking action.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">An arrangement having the state of the art features is disclosed, for example, in DE 197 52 191 A1. In this arrangement, there is provided, for the reason of facilitating the mounting of the arrangement, a mounting plate which is secured by tack welding before the mounting of the belt retractor to the body part; the mounting plate is provided with hook-shaped projections on which the housing of the belt retractor is to be suspended via engagement of the hook-shaped projections by correspondingly arranged longitudinal holes on the housing and, thereby, is to be maintained in a pre-positioned mounted disposition before subsequent securement onto the body part.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">At the least, the mounting of the mounting plate on the body part disadvantageously represents an additional installation effort; moreover, the mounting plate is not in the position to permit a configuration of the housing walls or, respectively, the fastening bracket, to be of a thin material thickness or to permit the provision of a threaded fastener receiver for receipt of a securement nut, because the fastening bracket of the belt retractor lies outside the mounting plate.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e892" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">The invention provides a solution to the challenge of providing a securement arrangement for a security belt retractor, which, in connection with the mounting of the security belt retractor in a motor vehicle, is easy to access and which makes possible a secure mounting as well as a configuration having a thin-walled housing with a sufficient force transmission capability.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">The solution to this challenge is set forth in the advantageous configurations and further embodiments of the invention recited in the content of the patent claims which follow this description.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The invention provides, in its core concepts, that the mounting plate is configured as a separate reinforcement plate with an access opening for a securement means and that the reinforcement plate comprises a slot-type opening for the insertion of the fastening bracket of the belt retractor therethrough in such a manner that the fastening bracket, upon the mounting of the belt retractor on the body part, comes to rest between the reinforcement plate and the body part and with the access openings for the fastening bracket and the reinforcement plate in alignment with one another. The advantage is connected with the invention that the separate reinforcement plate is insertable through the fastening bracket so that a substantial additional mounting effort is not called for. Since the optionally thin-walled fastening bracket of the housing of the belt retractor comes to rest, upon mounting, between the reinforcement plate and the body part of the motor vehicle, a sufficient force transmission is present upon a loading of the housing of the security belt retractor. The reinforcement plate is configured, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, with a material thickness such that the reinforcement plate has a jetted throughbore for the threads of a securement nut to be secured thereto.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, it is provided that the reinforcement plate has a region in which the access opening is formed and a region extending under the side shanks of the U-shaped housing. In connection with a tension loading thereof, the belt, in the configuration in which it is disposed on a side of the housing opposite to that of the fastening bracket, exerts a tipping moment on the housing which is advantageously opposed by the reinforcement plate, in that the reinforcement plate presses the fastening bracket of the housing downwardly and, thereby, resists a lifting of the fastening bracket away from the body part of the motor vehicle. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, it can be additionally provided that the reinforcement plate, in the region thereof extended into an under gripping relationship with the side shanks, comprises receipt openings for the receipt therein of projections projecting from the side shanks of the housing. In this manner, via the gripping engagement of the projections extending in the plane of the side shanks into the receipt openings of the reinforcement plate, there can advantageously be realized a stabilization and a spaced relationship maintaining capacity for the side shanks as well as the possibility for absorbing displacement forces in the plane of the body part.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">To the extent that the respective body part of the vehicle acting as the securement location of the safety belt retractor has a planar configuration, it can be provided, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, that the reinforcement plate as well is configured as a planar component and is mounted on the respective body part of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">To the extent that the respective body part onto which the safety belt retractor is secured is frequently provided in the region of the B-column of a vehicle or a vehicle seat with crimped bent out regions, in order to create room for the mounting of the securement means, it is provided, in one embodiment of the invention, that the reinforcement plate has a bent shape in its access opening forming region and a bent out shape in its housing side shank under gripping region. Via the configuration of the securement means with the required bending, it is advantageously made possible that the reinforcement plate, which is produced as a standard component in planar form, can be compatibly configured with the respective structure of the body part by simple bending thereof.</p>

<p id="P-00020" num="00020">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a belt retractor <b>10</b> is shown, the belt retractor having a belt <b>11</b> wound thereonto which can be withdrawn in the direction shown by the arrow <b>30</b> from the belt shaft which supports the belt. The housing of the belt retractor <b>10</b> comprises an outwardly extending fastening bracket <b>12</b> with an access opening <b>14</b> for receipt therethrough of a securement means for the securement of the belt retractor <b>10</b> onto a body part of the motor vehicle. In this connection, in this embodiment, the belt retractor <b>10</b> is a so-called &#x201c;left rotating&#x201d; belt, by which the belt <b>11</b>, in correspondence with the requirements of the installer, is unwound, from a side of the housing opposite to the side of the housing at which the fastening bracket <b>12</b> is disposed, in a direction opposite to the direction toward the fastening bracket <b>12</b>. An additional reinforcement plate <b>13</b> is deployed in connection with the mounting of the belt retractor <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">As can be seen in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b, </i>the housing <b>15</b> of the belt retractor is configured with side shanks <b>16</b>, in which receipt openings <b>17</b> are provided for mounting a non-illustrated belt shaft in the housing; the receipt openings <b>17</b> are, in various configurations, provided with a ratchet tooth assembly <b>18</b> for the blocking mechanism of the belt retractor. As can be seen when viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a, </i><b>2</b><i>b </i>together, the reinforcement plate <b>13</b> comprises a slot-type opening <b>25</b> through which the fastening bracket <b>12</b> of the housing <b>15</b> of the belt retractor is insertable in such a manner that the fastening bracket <b>12</b>, as seen in the mounted disposition of the belt retractor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, comes to rest between the reinforcement plate <b>13</b> and the body part of the vehicle; in this manner, there occurs an alignment of the access openings <b>14</b> respectively provided in the fastening bracket <b>12</b> and in the reinforcement plate <b>13</b> permitting the insertion therethrough of a securement means.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">The reinforcement plate <b>13</b> comprises a region <b>21</b> in which is formed the access opening <b>14</b> with the slot-type opening <b>25</b>, and the reinforcement plate extends, along a further region <b>22</b>, under the side shanks <b>16</b> of the housing <b>15</b> and under grips these side shanks thereat. In this region <b>22</b>, the reinforcement plate <b>13</b> is provided with receipt openings <b>19</b> in which are received, upon mounting of the housing <b>15</b>, projections <b>28</b> extending from the planes of the side shanks <b>16</b> so that the side shanks <b>16</b> are fixedly secured via the portions thereof having projections <b>28</b> extending through the reinforcement plate <b>13</b> and are thereby maintained at a spacing from the reinforcement plate. There is collectively provided in this manner a reinforcement of the housing <b>15</b>. The material thickness of the reinforcement plate <b>13</b> is selected such that the provision of a jetted or nozzle throughbore <b>20</b> for a threaded fastener receiver is possible.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>4</b><i>a, </i>the housing <b>15</b> of the belt retractor is secured on a planar body part <b>26</b> of the motor vehicle, whereby the reinforcement plate is configured as a planar component.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">To the extent that the body part <b>26</b> comprises a crimped bent out portion <b>27</b> for creating a receiving space for a securement means <b>29</b>, it is easily possible, in connection with the reinforcement plate <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a, </i>to compatibly configure the reinforcement plate to correspond to the shape and height of the crimped bent out portion <b>27</b> of the body part <b>26</b> by bending the reinforcement plate along its region <b>22</b> which under grips the side shanks <b>16</b> of the housing, in the manner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> or, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">The features of the subject matter of this arrangement, as disclosed in the foregoing description, the patent claims, the summary, and the drawings, can be of significance both individually as well as in preferred combinations with one another in the realization of the invention in its various embodiments.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">A tube connecting structure is formed with first and second cylindrical sections. The first cylindrical section includes: a joining cylinder with engagement holes disposed at a first end; a ring-shaped flange projecting radially inward from a second end; an inner cylinder extending co-axially toward the first end; and an inner cylindrical member separated axially from the inner cylinder. An O-ring is disposed co-axially between the inner cylinder and inner cylindrical member. Large and small diameter sections of the joining member align with a large-diameter section and small-diameter cylindrical section of the first tube, respectively, and are fitted into the space between the joining cylinder and the inner cylinder and inner cylindrical member. A second tube supported within the second cylindrical section is prevented from slipping out. The O-ring provides a fluid-tight seal between the first and second tubes.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e706" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention relates to a tube connecting structure that connects a first tube and a second tube with a connecting member and uses a sealing member to form a fluid-tight seal between an end of the first tube and an end of the second tube.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">U.S. Pat. No. 6,481,759 presents an example of a conventional tube connecting structure (see FIG. <b>17</b>). In this tube connecting structure, a main bushing unit <b>3</b><i>a </i>of press-in bushing means <b>3</b> is pressed into a resin tube <b>1</b>. The resin tube <b>1</b> has a flared end <b>1</b><i>a </i>having a large diameter. A joining member <b>2</b> is fitted to the outer perimeter of a shoulder <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the resin tube <b>1</b>. Also, a ring-shaped sealing member <b>4</b> is mounted in a ring-shaped groove formed by: the outer surface of the flared end <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the resin tube <b>1</b>; a ring-shaped stopper surface means <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the press-in bushing means <b>3</b>; and a cylindrical base section <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the joining member <b>2</b>. An insertion end <b>5</b><i>a </i>of a tube-shaped opposing member <b>5</b> is relatively fitted to the outer perimeter surfaces of stopper surface means <b>3</b><i>b </i>of press-in bushing means <b>3</b> and the base section <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the joining member <b>2</b>. A second engagement section <b>5</b><i>b </i>engages with a first engagement section <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the joining member <b>2</b>. As a result, the sealing member <b>4</b> provides a fluid-tight seal between the insertion end <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the flared end <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">However, in this conventional tube connecting structure, a chuck tool must be used to compress the tube while pressing the press-in bushing means into the resin tube. At the same time, the chuck tool must avoid contact with the joining member. The position of the joining member must therefore be moved inward along the axis of the resin tube to allow sufficient room for the chuck tool. Consequently, the flared end of the resin tube requires a straight section having a length that includes both the length of the joining member and the length of the chuck tool. When a flexible accordion tube is to be used with this conventional tube connecting structure, a very long straight section is needed at the end of the resin tube. In this situation, installation of a tube connecting structure with an accordion tube in a small space (e.g., in an automobile) can be extremely difficult due to space restrictions because this tube connecting structure requires a long, non-deformable straight section. Also, in the case of this conventional tube connecting structure, the press-in member is prevented from slipping out due to tension on the resin tube. If the tension on the resin tube decreases, however, the press-in member can slip out, allowing the opposing member and sealing member to slip out as well. Thus, the sealing properties of the tube connecting structure can be compromised.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e944" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">The objective of the present invention is to overcome the problems described above and to provide a tube connecting structure that: allows the straight section at the end of the tube to be short; prevents the tube and the sealing member from slipping out even if the tension on the tube is reduced; and maintains the sealing properties of the tube connection.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">In order to achieve the objectives described above, the invention provides a tube connecting structure wherein a cylindrical connecting member is formed integrally from a first cylindrical section disposed at a first axial end and a second cylindrical section co-axially disposed at a second axial end. A first tube is connected to the first cylindrical section and a second tube is connected to the second cylindrical section.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">The first cylindrical section includes: a joining cylinder formed with engagement holes at a first end at a plurality of perimeter positions; a ring-shaped flange projected radially inward from the second end of the joining cylinder; an inner cylinder extending within the joining cylinder co-axially from the ring-shaped flange toward the first end of the joining cylinder and separated by a predetermined distance from the first end of the joining cylinder; and an inner cylindrical member having a diameter identical to that of the inner cylinder and extending co-axially within the joining cylinder at a predetermined axial distance from a first end of the inner cylinder, one end of the inner cylindrical member being projected outward from the joining cylinder. An elastic ring-shaped sealing member is disposed co-axially between the inner cylinder and the inner cylindrical member.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The first tube includes: a large-diameter end having an inner diameter roughly identical to an outer diameter of each of the inner cylinder and the inner cylindrical member; and a small-diameter cylindrical section adjacent to the large-diameter end, having a diameter smaller than that of the large-diameter end.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">A joining member is disposed wherein the joining member is formed as a cylindrical shape by combining a pair of half-cylindrical members in which a second axial side is formed as a large-diameter section and a first axial side is formed as a small-diameter section. Engagement pieces are formed on the large-diameter section each half-cylindrical member at positions aligned with the engagement holes on the joining cylinder. The engagement pieces are projected radially outward and are elastically deformable in a radial direction. The joining member supports the first tube by fitting the large-diameter end of the joining member to the large-diameter section of the first tube and fitting the small-diameter section of the joining member to the small-diameter cylindrical section of the first tube. The joining member is inserted and fitted integrally with the first tube into a space formed between the joining cylindrical structure, the inner cylinder, and the inner cylindrical member. The engagement pieces of the large-diameter section of the half-cylindrical member engage with the engagement holes of the first cylindrical section so that the first tube is connected to the first cylindrical section.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">The second tube includes an insertion end extending in a straight manner and formed with a ring-shaped projection projecting radially outward at a predetermined distance from an end. The second tube is inserted into the second cylindrical section such that the ring-shaped projection engages with an engaging means formed integrally or separately from the second cylindrical section, thus preventing slippage. An end of the insertion end extends to the inner cylindrical member in the first cylindrical section. An inner perimeter surface of the large-diameter end of the first tube and an outer perimeter surface of an insertion end of the second tube are sealed in a fluid-tight manner by the elastic ring-shaped sealing member.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">In the present invention, the first tube is formed from a large-diameter end spanning axially from one end to a predetermined distance, with an inner diameter roughly identical to an outer diameter of the inner cylinder and the inner cylindrical member. The first tube also has a small-diameter cylindrical section adjacent to the large-diameter end. The large-diameter sections of the pair of half-cylindrical members of the joining member are aligned with the large diameter end of the first tube. The small-diameter sections of the pair of half-cylindrical members of the joining member are aligned with the small-diameter cylindrical section of the first tube. The joining member is thereby fitted to the first tube and provides support to the first tube. The joining member is fitted and inserted, integrally with the first tube, into a space formed by the joining cylinder of the first cylindrical section, and the inner cylinder and inner cylindrical member of the first cylindrical section. Engagement pieces of the large-diameter section engage with the engagement holes of the joining cylinder so that the first tube is joined with the first cylindrical section. In this manner, the joining member supports the first tube so that the first tube is connected with the first cylindrical section, and the joining member also serves as a chuck when the first tube is inserted and fitted to the first cylindrical section. Thus, there is no need to provide a separate straight section at the end of the first tube for chucking. As a result, the length of the straight section at the end of the first tube can be reduced.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">A shelf is formed between the large-diameter end and the small-diameter cylindrical section of the first tube. This shelf engages tightly against a shelf formed between the large-diameter section and the small-diameter section of the joining member. As a result, the first tube is reliably prevented from slipping out of the first cylindrical section without relying on tension to the inner cylinder and inner cylindrical member. Furthermore, the inner cylindrical member is prevented from moving axially outward because of the shelves of the joining member the first tube. Because the inner cylindrical member is prevented from moving axially outward, the elastic ring-shaped sealing member, which is supported between the inner cylinder and inner cylindrical member, is reliably prevented from slipping out of the first cylindrical section.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">Also, the large-diameter end of the first tube is inserted and fitted into the first cylindrical section, and the end of the insertion end of the second tube is extended to the inner cylindrical member of the first cylindrical section. Thus, the large-diameter end and the insertion end compress and support the elastic ring-shaped scaling member. This allows the elastic ring-shaped sealing member to provide a seal between the first tube and the second tube.</p>

<p id="P-00034" num="00034">The present invention is described with references to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a front-view cross-section drawing of a tube connecting structure according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 10</figref> show simplified views of the connecting member portion of the tube connecting structure. The tube connecting structure includes: a roughly cylindrical connecting member <b>10</b> extending axially straight from a first end to a second end; a first tube <b>40</b> formed as a resin accordion tube inserted and fitted from the open end at the first end of the connecting member <b>10</b>; a joining member <b>30</b> engaging the first tube <b>40</b> to the first end of the connecting member <b>10</b>; a second tube <b>47</b> inserted and fitted into the open end at the second end of the connecting member <b>10</b>; and an elastic ring-shaped sealing member <b>19</b> inserted and fitted into the connecting member <b>10</b> and serving to seal a space between the inner perimeter surface of the first tube <b>40</b> and the outer perimeter surface of the second tube <b>47</b>. With regard to the first and second ends of the connecting member <b>10</b>, the first end is shown as the rightward end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (i.e., the end of the connecting member <b>10</b> into which the first tube <b>40</b> is inserted). The second end is shown as the leftward end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (i.e., the end of the connecting member <b>10</b> into which the second tube <b>47</b> is inserted).</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the first tube <b>40</b> is an accordion tube formed from resin or metal. The straight insertion end <b>41</b> of the first tube <b>40</b> is formed by predetermined axial spans starting from the open end of the first tube <b>40</b>. The axially inward section of the first tube <b>40</b> forms the accordion section <b>45</b>. The insertion end <b>41</b> has a large-diameter end <b>42</b> at the outer end, and a small-diameter cylindrical section <b>43</b> disposed adjacent to and inward from the large-diameter end <b>42</b>. The small-diameter cylindrical section <b>43</b> has a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the large-diameter end <b>42</b>. A shelf <b>44</b> sloped at approximately 45 degrees is formed at the boundary between the small-diameter cylindrical section <b>43</b> and the large-diameter end <b>42</b>. The outer end of the large-diameter end <b>42</b> is projected radially outward in the form of a bent end <b>42</b><i>a </i>that has been bent radially outward and folded back horizontally.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second tube <b>47</b> is a resin or metal tube having a straight insertion end <b>48</b> that extends axially across a predetermined span from a first end of the second tube <b>47</b>. The insertion end <b>48</b> is also formed with a ring-shaped projection <b>49</b> projected radially.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The connecting member <b>10</b> is formed from a hard resin such as a fiberglass-reinforced nylon resin or the like. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 10</figref>, the connecting member <b>10</b> includes a first cylindrical section <b>11</b> at a first axial end and a second cylindrical section <b>12</b> at a second axial end. The first and second cylindrical sections are integrally formed. The first cylindrical section <b>11</b> includes the following integrally formed elements: a cylindrically shaped joining cylinder <b>12</b>; a ring-shaped flange <b>13</b> projected radially inward from the second end; and an inner cylinder <b>14</b> disposed axially within the joining cylinder <b>12</b> at a predetermined distance from the inner perimeter surface of the joining cylinder <b>12</b>, extending from the flange <b>13</b> and projected toward the first end, parallel to the joining cylinder <b>12</b>. All of the elements are formed with roughly the same thickness. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an inner cylindrical member <b>15</b> is disposed as a separate element in the first cylindrical section <b>11</b>. The inner and outer diameters of the inner cylindrical member <b>15</b> are the same as those of the inner cylinder <b>14</b>. Within the joining cylinder <b>12</b>, the second end of the inner cylindrical member <b>15</b> is axially separated from the first end of the inner cylinder <b>14</b> and is disposed co-axially with the joining cylinder <b>12</b>, extending along the axis thereof and projecting slightly outward from the joining cylinder <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">Four rectangular slot-shaped engagement holes <b>16</b> are formed along the perimeter of the joining cylinder <b>12</b>. The engagement holes <b>16</b> are separated equidistantly along the perimeter in the vicinity of the first end of the joining cylinder <b>12</b>. Ribs <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>are formed, slightly projected co-axially, at or near the second end of the joining cylinder <b>12</b>, along the entire perimeter of the outer perimeter surface. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the edges of the engagement holes <b>16</b> are sloped in a linear manner so that the holes become wider going from the inner perimeter side to the outer perimeter side. The inner cylinder <b>14</b> has an axial length that is approximately half that of the joining cylinder <b>12</b>. A first end projecting from the inner cylindrical member <b>15</b> is formed as a sloped end <b>15</b><i>a </i>by a cut out shaped as a conical surface that tapers toward the end. The space between the inner perimeter surface of the joining cylinder <b>12</b> and the outer perimeter surfaces of the inner cylinder <b>14</b> and inner cylindrical member <b>15</b> is formed with a thickness that is roughly the same as that of the joining cylinder <b>12</b>, inner cylinder <b>14</b>, and inner cylindrical member <b>15</b>, individually. This thickness is also roughly the same as the radial dimension of the bent end <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the first tube <b>40</b>. Two O-rings <b>18</b>, interposed by an elastic ring-shaped sealing member <b>19</b>, are disposed co-axially in the axial space formed between the co-axially disposed inner cylinder <b>14</b> and inner cylindrical member <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 through 15C</figref>, the joining member <b>30</b> is shaped cylindrically and is formed by combining two half-cylindrical members <b>31</b>, which have symmetrical shapes and are formed from resin. Each half-cylindrical member <b>31</b> has a large-diameter section <b>32</b> at a second end and a small-diameter section <b>33</b> at a first end, with an axial midpoint serving as the boundary. The boundary between the large-diameter section <b>32</b> and the small-diameter section <b>33</b> is formed as a shelf <b>34</b> that is sloped at approximately 45 degrees. The inner diameters of the large-diameter section <b>32</b> and the small-diameter section <b>33</b> are roughly identical to the outer diameters of the large-diameter end <b>42</b> and the small-diameter cylindrical section <b>43</b> of the first tube <b>40</b>, respectively. The thicknesses of the large-diameter section <b>32</b> and the small-diameter section <b>33</b> are slightly less than the space formed between the joining cylinder <b>12</b>, and the inner cylinder <b>14</b> and inner cylindrical member <b>15</b> of the first cylindrical section <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">A &#x201c;C&#x201d;-shaped groove <b>35</b><i>a </i>oriented in the axial direction is formed at a center position along the perimeter of the large-diameter section <b>32</b> of the half-cylindrical member <b>31</b>. The &#x201c;C&#x201d;-shaped groove <b>35</b><i>a </i>is disposed at the axial center position. A rectangular engagement piece <b>35</b> partitioned by the &#x201c;C&#x201d;-shaped groove <b>35</b><i>a </i>is projected radially outward by being bent approximately 30 degrees at its base. Also, right angle grooves <b>36</b><i>a </i>are formed at positions axially aligned with each engagement piece <b>35</b> of the large-diameter section <b>32</b> and at ends along the outer perimeter surface. Each right angle groove <b>36</b><i>a </i>extends axially and then bends at a right angle toward the outer perimeter surface. A rectangular half-engagement piece <b>36</b> partitioned by the right angle groove <b>36</b><i>a </i>is projected radially outward by being bent at approximately 30 degrees at the base. The combined size of the paired half-engagement pieces <b>36</b> of the paired half-cylindrical members <b>31</b> is the same size as each engagement piece <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">A ring-shaped rib <b>32</b><i>a </i>extending radially along the entire perimeter of the large-diameter section <b>32</b> is projected slightly outward from the outer perimeter surface near the shelf <b>34</b>. The small-diameter section <b>33</b> is also formed with a ring-shaped rib <b>33</b><i>a </i>extending radially along the entire perimeter and projected slightly outward from the outer perimeter surface. Furthermore, engagement projections <b>37</b><i>a</i>, <b>37</b><i>b</i>, and <b>37</b><i>c </i>are projected perpendicularly from a first perimeter surface of the half-cylindrical member <b>31</b> (the surface toward the bottom of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) and are aligned with the ring-shaped rib <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the large-diameter section <b>32</b>, the shelf <b>34</b>, and the ring-shaped rib <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the small-diameter section <b>33</b>, respectively. Engagement cavities <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b</i>, and <b>38</b><i>c </i>are formed on a second perimeter surface of the half-cylindrical member <b>31</b> (the surface toward the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) and are aligned with the ring-shaped rib <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the large-diameter section <b>32</b>, the shelf <b>34</b>, and the ring-shaped rib <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the small-diameter section <b>33</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">The large-diameter section <b>32</b> and the small-diameter section <b>33</b> of each half-cylindrical member <b>31</b> of the joining member <b>30</b> are aligned respectively with the large-diameter end <b>42</b> and the small-diameter cylindrical section <b>43</b> of the insertion end <b>41</b> of the first tube <b>40</b>. The engagement projections <b>37</b><i>a</i>, <b>37</b><i>b</i>, and <b>37</b><i>c </i>are fitted to the associated engagement cavities <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b</i>, and <b>38</b><i>c</i>, thus forming the joining member <b>30</b>, which is fitted to the outer perimeter surface of the insertion end <b>41</b> of the first tube <b>40</b>. As a result, the joining member <b>30</b> can grasp the first tube <b>40</b>. The joining member <b>30</b>, formed integrally with the insertion end <b>41</b> of the first tube <b>40</b> through grasping in this manner, can then be inserted and fitted into the space formed between the joining cylinder <b>12</b>, and the inner cylinder <b>14</b> and inner cylindrical member <b>15</b>. As a result, the joining member <b>30</b> and the insertion end <b>41</b> are both fitted into this space. Furthermore, the engagement pieces <b>35</b> and the half-engagement pieces <b>36</b> of the large-diameter section <b>32</b> are engaged with the engagement holes <b>16</b> of the joining cylinder <b>12</b> so that the joining member <b>30</b> is engaged with the joining cylinder <b>12</b> and the first tube <b>40</b> is tightly connected to the first cylindrical section <b>11</b> of the connecting member <b>10</b>. The first tube <b>40</b> is thereby interposed between the inner perimeter surface of the joining member <b>30</b> and the outer perimeter surfaces of the inner cylinder <b>14</b> and inner cylindrical member <b>15</b>. The shelf <b>34</b> of the joining member <b>30</b> and the shelf <b>44</b> of the first tube <b>40</b> are also aligned so as to block axial movement of the inner cylindrical member <b>15</b> toward the first end.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">The second cylindrical section <b>21</b> has inner and outer diameters that are identical to the inner and outer diameters of the joining cylinder <b>12</b> of the first cylindrical section <b>11</b>. The inner diameter of the second cylindrical section <b>21</b> is slightly larger than the outer diameter of the ring-shaped projection <b>49</b> of the second tube <b>47</b>. The ring-shaped projection <b>49</b> can be inserted from an open end <b>21</b><i>b </i>at the second axial end. through an axial hole <b>21</b><i>a</i>. In the second cylindrical section <b>21</b>, the second axial end is formed as an open cylindrical section <b>22</b>. Two axially extending joining sections <b>23</b> are symmetrically disposed at positions along the perimeter between the open cylindrical section <b>22</b> and the first cylindrical section <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">&#x201c;C&#x201d;-shaped cutouts are formed between the joining sections <b>23</b>. These cutouts are horizontally long and are formed along the perimeter wall of the second cylindrical section <b>21</b>, forming a pair of rotationally symmetrical slits <b>24</b>. The slits <b>24</b> form a pair of engagement pieces <b>25</b> having arcuate cross-sectional shapes perpendicular to the axis. Seen from the second end in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</figref>, these engagement pieces <b>25</b> extend clockwise from one joining section <b>23</b> to a position near the other joining section <b>23</b>, with the end of each engagement piece <b>25</b> being a free end. As a result, the elasticity of the resin material allows the free end of the engagement piece <b>25</b> to be elastically deformed radially outward in an arcuate manner from its base, which is secured to the joining section <b>23</b>. A first end of the slit <b>24</b> forms a first slit <b>24</b><i>a</i>; a second end of the slit <b>24</b> forms a second slit <b>24</b><i>b</i>. The first slit <b>24</b><i>a </i>is wider than the second slit <b>24</b><i>b </i>and engages the ring-shaped projection <b>49</b> of the second tube <b>47</b>. The perimeter end of the slit <b>24</b> forms a third slit <b>24</b><i>c</i>, which connects the first slit <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the second slit <b>24</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">The radially inward surfaces of the free ends of the engagement pieces <b>25</b> are formed with engagement projections <b>26</b> projecting radially inward. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 9</figref>, an inner surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the engagement projection <b>26</b> is formed in an arcuate shape along the perimeter. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a linearly sloped surface is formed with a diminishing inner radius from the second axial end toward the first axial end. The inner diameter of the axial second end of the inner surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>is roughly the same as the outer diameter of the ring-shaped projection <b>49</b> of the second tube <b>47</b>. The inner diameter of the first axial end is roughly the same as the outer diameter of the insertion end <b>48</b> of the second tube <b>47</b>. As a result, when the second tube <b>47</b> is inserted into the second cylindrical section <b>21</b> from the open end <b>21</b><i>b</i>, the insertion end <b>48</b> passes the inner surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the engagement projection <b>26</b> smoothly, but the ring-shaped projection <b>49</b> will abut the inner surface <b>26</b><i>a</i>. The ring-shaped projection <b>49</b> moves along the slope of the inner surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>so that the engagement projection <b>26</b> receives radial pressure, causing the engagement piece <b>25</b> to be elastically deformed and pushed radially outward, passing the engagement projection <b>26</b>. As a result, the state of engagement with the second tube <b>47</b> is released, the engagement piece <b>25</b> is restored, and the engagement projection <b>26</b> engages with the ring-shaped projection <b>49</b>. The engagement of the engagement projection <b>26</b> with the ring-shaped projection <b>49</b> blocks the movement of the second tube <b>47</b> toward the second end.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">When the second tube <b>47</b> is inserted into the second cylindrical section <b>21</b> in this manner, the insertion end <b>48</b> passes the engagement piece <b>25</b> and is inserted and fitted into the inner cylinder <b>14</b> of the first cylindrical section <b>11</b>. As the second tube <b>47</b> is inserted further toward the first end, the ring-shaped projection <b>49</b> passes the engagement piece <b>25</b> and is engaged by the engagement projection <b>26</b>, as described above, thus preventing the second tube <b>47</b> from slipping out of the second cylindrical section <b>21</b>. The end of the insertion end <b>48</b> passes into the inner cylinder <b>14</b>, passes the O-ring <b>18</b>, and is inserted into the inner cylindrical member <b>15</b>. Inside the first cylindrical section <b>11</b>, the O-ring <b>18</b> forms a fluid-tight seal between the insertion end <b>48</b> and the first tube <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">As described above, the first tube <b>40</b> is supported around the perimeter by the joining member <b>30</b> and is inserted and fitted into the first cylindrical section <b>11</b>. As a result, the joining member <b>30</b> connects the first tube <b>40</b> inside of the first cylindrical section <b>11</b> and also serves to chuck the first tube <b>40</b>. Thus, when the first tube <b>40</b> is inserted into the first cylindrical section <b>11</b>, there is no need to provide a separate section at the end of the first tube <b>40</b> for chucking, and the length of the straight section at the end of the first tube <b>40</b> can be made relatively short. A tube such as the one in this embodiment, where the first tube <b>40</b> includes a flexible accordion section <b>45</b>, can have a shortened, non-deformable straight section at the end. As a result, a tube connecting structure with an accordion section can be installed in a small, restricted space (e.g., in an automobile).</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">Also, the first tube <b>40</b> and the joining member <b>30</b> are together inserted and fitted integrally into the gap between the joining cylinder <b>12</b>, and the inner cylinder <b>14</b> and inner cylindrical member <b>15</b>. A shelf <b>44</b> is formed between the large-diameter end <b>42</b> and the small diameter cylindrical section <b>43</b> of the first tube <b>40</b>. This shelf <b>44</b> engages tightly with the shelf <b>34</b> at the boundary between the large-diameter section <b>32</b> and the small-diameter section <b>33</b> of the joining member <b>30</b>. As a result, the first tube <b>40</b> is reliably prevented from slipping out of the first cylindrical section <b>11</b> without having to rely on tension with the inner cylinder <b>14</b> and inner cylindrical member <b>15</b>. Thus, even if the tension on the first tube <b>40</b> decreases, the first tube <b>40</b> is reliably prevented from slipping out of the first cylindrical section <b>11</b>. Consequently, the material used to form the first tube <b>40</b> does not need to be an elastic material such as resin or rubber and can be a metallic material instead.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">Furthermore, because the inner cylindrical member <b>15</b> engages with the shelf <b>44</b> of the first tube <b>40</b> such that the inner cylindrical member <b>15</b> is prevented from moving toward the first axial end, the O-ring <b>18</b>, which is supported by the second axial end of the inner cylindrical member <b>15</b>, is also prevented from slipping out of the first cylindrical section <b>11</b>. The O-rings <b>18</b> create a fluid-tight seal between the inner perimeter surface of the large-diameter end <b>42</b> of the first tube <b>40</b> and the outer perimeter surface of the insertion end <b>48</b> of the second tube <b>47</b>. As a result, the connecting member <b>10</b> provides a tight seal between the first tube <b>40</b> and the second tube <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">In the connecting member <b>10</b> described above, the second cylindrical section <b>21</b> is integrally formed with the engagement piece <b>25</b>. The engagement piece <b>25</b> serves as an engaging means to allow insertion of the second tube <b>47</b> into the second cylindrical section <b>21</b> and to prevent the second tube <b>47</b> from slipping out. However, the structure of the engaging means is not restricted to engagement piece <b>25</b>. In an alternative embodiment, an engaging member can be mounted separately from the second cylindrical section. Also, the first tube does not have to be an accordion tube as described above and can be a straight tube. Other aspects of the tube connecting structure described in the above embodiments are presented as examples, and various alternate implementations may be effected within the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">In the present invention, a first tube is supported by a joining member formed from a pair of half-cylindrical members. As a result, the first tube can be connected to the first cylindrical section via the joining member, and the joining member can serve as a chuck when the first tube is fitted and inserted into the first cylindrical section. Thus, according to the present invention, there is no need to provide a separate straight section at the end of the first tube to serve as a chuck. This makes it possible to make the straight section at the end of the first tube shorter. As a result, the first tube can, for example, be an accordion tube with a short non-deformable straight section at the end. Thus, installation of the tube connecting structure of the present invention is not restricted by small spaces (e.g., spaces in an automobile).</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">Also, according to the present invention, the first tube is reliably prevented from slipping out of the first cylindrical section without relying on tension on the inner cylinder and inner cylindrical member. As a result, even if the tension on the first tube is reduced, the present invention reliably prevents the first tube from slipping out. Additionally, since the first tube does not require tension to prevent slippage, the first tube does not need to be formed from an elastic material and can be formed from a metallic material instead. According to the present invention, the shelves of the joining member and the first tube serve to prevent the inner cylindrical member from moving outward along the axis of the first cylindrical section. The elastic ring-shaped sealing member is reliably prevented from slipping out of the first cylindrical section by the shelf of the first tube, which prevents the inner cylindrical member from slipping out of the first cylindrical section. As a result, a reliable seal is provided between the first tube and the second tube of the tube connecting structure.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">Furthermore, in the present invention, the inner perimeter surface of the large-diameter section of the first tube is pressed against the elastic ring-shaped sealing member. In the second tube, the insertion end extends to the inner cylindrical member in the first cylindrical section and is also pressed against the elastic ring-shaped sealing member. Thus, the elastic ring-shaped sealing member maintains a tight seal between the first tube and the second tube.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e685" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">The present invention relates generally to the field of a device for improving the aerodynamic performance of a tractor-trailer thereby increasing fuel efficiency and more particularly to an underbody device for reducing wind or air resistance drag of the undercarriage of a trailer of a truck to enhance fuel economy.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">The problem of increased fuel consumption of a truck pulling a tractor-trailer resulting from air resistance or drag at increased speed is well known. The problem has been addressed in a number of ways or approaches by the prior art in reference to the combination of the truck and the trailer positioning, and the rear of the trailer. None of the offered solutions has addressed the wind resistance from the undercarriage of the trailer including the coefficient of drag of the landing gear assembly and the ICC bumper permanently affixed to the trailer.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">U.S. Pat. No. 2,126,943 to Best is entitled &#x201c;Motor Vehicle&#x201d; and discloses a conventional motor vehicle with improvements tending to reduce wind resistance to movement of vehicle bodies. The disclosed apparatus includes a flat, uninterrupted lower body surface with steerable road wheels partially housed within the body. The wheel pockets incorporating closure members or fairings that are coplanar with the underbody panel.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e705" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The device of the present invention provides an air drag reducing belly pan and air deflecting attachments to structural components of the underside of a trailer and box-trucks to enhance fuel economy. The conventional underside of a trailer consists of a series of equally spaced I-beams laterally spaced to support the floor and cargo of the trailer. Attached to the structure of the trailer include a landing gear assembly and an ICC bumper typically formed of square-shaped structural components allowing for a large frontal area exposed to oncoming air flow. The device of the present invention minimizes the frontal area exposed to direct air flow of the undercarriage I-beams and the structural attachments such as the landing gear and the ICC bumper during trailer movement. By reducing the fontal area of horizontal and vertical surfaces of the underside of a trailer by attaching a device consisting of a streamlined belly pan and air deflectors for the landing gear and the ICC bumper, air drag resistance will be reduced and fuel efficiency will be increased.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">An object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved air drag reducing device for the underside of a trailer and box-trucks.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved air drag reducing device that may be conveniently installed on existing trailers and box-trucks.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e937" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The invention relates to an adjuster mechanism for setting the height of an armrest on a motor vehicle door.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e947" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Known automobile armrest adjuster mechanisms, such as the mechanism disclosed in DE 40 02 242 A1, include a vertically adjustable armrest on the door of a motor vehicle which in order to adjust the height can be moved along two guide rails mounted in the vehicle door and extending in the adjusting direction of the armrest.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e957" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">An improved adjuster mechanism includes a drive as well as an adjusting gear which is assigned to the drive so that when the drive is activated it triggers an adjusting movement in order to set the height of the armrest which is mounted on the vehicle door. The height of the armrest (position of the armrest along the vertical vehicle axis) can hereby be adapted to the requirements of the different vehicle occupants.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">One object of the invention is to provide a new adjuster mechanism of a simple construction for adjusting the height of an armrest on a motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">This is achieved through the provision of an adjuster mechanism having an adjusting gear designed for adjusting the height of the armrest by swiveling the armrest about a swivel axis.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, in order to adjust the height of the armrest the armrest is not simply moved along the vertical vehicle axis but rather is swiveled about a swivel axis (running perpendicular to the vertical vehicle axis). The benefits of this embodiment are the small amount of space required and the simple construction of the adjuster mechanism. The guide rails, which are normally used to guide a vertically adjustable armrest, can be omitted if the height of the armrest is set not by sliding along the vertical vehicle axis but by a swivel movement.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">In one embodiment the swivel movement is carried out about a swivel axis running parallel to the longitudinal direction of the vehicle (x-axis).</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">Adjusting the height of an armrest by swiveling leads to the position of the supporting surface of the armrest (the position of that surface on which the arm of the vehicle occupant can be comfortably rested) changing in relation to both the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and the vertical vehicle axis. The armrest is therefore designed so that in any swivel region of the armrest serving as a useful region (a swivel area in which the individual swivel positions of the armrest enable the setting of several armrest positions whereby a vehicle occupant can lean the underarm portion of his arm on the armrest) there is a section of the armrest which is suitable for supporting the arm of a vehicle occupant.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">In order to enable the height of the armrest to be adjusted by a swivel movement, the armrest, or at least its supporting section which supports the arm, is formed eccentric relative to the swivel axis.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">In one embodiment of the present invention, the armrest is convex in shape so as to provide a suitably positioned supporting surface for the user's arm for each swivel adjustment to the height of the armrest. In a further embodiment, the supporting surface of the armrest forms in a cross-sectional view a section of a spiral.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">In order to generate the swivel movement the armrest can be provided with a gearing element which is coupled to the drive of the adjuster mechanism of the armrest. This gearing element can be comprised of a toothed segment which interacts with a gearwheel on the drive side, e.g. a pinion. On the other side the swivel axis of the armrest can be connected rotationally secured to an adjusting lever which in turn is coupled to a drive lever on the drive side.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">Because the armrest in the installed state normally protrudes from the inside door trim of the vehicle door towards the interior of the vehicle there is the problem that when the armrest is swiveled in order to adjust its height it could collide with the inside door trim. In order to overcome this the armrest and/or the inside door trim can be provided with a movable and/or elastic section which prevents any collision between the armrest and inside door trim that would otherwise obstruct the swivel action of the armrest. In an_example embodiment, a section of the inside door trim can be formed as a folding section (by means of a film hinge) or other suitable means so that it can be moved out of the way of the armrest when a section of the armrest projects into the inside door trim as it swivels round. As an alternative, the corresponding section of the inside door trim can be displaceable and the displacement can be controlled through a slide guide.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">The associated sections of the armrest and inside door trim can be elastic in order to give way and not obstruct the swivel movement of the armrest as the section of the armrest projects into the inside door trim.</p>

<p id="P-00023" num="00023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows a cross-section of an inside door trim <b>9</b> that is fixable on an inside door panel <b>5</b> of a motor vehicle door. The inside door trim <b>9</b> serves to cover the inside door panel <b>5</b> from the interior of the vehicle and has functional elements such as a card pocket and an armrest <b>2</b> (arm support) that protrudes from the inside trim towards the interior of the vehicle. The armrest <b>2</b> is vertically adjustable in order to ensure an ergonomic support of the underarm portion of the arm of the user of the armrest <b>2</b>, adapted to the requirements of each individual vehicle occupant.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">Adjusting the height of the armrest <b>2</b> by adjusting the supporting face of the armrest <b>2</b> along the vertical vehicle axis z, is carried out by swiveling the armrest <b>2</b> about a swivel axis <b>202</b> that extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle (perpendicular to the leaf plane). In order to generate the swivel movement an electrical or manual drive <b>4</b> is provided that drives a gearwheel <b>40</b> which interacts with a toothed section <b>204</b> provided on the armrest <b>2</b>. This toothed section <b>204</b> projects through an opening in the inside door trim <b>9</b> into the region between the inside door panel <b>5</b> and the inside door trim <b>9</b> where the drive <b>4</b> that is fixed on the inside door panel <b>5</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">In an alternative embodiment, the region of the inside door skin accommodating the drive <b>4</b> is formed by a base plate (module support) fitted onto the inside door panel rather than by the inside door panel itself. The different components of a vehicle door-(e.g. the adjusting mechanism of a vertically adjustable armrest, the window lifter) can be prefitted on the base plate outside of the vehicle door.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>show an armrest <b>2</b> the height of which is adjusted by swiveling the armrest <b>2</b> about an axis <b>202</b> that points substantially in the drive direction x. To this end the outer supporting contour of the armrest starting from the swivel axis <b>202</b> has an eccentric or spiral-shaped contour. The swivel axis <b>202</b> lies in the region of the plane of the inside door trim <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows the armrest <b>2</b> located in the fold-down position which allows good access and insight into the stowage compartment or card pocket. The dash-lined contour shows a lower to middle height of the armrest <b>2</b><i>a </i>where the arm is supported in the region of arrow A. An upper position of the armrest <b>2</b><i>b </i>is shown by the dotted-line contour with the supporting face in the region of the arrow B. When the armrest <b>2</b> is adjusted upwards by swiveling the armrest <b>2</b> about its swivel axis <b>202</b> the surface area of the armrest serving in each position as the supporting surface is moved both upwards with a component along the vertical vehicle axis z and also moves with a component of movement along a direction y pointing towards the inside I of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>shows an alternative embodiment where the adjustment to the armrest is carried out manually, in this case by a step switch mechanism operated by a grab handle <b>20</b> of the vehicle door that serves as the drive element. The grab handle <b>20</b> should be mounted capable of swiveling about the same axis <b>202</b> or an axis running parallel thereto and lockable in its neutral position. Swiveling the handle <b>20</b> upwards triggers a swivel movement of the armrest <b>2</b> in the same direction and raises the supporting surface. The supporting surface of the armrest is lowered back down in an analogous manner.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>shows a modification of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>regarding the configuration of the inside door trim <b>9</b> in a region above the armrest <b>2</b>. It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>that the inside door trim <b>9</b> has three layers above the armrest <b>2</b>, namely a support <b>95</b> made of plastics, a foam layer <b>96</b> mounted facing the inside of the vehicle as well as a textile covering <b>97</b> that covers the inside door trim <b>9</b> facing the inside I of the vehicle. The inside door trim <b>9</b> shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>can be formed in a corresponding manner above the armrest <b>2</b>. The region of the inside door trim <b>9</b> underneath the armrest <b>2</b> (which generally may have a card pocket as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) is normally of a simpler design given the fewer demands on the design in this area. It is also possible for this region of the inside door trim to have a multi-layered construction.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>also shows the region of the inside door trim <b>9</b> above the armrest <b>2</b> having a wedged recess <b>94</b> in the support <b>95</b> forming a film hinge so that the section of the inside door trim located between the film hinge and the armrest <b>2</b> can be folded towards the outside space A of the vehicle by applying external forces about the axis defined by the film hinge.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">This makes it possible for the inside door trim <b>9</b> to be brought from above directly down to the armrest <b>2</b> in order to avoid visible gaps impairing the design, and for the inside door trim <b>9</b> not to impede the swivel action of the armrest <b>2</b> but rather&#x2014;as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>&#x2014;to give way during swiveling of the armrest <b>2</b> through the folding movement K. Because of the ability of the section of the inside door trim <b>9</b> mounted underneath of the film hinge to fold as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>during swivel movement of the armrest <b>2</b> corresponding to adjusting the height of the armrest <b>2</b> along the vertical vehicle axis z, a collision is prevented between the inside door trim <b>9</b> and armrest <b>2</b>, that would oppose further swiveling of the armrest <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, regarding the region of the inside door trim <b>9</b> extending underneath the armrest <b>2</b>, a folding configuration is not as necessary because_the area <b>203</b> of the armrest <b>2</b> adjoining here need not be ergonomically designed. The area <b>203</b> can be designed with enough clearance so that collision with the inside door trim <b>9</b> during swivel movement of the armrest <b>2</b> is avoided. The area <b>203</b> of the armrest <b>2</b> is thus formed as a circular section having its center on the swivel axis <b>202</b> of the armrest <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a an alternate embodiment that enables the inside door trim <b>9</b> to give way as the armrest <b>2</b> swivels. To this end the section of the inside door trim <b>9</b> adjacent the armrest <b>2</b> at the top is formed as an elastic element in the form of a rubber strip <b>98</b> that has a fixing area <b>98</b><i>a </i>for fixing on the inside door trim <b>9</b> as well as a design area <b>98</b><i>b </i>that forms a part of the inside door trim <b>9</b> and extends up to the armrest <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">The fixing area <b>98</b><i>a </i>extends on the side of the inside door trim <b>9</b> facing away from the inside I of the vehicle and is connected there to the support <b>95</b> of the inside door trim <b>9</b> by a welded rivet <b>99</b>. The design area <b>98</b><i>b </i>of the rubber strip <b>98</b> is designed to be elastically deformable and for design reasons is provided with a covering <b>98</b><i>c</i>. As the armrest <b>2</b> swivels in order to be adjusted upwards along the vertical vehicle axis z the design section <b>98</b><i>b </i>of the rubber strip <b>98</b> is forced in a direction away from the inside I of the vehicle so that swivel movement of the armrest <b>2</b> is not impeded.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">In an alternative embodiment the corresponding section of the arm rest <b>2</b> could also be designed to be elastically deformable.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an alternative embodiment in which the section of the inside door trim <b>9</b> that adjoins the armrest <b>2</b> at the top is designed as a fascia <b>93</b> which can be moved along the vertical vehicle axis z. During swivel movement of the armrest <b>2</b> the fascia <b>93</b> is displaceable along the vertical vehicle axis z so that collision with the armrest <b>2</b> is avoided. The movement of the fascia <b>93</b> can be matched with the swivel movement of the armrest <b>2</b> with suitable coupling elements, for example by controlling the fascia <b>93</b> by sliding guide discs.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">As the armrest <b>2</b> is swiveled the fascia <b>93</b> is displaced so that the swivel movement of the armrest <b>2</b> is not prevented. The placement and articulation of the fascia is such that as far as possible no visible gaps appear between the inside door trim <b>9</b> and the armrest <b>2</b>.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e468" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention relates to a film production method and a film-element production method. In particular, it relates to a method for producing a film by a hydrothermal process and to a method for making a film element including the film prepared by this method.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Ferroelectric films for use in actuators and high-frequency devices are generally produced by a sol-gel method, a sputtering method, a metallorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method, or the like. However, these methods have drawbacks. For example, only limited types of substrates can be used to form ferroelectric films; production of films having complex shapes is impossible; film production requires high temperature or heat-treatment after the film formation; the composition of the film is difficult to control; and the mass productivity is poor when thick films are to be produced.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Hydrothermal processes for producing ferroelectric films have been developed to overcome these drawbacks. However, no ferroelectric films which are suitable for practical use have been obtained by hydrothermal processes.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">For example, Shimomura et al., Japanese Journal of Applied Physics, vol. 30, No. 9B, September 1991, pp. 2174-2177 disclose a method for producing a film composed of lead zirconate titanate (PZT), a typical ferroelectric material, by a hydrothermal method. An outline of this method is described below.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">First, a titanium substrate having surfaces oxidized by annealing at 700&#xb0; C. for 1 hour is immersed in a solution containing 6.82 mmol of lead nitrate {Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}, 2.73 mmol of zirconium oxychloride (ZrOCl<sub>2</sub>), and 50 mmol of potassium hydroxide (KOH), and a hydrothermal reaction is performed at 150&#xb0; C. for 24 hours to form a seed layer composed of lead zirconate (PZ) on the titanium substrate. Subsequently, the substrate with the PZ layer is immersed in a solution containing 6.82 mmol of lead nitrate {Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}, 2.73 mmol of zirconium oxychloride (ZrOCl<sub>2</sub>), 2.52 mmol of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>), and 50 mmol of potassium hydroxide, and a second hydrothermal reaction is performed at 120&#xb0; C. for 48 hours to form a single-phase PZT film.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">However, the relative dielectric constant of the PZT film prepared by the method described in the above article is 640, which is lower than that of PZT films prepared by general solid-phase methods. Moreover, the article indicates that the temperature characteristics of the capacitance exhibits thermal hysteresis, and that the dielectric loss is large due to an excessively small value of spontaneous polarization observed from the hysteresis.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e555" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">An object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a film that can overcome the above-described problems using a hydrothermal process. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a film element including the film prepared by this process.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">An aspect of the present invention provides a film production method including a film forming step of forming a film having a composition containing at least one predetermined metal element on a substrate, the film forming step comprising immersing the substrate in an aqueous solution containing the predetermined metal element to hydrothermally form the film; and a hydrothermal treatment step of hydrothermally processing the resulting film in an aqueous solution having a pH of about 5 to 7.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a film production method including a film-forming step of forming a film containing lead zirconate titanate on a substrate comprising titanium and a hydrothermal treatment step of hydrothermally processing the resulting film in an aqueous solution having a pH of about 5 to 7. The film forming step includes the steps of immersing the substrate in an aqueous solution containing lead and zirconium and heating the immersed substrate to form PbZrO<sub>3 </sub>seed crystals on the substrate; and hydrothermally treating the resulting substrate in an aqueous solution containing lead, zirconium, and titanium to allow the PbZrO<sub>3 </sub>seed crystals to grow and form the film comprising lead zirconate titanate.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">The present invention also provides a method for producing a film element including the film prepared as above, the method including the step of forming an electrode on the surface of the film.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">Since the film which has been hydrothermally formed on the substrate is subsequently subjected to a hydrothermal treatment in an aqueous solution having a pH of about 5 to 7, excess components and unreacted substances that are included in the film can be removed, and the film can thus exhibit proper characteristics.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">Particularly, when the present invention is applied to the production of PZT films, the relative dielectric constant of the film can be increased and the dielectric loss of the film can be decreased.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Accordingly, a film element having superior characteristics can be formed by forming an electrode on the surface of this film. For example, an electrode is formed on the surface of the PZT film to obtain a film element that can be used as an actuator or high-frequency device with superior dielectric characteristics.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e629" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">The present invention will now be described in reference to the FIGURE. The FIGURE is a cross-sectional view of a film element <b>4</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The film element <b>4</b> is constituted from a substrate <b>1</b>; a film <b>2</b> on the substrate <b>1</b>, the film <b>2</b> having a composition including at least one predetermined metal element; and an electrode <b>3</b> formed on the film <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">The film <b>2</b> is formed by a hydrothermal process. In particular, a substrate is immersed in an aqueous solution containing metal elements that constitute the film <b>2</b> so as to hydrothermally form the film <b>2</b> on the substrate <b>1</b>. No limit is imposed as to the material of the substrate <b>1</b>. Preferably, the substrate <b>1</b> contains at least one of the elements that constitute the film <b>2</b> to be formed.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">No limit is imposed as to the composition containing metal elements for making the film <b>2</b>. Examples of the composition include barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>) and modified substances thereof such as (Ba, Ca)TiO<sub>3</sub>, (Ba, Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub>, Ba(Ti, Zr)O<sub>3</sub>, Ba(Ti, Sn)O<sub>3</sub>, and (Ba, Ca)(Ti, Zr)O<sub>3</sub>. If necessary, Mn, Nb, SiO<sub>2 </sub>or the like may be added. Further examples of the composition include lead titanate (PT), lead zirconate (PZ), lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and lanthanum-doped zirconate titanate (PLZT). In this case, the composition may contain manganese, niobium, a rare earth element, or the like. Still other examples of the composition include potassium niobate (KNbO<sub>3</sub>); potassium tantalate (KTaO<sub>3</sub>); and potassium tantalate niobate (K(Ta, Nb)O<sub>3</sub>).</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">In fabricating the film <b>2</b> composed of PZT on the substrate <b>1</b>, for example, the substrate <b>1</b>, preferably composed of titanium, is immersed in an aqueous solution containing lead and zirconium so as to form PbZrO<sub>3 </sub>seed crystals on the substrate <b>1</b> by hydrothermal synthesis. Subsequently, the substrate <b>1</b> with seed crystals is subjected to hydrothermal synthesis in an aqueous solution containing lead, zirconium and titanium so as to allow the seed crystals to grow and form the film <b>2</b> composed of PZT.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">Subsequently, the film <b>2</b> on the substrate <b>1</b> is subjected to hydrothermal treatment in an aqueous solution at a pH of about 5-7. By this step of performing hydrothermal treatment on the formed film using an aqueous solution of a predetermined pH, excess components and unreacted substances are removed, and the proper characteristics of the composition constituting the film <b>2</b> can be exhibited. For example, when the film <b>2</b> is composed of a ferroelectric material, the relative dielectric constant of the film <b>2</b> can be increased to 750 or more, and the dielectric loss can be reduced to less than 4%.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">Next, a conductive film <b>3</b> is formed on the film <b>2</b>. No limit is imposed as to the method for forming the conductive film <b>3</b> or as to the material of the conductive film <b>3</b>. Considering the cost and the production efficiency, the conductive film <b>3</b> is, for example, formed by a sputtering method using silver, gold, platinum or the like.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The film element <b>4</b> made as described above is used as an actuator or a high-frequency device, for example.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">The present invention will now be described by way of EXAMPLES.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e938" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">A zirconium propoxide propanol solution (Zr: 1.56 mmol) and 46.64 g of isopropyl alcohol were placed in a polytetrafluoroethylene beaker.

<p id="P-00033" num="00033">The titanium foil with the film prepared in the fourth process was tied on a 40 mm&#xd7;20 mm&#xd7;1 mm polytetrafluoroethylene board with a platinum wire and was installed on a mixing rod of a mixing autoclave. A polytetrafluoroethylene beaker containing 200 cc of decarbonated water, the pH thereof being adjusted at 7.0, was installed in the mixing autoclave described above, and a hydrothermal reaction was performed at 180&#xb0; C. for 24 hours during which the titanium foil was stirred at a rotational speed of 50 rpm.

<p id="P-00055" num="00055">A comparison of EXAMPLES 1-3 with COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 demonstrates that the dielectric loss significantly increases or short-circuiting occurs in the film prepared by a hydrothermal method but not subjected to another hydrothermal treatment after the film formation. This is presumably due to the presence of excess or unreacted PbO, or due to potassium included in KOH used as a mineralizer. The step of hydrothermal processing after film formation that removes excess or unreacted PbO or potassium is important in achieving proper film characteristics.</p>
<p id="P-00056" num="00056">A comparison of EXAMPLES 1-3 with COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 demonstrates that the relative dielectric constant decreases if the pH of the aqueous solution used in the hydrothermal process is smaller than about 5.</p>
<p id="P-00057" num="00057">A comparison of EXAMPLES 1-3 with COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3 demonstrates that the dielectric loss of the film increases when the pH of the aqueous solution used in the hydrothermal process is larger than about 7.</p>
<p id="P-00058" num="00058">It should be noted that no limit is imposed as to the applicable temperature and time period for the hydrothermal process after film formation in an aqueous solution having a predetermined pH. When a polytetrafluoroethylene beaker is used as in the EXAMPLES above, the temperature of the hydrothermal process is preferably 250&#xb0; C or less, and more preferably 220&#xb0; C. or less.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">A method for the production of semiconductor components which includes applying masking layers and components on epitaxial semiconductor substrates within the epitaxy reactor without removal of the substrate from the reactor. At least one of the masking layers is HF soluble such that a gas etchant may be introduced within the reactor so as to etch a select number and portion of masking layers. This method may be used for production of lateral integrated components on a substrate wherein the components may be of the same or different type. Such types include electronic and optoelectronic components. Numerous masking layers may be applied, each defining particular windows intended to receive each of the various components. In the reactor, the masks may be selectively removed, then the components grown in the newly exposed windows.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="heading-d0e1079" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing semiconductor components wherein HF (hydrogen fluoride) soluble masking material is used. The components may be optoelectronic or electronic semiconductor components or laterally integrated semiconductor components wherein electrical and optoelectronic semiconductor components are individually used or combined.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">It is known in the art that HF soluble layers on an epitaxial substrate, such as a semiconductor substrate, may be chemically (wet or dry) removed outside of an epitaxial reactor. By this method, laterally integrated components may be produced by selective epitaxy or heteroepitaxy.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">In selective epitaxy, HF soluble layers are use for masking. Select layers are grown in the epitaxy reactor and thereafter, masked areas are chemically (wet or dry) removed outside of the reactor. For further integrations, additional lithographic steps would be necessary.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">In heteroepitaxy, direct semiconductors (connection semiconductors) are applied on a silicon substrate. The natural oxide of the silicon, SiO<sub>2</sub>, which is created by the contact of the substrate with oxygen, produces considerable problems. To remove this SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer the substrate needs to be exposed to high temperatures in the order of approximately 900&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">As such, in both methods, the substrate is removed from the reactor and exposed to ambient air. Accordingly, the substrate may be exposed to uncontrolled contamination. By multiple insertions and removals of the substrate into and from the reactor, the above processes become susceptible to faults, the gain of functional components decreases, and the production costs increase. For example, in heteroepitaxy electrical and optoelectrical components are integrated. In general, the electrical components already exist on the semiconductor substrate prior to the application of the optoelectronic components. During the high temperature step of removing the natural oxide of the silicon, at least the electrical components may be damaged.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1131" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">It is an object of the present invention to avoid, as much as possible, the removal of the semiconductor substrate from the epitaxy reactor. It is a further object, to avoid as much as possible the high temperature steps discussed above. It is still further object to provide a method, which can be implemented so as to enable mass production at reasonable engineering effort and expense and with maximally replicable component characteristics.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">With the foregoing and other objects in view, there is provided in accordance with the invention, a method for producing semiconductor components, comprising the steps of: applying at least one HF soluble masking layer on an epitaxy substrate such that said masking layer defines at least one epitaxy first window wherein said masking layer is not applied; epitaxially growing at least one semiconductor layer in at least one of said first window, said epitaxial growth occurring within an epitaxy reactor; and removing said masking layer through use of an etchant, said etchant comprising at least a fluoride, and said removal occurring within said reactor.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">The present invention also comprises a method of producing laterally integrated semiconductor components, comprising the steps of: applying a first semiconductor component on an epitaxial substrate; layering a first HF soluble mask over said first semiconductor component and epitaxial substrate, said mask defining windows on said substrate for application of other semiconductor components; and applying second semiconductor components in said windows.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">The present invention further comprises a method for producing semiconductor components comprising the steps of: applying at least one first semiconductor component on an epitaxial substrate; applying n number of masking layers on said epitaxial substrate and the first semiconductor component, wherein each of said masking layers defines a window for application of other semiconductor components and wherein n is a natural number; etching at least one of said n number of masking layers; and applying at least one other semiconductor component in at least one of said windows defined by said etched masking layer.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">The corroding of the HF soluble layers takes place in the epitaxy reactor by induction of hydrogen fluoride (HF) or an unstable fluoride combination. The unstable fluoride combination is marked thereby, that it disintegrates by light stimulation or by warming to at least one hundred degrees Celsius as well as it releases hydrogen fluoride. With some fluoride combinations, other or additional gases, so called carrier gases, may be introduced. Usually H<sub>2</sub>, N or Argon is used. The introduction of theses carrier gases is necessary fo unstable fluoride combinations, but not for hydrogen fluoride. Because many epitaxy reactors consist of quartz glass, which reacts with the corrosive fluoride, the reactor walls must be protected from such corrosive gas. This is done preferably by cooling the reactor walls so as to reduce the reactivity of these thermally unstable gases.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">Different components can be produced through the use of different HF soluble masking materials, each with different layer thicknesses. Herein, the different HF soluble masking materials are lifted away in different etching steps without interrupting the process as a whole. As such, during different layering steps, different epitaxy materials can applied epitaxially. With the use of suitable masking defining components, later lithographic processes can be advantageously reduced. In addition, costs savings may be incurred by avoiding the steps of removing and inserting the substrate into the epitaxy reactor.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">According to the method of the present invention, already preprocessed semiconductor components (e.g. electrical components) may be connected with more semiconductor components of another type (e.g. optoelectronic components). To facilitate this advantage, already existing semiconductors components may be selectively covered with a thick HF soluble layer. Areas intended for optoelectronic semiconductor components would then be covered with a thin HF soluble layer. By an in situ etching step, the areas for the optoelectronic components would be exposed, while the electrical components remain protected by a thinner layer of HF soluble masking material.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">The invention will now be set out in greater detail below with reference to exemplary embodiments shown in the drawings.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1287" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">Reference is now made to the figures of the drawings in which elements at are identical or function identically are identified by the same reference numerals throughout. Prior to the start of any of the methods to be described below, it is within the scope of each to clean the epitaxial substrate, prior to any applications, with the introduction of at least one fluoride based hydrogen fluoride soluble layer. The cleaning may occur within or outside the epitaxy reactor. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c</i>, an epitaxy substrate <b>9</b> is depicted with a masking layer <b>3</b> comprising one of HF soluble material. Such material may be SiO<sub>2 </sub>or Si<sub>8</sub><sub>8</sub>. The masking layer <b>3</b> defines windows <b>4</b>. The substrate, if not already present, is placed in an epitaxy reactor. Herein and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, a layering sequence <b>10</b> is commenced in the windows <b>4</b>. The sequence may be a semiconductor laser effected by MOVPE (metal organic vapor phase epitaxy). The application step is further indicated by arrows <b>11</b>. Next and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, the masking layer <b>3</b> is removed by etching <b>12</b> of a fluoride combination (for example HF), which may be introduced in the epitaxy reactor after the epitaxy. The process temperature lies preferably between 50 and 500&#xb0; C. The substrate <b>9</b> or wafer is now ready for additional processing.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<b>2</b><i>d </i>depict procedural steps according to the present invention undertaken to produce a laser structure having an active area <b>1</b>, a first vertical wave guide <b>2</b>, and a second horizontal wave guide <b>8</b>. As a first step and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, a HF soluble masking layer <b>3</b> (e.g. be SiO<sub>2</sub>, Si<sub>8</sub>N<sub>8</sub>) is directly applied onto an epitaxy substrate <b>9</b>. The masking layer <b>3</b> defines windows <b>4</b>. Next and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, in an epitaxy reactor a first wave-guide layer <b>5</b> is applied in windows <b>4</b>. An active area layer <b>6</b> is applied thereon. Then a second wave guide layer <b>7</b> is applied thereon. The first and second wave-guide layers <b>5</b> and <b>7</b> form at least one part of the vertical wave-guide <b>2</b>. Next and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>, the masking material <b>3</b> is removed through exposure to a corrosive gas. The corrosive gas may comprise NF<sub>3 </sub>and ay be inserted into the epitaxy reactor after the epitaxy together with a carrier gas (e.g. H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2 </sub>Ar, etc.). The temperature within the reactor lies in the range of 50 and 500&#xb0; C. Next and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d</i>, wave-guide material is applied without prior removal of the substrate from the reactor. Accordingly, the vertical wave-guide <b>2</b> and lateral wave-guide <b>8</b> are produced.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The application of the present method to integrated semiconductor components is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>c</i>. The components may be electrical and optoelectrical. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, electrical components <b>13</b> may comprise transistors, diodes, amplifiers, and the like. Optoelectronic components <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>) may comprise laser diodes, optical amplifiers, light emitting diodes and the like. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, electrical components <b>13</b> are applied on substrate <b>9</b> below HF soluble masking layer <b>3</b>. The masking layer <b>3</b> defines windows <b>4</b> along the substrate <b>9</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, the optoelectronic components are grown in windows <b>4</b>, per arrows <b>11</b>. Thereafter and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>c</i>, the masking layer is removed <b>2</b> by introduction of a fluoride combination into the epitaxy reactor. Now, the wafer can be further processed with, for example additional, electrical contacts and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">Additionally, the above steps depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>c </i>may be effected with application of a thicker masking layer <b>3</b> on the electrical components than in areas for the optoelectronic components. A masking layer removal procedure in the epitaxy reactor will remove a layer of masking revealing an area for application of the optoelectronic components while leaving the electronic components protected by a remainder masking layer. This procedure has the advantage of additional protection for the electronic components during growth of the optoelectronic components or other intermediary steps envisioned by one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c </i>depict method steps for producing integrated semiconductor components, wherein first, second and third semiconductor components <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> may be interconnected. These semiconductor components may be the same or of a different type. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, epitaxy substrate <b>9</b> has a first <b>18</b>, a second <b>19</b>, and a third HF soluble masking layer <b>20</b> applied thereon. The masks can be of the same or different composition and/or the same or different thickness. Of the masking layers, first mask layer <b>18</b> is first applied. This mask layer defines windows where later application of the semiconductor components will be performed. The second masking layer <b>19</b>, applied next, defines windows where first semiconductor component <b>15</b> will be later applied. The third masking layer <b>20</b>, defines windows where first and second semiconductor components <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> will be later applied.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, the first semiconductor components <b>15</b> are applied on the epitaxial substrate <b>9</b>. Then, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, the third masking layer <b>20</b> is removed. In addition, a portion of the second masking layer <b>19</b> may be removed. Both removals may be performed by etching, within the epitaxy reactor, by the introduction of a fluoride combination. Next, the second semiconductor components <b>16</b> are epitaxially precipitated on the epitaxy substrate <b>9</b> in the windows defined by the remaining second masking layer <b>19</b>. Thereafter and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>, the remainder of second masking layer <b>19</b> is removed by etching within the epitaxy reactor via the introduction induction of a fluoride combination. Next, third semiconductor components <b>17</b> are applied in the windows defined by first masking layer <b>18</b> and the already applied semiconductor components. These method steps can be enlarged to incorporate any number and types of semiconductor components. Herein, the number of masking layers and removing steps would be similarly enlarged, according to the guidelines presented above, so as to correspond to the increased number and/or type of semiconductor component.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications would be obvious to one skilled in the art intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e929" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Filed of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">This invention relates to modified conjugated diene polymers, and more particularly to a modified conjugated diene polymer obtained by polymerizing a conjugated diene compound(s) with a catalyst of a rare earth element compound and then subjecting the resulting polymer just after the polymerization to a modification or coupling reaction with a specified compound so as to interact with a rubber reinforcement such as carbon black or the like to improve a dispersibility of the rubber reinforcement into rubber ingredient and having excellent properties such as rebound resilience, wear resistance, mechanical properties and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">Heretofore, there have been proposed many polymerization catalysts for conjugated dienes, which play an industrially very important role. Particularly, many polymerization catalysts giving a high content of cis-1,4-bond have been studied and developed for providing conjugated diene polymers having high performances in the thermal and mechanical properties. For example, there are well-known composite catalyst systems containing a compound of a transition metal such as nickel, cobalt, titanium or the like as an essential component. Among them, some catalysts have industrially and widely been used as a polymerization catalyst of butadiene, isoprene or the like (see End. Ing. Chem., 48, 784(1956) and JP-B-37-8198).</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">On the other hand, a composite catalyst system comprising a rare earth metal compound and an organometal compound of an element of Group I-III has been studied and developed in order to attain a further higher content of cis-1,4-bond and an excellent polymerization activity, and also studies on a high stereospecific polymerization using the same have been actively conducted.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">In JP-B-47-14729 is disclosed a catalyst system comprising a rare earth metal compound such as cerium octanoate or the like, an alkylaluminum hydride such as diisobutylalumium hydride or the like, a trialkyl aluminum and an aluminum halide such as ethylaluminum dichloride or the like. Particularly, there is a description that a catalyst activity is increased by maturating such a catalyst system in the presence of butadiene.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">In JP-B-62-1404, JP-B-63-64444 and JP-B-1-16244 is proposed a method of enhancing the catalyst activity by increasing a solubility of a rare earth element compound in a polymerization solvent. And also, JP-B-4-2601 discloses that a catalyst system comprising a rare earth metal compound, trialkylaluminum or aluminum hydride, and an organic halogen derivative indicates a higher activity in the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene as compared with the conventional catalyst.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">However, polymers obtained by using the conventional catalyst systems including the rare earth metal compound becomes wider in the molecular weight distribution and do not sufficiently improve the wear resistance and rebound resilience.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">In JP-A-6-211916, JP-A-6-306113 and JP-A-8-73515 is reported that when a catalyst system consisting of a neodymium compound and methyl aluminoxane is used, a high polymerization activity is indicated and a conjugated diene polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution is obtained.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">However, in this polymerization method, it is required to use a greater amount of methyl aluminoxane as compared with the conventional catalyst system using the organoaluminum compound in order to hold the sufficient polymerization activity and obtain a polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution. Furthermore, such a catalyst is expensive as compared with the usual organoaluminum compound and also the cold flow becomes large to cause a problem in the storage stability, so that it comes into problem in the practical use.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">In order to solve these problems, JP-A-10-306113 and JP-A-10-35633 report that the cold flow can be controlled by modifying the conjugated diene polymer polymerized in the presence of the catalyst system using the methyl aluminoxane with a hetero three-membered compound, a halogenated metal compound, a metal carbonate or the like.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">However, when the resulting conjugated diene polymer is used with carbon black to prepare a rubber composition, the interaction between such a polymer (rubber) and carbon black is insufficient and hence the dispersibility of carbon black into the resulting rubber composition is poor and the wear resistance and mechanical properties of a vulcanizate made from such a rubber composition are not obtained at a satisfactory level.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e994" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">The inventors have made various studies and found out that when using a catalyst system comprising a rare earth metal compound, aluminoxane, an organoaluminum compound and a halogen-containing compound, the catalyst activity is sufficiently high even at a small amount of aluminoxane used and a conjugated diene polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution is obtained, and also the interaction with carbon black is improved by reacting (modifying or coupling) with a specified compound after the polymerization to provide a rubber composition having excellent rebound resilience, mechanical properties, processability and wear resistance for a vulcanizate, and as a result the invention has been accomplished.</p>

And also, it is understood from Comparative Example 2 that each property after the vulcanization is excellent as compared with that of the polymer modified with the well-known modifying agent.</p>
<p id="P-00168" num="00168">Similarly, the breaking strength, rebound resilience and wear resistance after the vulcanization in Examples 7-12 are improved as compared with those of Comparative Examples 3 and 4, from which it is understood that the properties after the vulcanization are improved by using the above modifying agents irrespectively of the catalyst composition.</p>

However, it is apparent from Comparative Examples 6-11, 14 and 17 that the sufficient effect of improving the properties is not obtained when the amount of the polymer according to the invention is too small per 100% by weight in total of rubber ingredient.</p>

<p id="P-00012" num="00012">The present invention relates to a process for preparing (cyclo)aliphatic diisocyanates and triisocyanates by the phosgenation of (cyclo)aliphatic diamines and triamines in the gas phase using special reactors.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e647" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">It is known that (cyclo)aliphatic diamines can be phosgenated in the gas phase. In SU-A 00 407 567 the reactor used for this purpose is heated on the outside and on the inside and provided with cooling coils in order to remove the heat of reaction. On the inside of this reactor is a holder for the preheating units around which are arranged pipes through which the reactants are passed. The reactor itself also has external heaters. The preheaters and the external heaters are switched on until the temperature reaches 210&#xb0; C. to 230&#xb0; C. A stoichiometric quantity of phosgene is then passed through one pipe, while the gaseous or liquid amine reaches the reactor via the other pipe. The reactor has previously been heated to a temperature of 30&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C. above the boiling temperature of the amine. Gaseous isocyanate is then formed in the reactor. The heat of reaction is removed through cooling coils. When the latter have become sufficiently hot, the heater is switched off. The external heater is switched on only if this is necessary in order to compensate for heat losses, so that the product does not cool to below 210&#xb0; C. to 230&#xb0; C. The gaseous products leave the reactor through an outlet. The disadvantage of this reactor is that it is suitable only for batch operation.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">In GB-A 1 165 831, the reaction is carried out in a tubular reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The reactor resembles a film evaporator in which the stirrer mixes the gases and at the same time brushes over the heated walls of the tubular reactor, in order to prevent a build-up of polymeric material on the wall of the pipe. However, the use of a high-speed stirrer when handling phosgene at a temperature of approximately 300&#xb0; C. necessitates great expense on safety measures to seal the reactor and retain the stirrer in the highly corrosive medium.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">EP-A 0 289 840 and EP-A 0 749 958 describe a cylindrical reaction chamber without moving parts, in which the reactants are reacted with one another while a turbulent flow is maintained. The geometrical form of the cylindrical reaction chamber leads to back-mixing processes, as a result of which the products react with the diamine starting material to form solid deposits. This leads to contamination of the reactor and blockages in the path of the gas.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">The phosgenation of aromatic diamines is described in EP-A 0 593 334 in which the reactants are initially mixed in a turbulent flow (at Reynolds numbers of at least 3000, preferably at least 8000). The reaction is then carried out under laminar or turbulent flow conditions in a tubular reactor without movable mixing elements and with a constriction of the walls. The fact that it is possible to phosgenate aromatic diamines cannot automatically be transferred to aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diamines or triamines because the corresponding reactions differ fundamentally from one another with regard to mechanism, solid-forming secondary reactions and required reaction times.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">It is an object of the present invention to produce (cyclo)aliphatic isocyanates by the gas-phase phosgenation of the corresponding amines while avoiding the previously mentioned disadvantages of prior art.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">This object may be achieved with the process of the present invention by carrying out the reaction in a reactor which differs from the prior art cylindrical form in a specific way, which is described below.</p>

<p id="P-00044" num="00044">Before the process according to the invention is carried out, the phosgene used for the phosgenation reaction is heated to a temperature of 200&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C., preferably 250&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">Shortly before being mixed in the reactor, both reactants may be passed over torque-producing baffles in order to stabilize the flow.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">To carry out the process according to the invention, the preheated and optionally torque-laden flows of the diamine or diamine-inert gas mixture and phosgene are passed continuously into a reaction chamber without moving parts, with constrictions of the walls, and mixed together. The size of the apparatus used depends upon the quantity of product to be produced.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">Suitable reaction chambers have, for example, an abrupt widening of the cross-sectional area at an angle of 80&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, preferably 90&#xb0;, in the direction of flow after the mixing of the two educts. Here the ratio of the cross-sectional areas of the reaction chamber after and before the widening is 3:1 to 7:1, preferably 4.5:1 to 5.5:1. Eddies, which keep the main flow away from the reactor wall, may develop at this widening point. This shape can consequently decrease the contact of the reaction zone with the container wall. The polymerizable products are thereby kept away from the reactor wall and the formation of solid deposits and possible contamination are thus decreased.</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">Another suitable embodiment of the reaction chamber according to the invention has a cascade-like and/or continuous variation in the cross-sectional area. In this way the flow rate of the reaction mixture along the axis of the reactor can be adjusted. A narrowing of the cross-section or preferably a slight widening up to twice, preferably up to 1.5 times, the initial cross-section, as a result of the enlargement in volume leads to an acceleration of the flow during the reaction. This stabilizes the flow and counteracts the risk of back flows. The flow rate of the reaction mixture can be maintained exactly constant along the length of the reactor by a suitably chosen widening of the cross-sectional area. In this way the available reaction time is increased, with the same length of reactor.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">The reactors are preferably prepared from steel, glass, or alloyed or enamelled steel and are a sufficient length to facilitate a complete reaction of the amine with phosgene under the process conditions. The gas flows are generally introduced into the reaction chamber at one end. This introduction can be effected, for example, through nozzles attached to one end of the reactor, or through a combination of nozzle and annular gap between nozzle and wall. The mixing zone is also maintained at a temperature of 200&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C., preferably 250&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C. This temperature is maintained, if necessary, by heating the reactor.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">While the process according to the invention is being carried out, the pressure is preferably 200 mbar to 3000 mbar within the feed pipes to the reaction chamber and 150 mbar to 2000 mbar at the outlet of the reaction chamber. The flow rate within the reaction chamber is at least 3 m/s, preferably at least 6 m/s and most preferably 10 m/s to 120 m/s and is maintained by a suitable pressure differential. Under these conditions, turbulent flows generally prevail within the reaction chamber.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">An advantage of the process according to the invention is that a reactor having a higher space-time yield is attained, together with an equal or better quality of product. The useful life of the reactor (i.e., the production time in relation to idle times, which are necessary for the cleaning of the reactor) can be increased by 40% to 60%, depending upon the isocyanate produced.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">The invention is further illustrated but is not intended to be limited by the following examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e927" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">The process according to the invention is explained in more detail by the following Example.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">Into a mixing tube with a downstream diisocyanate condensation step and a phosgene adsorption tower filled with activated carbon, 5.91 mol/h of phosgene, which had been heated to a temperature of 400&#xb0; C. at a pressure of 1100 mbar in an upstream heat exchanger, flowed continuously through a nozzle with an external diameter d<sub>1 </sub>of 1.7 mm and an internal diameter d<sub>0 </sub>of 1.0 mm, which projected into the mixing tube. At the same time, a mixture of 1.26 moles of gaseous hexamethylene-diamine and 1.25 moles of nitrogen, heated to 400&#xb0; C., was passed hourly into the mixing tube through the annular gap between nozzle and mixing tube. The diameter of the mixing tube varied along the longitudinal axis by decreasing down to a diameter d<sub>2 </sub>of 2.5 mm, at an angle &#x3b1; of 10&#xb0;, upstream of the nozzle and up to 1.5 mm downstream of the nozzle as shown by length l<sub>1 </sub>in the FIGURE, and then remaining constant along length l<sub>2</sub>, which had a length of 17.5 mm. Over the 20 mm length l<sub>3 </sub>the diameter increased at an angle &#x3b2; of 5&#xb0; until the diameter d<sub>3 </sub>was 6.0 mm. The diameter then increased to 10.0 mm as shown by diameter d<sub>4</sub>. A pressure of approximately 350 mbar was maintained in the mixing tube by applying a vacuum to the outlet from the phosgene adsorption tower. In a condensation step, the hot reaction mixture leaving the reaction chamber was passed through dichlorobenzene, which was maintained at a temperature of 150&#xb0; C. to 160&#xb0; C. A selective condensation of diisocyanatohexane took place. The gas mixture, which substantially contained nitrogen, hydrogen chloride and excess phosgene, was passed through the washing step and subsequently freed from phosgene in the adsorption tower. The diisocyanate was recovered in pure form from the washing solution by distillation. The yield of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane was 98.0% of the theoretical yield.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e999" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention relates to an element for making an electric contact to another contact member for enabling an electric current to flow between said element and said contact member, said element comprising a body having at least a contact surface thereof coated with a contact layer to be applied against said contact member, as well as a sliding electric contact arrangement in which two contact surfaces adapted to be applied against each other for establishing an electric contact may slide with respect to each other when establishing and/or interrupting and/or maintaining the contact action.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">Such a contact element may have many different applications, in which said contact layer is arranged for establishing a contact to a contact member with desired properties, such as a low contact resistance and a low friction coefficient with respect to the material of the contact member to be contacted etc. Such applications are for instance for making contacts to semiconductor devices in a wafer of one or more such devices, for establishing and interrupting electric contact in mechanical disconnectors and breakers and for establishing and interrupting electric contacts in contact arrangements of plug-in type. Such electric contact elements, which may establish sliding contacts or stationary contacts has preferably a body made of for instance copper or aluminium. It is known to coat said body with a contact layer of metal for protecting contact surfaces of the contact element against wear and corrosion. However, it has turned out that the metals used until now for such a contact layer have shown a tendency to get stuck to the surface on the contact member bearing thereagainst, which may result in damaging surface near portions of the contact element and/or contact member when traction forces attempt to move the contact element with respect to the contact member, for instance as a consequence of a difference in coefficient of thermal expansion of the material of the contact element and that of the contact member upon temperature changes or when the contact element and the contact member are to be moved with respect to each other in a sliding contact. This problem has been solved by lubricating the contact surfaces of the contact element and the contact member with a lubricant. Such a lubricant may have an oil or a fat as base, but solid lubricants, such as graphite or different types of plastics, also exist. However, solid lubricants have a poor electric conductivity and are often worn away when the contact surfaces are sliding against each other.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">An example of a contact layer having lubricating properties is given in U.S. Pat. No. 5,316,507. A solid lubricant, graphite of a certain particle size, mixed with a powder of an electrically conducting material, for instance gold, is pressed to a body being sintered. The gold grains are melting together during the sintering and the graphite stays in cavities in the gold. The sintered body is rolled into a band in a plurality of rolling steps with intermediate heat treatments, and the band is used as a conducting and lubricating contact layer for contact elements. A disadvantage of this electrically conducting and lubricating contact layer is that it requires a complicated and therefore very costly manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">A problem when using a lubricant based on fat or oil is that it is difficult to apply a uniform layer of the lubricant on the contact surface. Thick films of the lubricant influence the electric properties negatively and thin films of the lubricant are often worn away by mechanical influence. Another problem when using a lubricant is that it is volatile and will thereby contaminate other components. An additional problem is that the lubricant is sticky, which means that it gets stuck on components not to be lubricated and that it will easily absorb impurities, such as particles and dust, which may result in an increased contact resistance. The impurities in the lubricant may also result in a greater tendency of the lubricant to oxidise and thereby become less resistant.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1024" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">The object of the present invention is to provide an electric contact element having a contact layer with a low friction without the disadvantages mentioned above of such layers already known in connection with use and/or manufacture thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">This object is according to the invention obtained by providing such a contact element having a contact layer in the form of a continuous film comprising a laminated multielement material having strong bonds, such as covalent or metallic bonds, within each atomic layer and weaker bonds, through longer bonding distance or for example as van der Waals bonds or hydrogen bonds, between at least some adjacent atomic layers thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">It has turned out that a film of laminated material is excellent as a contact layer on a contact element in question for many reasons. The friction coefficient thereof is very low, typically 0.01-0.1. This is due to the fact that the atom layers are arranged alternatingly, e.g. when the material is MoS<sub>2 </sub>molybdenum and sulphur layers. The bonds between these layers are weak. Accordingly, when laminated material of this type comes into contact with another layer only the uppermost atom layer is sheared against the opposite surface of a said contact member resulting in a very low friction. Furthermore, said materials have low tendency to form oxides, which degrade electric contact to said contact member. Furthermore, said laminated materials have a low contact resistance to metallic surfaces. Furthermore, the materials are relatively chemical inert and stable at temperatures exceeding 400&#xb0; C. A material being laminated according to the invention, i.e. with strong bonds within each atomic layer and weak bonds between at least some adjacent atomic layers, may be called a nanolaminated material, since the thickness of the laminates so formed are in the region of 0.1 to 10 nanometers. &#x201c;multi-element&#x201d; indicates that the material is made of at least two elements, such as Mo and S, which distinguish it from graphite, which is a single-element material only containing C.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention said laminated material is MOS<sub>2</sub>, WS<sub>2 </sub>or a new class of layered ternary carbides and nitrides that can be described as M<sub>3</sub>AX<sub>2</sub>. M is a transition metal, A is a group A element (such as 3A and 4A) and X is either C or N. The class of materials is also denoted as 312 ceramics. The laminated material could also be H-phase materials M<sub>2</sub>BX, where M is a transition metal, B is a group B element and X is either C or N. These different materials have turned out to have the preferred features mentioned above.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">One of the laminated materials, Ti<sub>3</sub>SiC<sub>2</sub>, is especially preferred due to the excellent mechanical, chemical, electrical and thermal properties of the material.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">Accordingly, said laminar films are able to form a self lubricating, dry contact with a very low friction to another member, such as said contact member, which will also result in low operation forces facilitating interconnection of a contact element to another such contact element or contact member and/or results in less power losses in actuating members.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">According to different preferred embodiments of the invention laminar compounds of said film will have a morphology varying from amorphous to pure crystalline, and the morphology may be selected in accordance with the particular use of the contact element and/or the costs for producing the film. The films could also consist of fullerene-like nanoparticles, as described in Nature 387, 791 (1997) and Nature 407, 164 (2000). This preferred structural form shows excellent friction and wear properties. &#x201c;Nanoparticles&#x201d; is defined as particles having a size between 0.1 and 100 nm.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention laminar compounds of said film of laminated material is in the range of 0.001 &#x3bc;m to 1000 &#x3bc;m, and in a very preferred embodiment of the invention the thickness is less than 5 &#x3bc;m. Such thin layers may have a lifetime being nearly indefinite thanks to the very low friction of this material, so that in closed systems the result aimed at will be achieved through a very thin film having low costs of material and manufacturing process as a consequence thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention the thickness of said film of laminated material is above 10 &#x3bc;m. Such a thickness is preferred in the case of using such a film on a contact element in a contact arrangement where the contact element and the contact member are going to be moved with respect to each other, such as in a sliding contact, and accordingly not only moved by different coefficients of thermal expansion upon thermal cycling, such as when used on a slip ring in an electric rotating machine.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention said film comprises two sub-layers arranged on top of each other, namely one first sub-layer of laminated material and a second sub-layer of a harder material, such as CN<sub>x </sub>(carbon nitride). A combination of such a softer layer and a harder layer is very advantageous, since it will make it possible to obtain a good contact to said member coated with an oxide layer, because the hard material will ensure that the soft material will be pressed through the oxide layer for making said contact. The ductile laminated material will then make a larger contact area than would the hard material. CN<sub>x</sub>, is super-elastic and adheres well to the underlying substrate when said film is moved with respect to the contact member.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention the body deeper under said contact surface is made of a material being non-resistant to corrosion, and the material last mentioned is coated by a corrosion resistant material, such as nickel, adapted to receive said film on top thereof. It is preferred to proceed in this way, since the laminated film may have pores with a risk of corrosion of the underlying body material therethrough.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">Another object of the present invention is to provide sliding electric contact arrangement of the type defined in the introduction allowing a movement of two contact surfaces applied against each other while reducing the inconveniences discussed above to a large extent.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">This object is according to the invention obtained by providing such an arrangement with a contact element according to the present invention with said film arranged to form a dry contact with a very low friction, below 0.2, preferably below 0.1, to a contact member.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">The basic features and advantages of such a contact arrangement are associated with the characteristics of the contact element according to the present invention and appear from the discussion above of such a contact element. However, it is pointed out that &#x201c;sliding electric contact&#x201d; includes all types of arrangements making an electric contact between two members, which may move with respect to each other when the contact is established and/or interrupted and/or when the contact action is maintained. Accordingly, it includes not only contacts sliding along each other by action of an actuating member, but also so called stationary contacts having two contact elements pressed against each other and moving with respect to each other in the contacting state as a consequence of magneto-striction, thermal cycling and materials of the contact elements with different coefficients of thermal expansion or temperature differences between different parts of the contact elements varying over the time.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">A contact arrangement of the type last mentioned constitutes a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and the contact elements may for instance be pressed with a high pressure, preferably exceeding 1 MPa against each other without any mechanical securing means, but the contact elements may also be forced against each other by threaded screws or bolts.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">According to another preferred embodiment of the invention said contact arrangement is adapted to be arranged in an electric rotating machine, where the film comprising laminated material will result in a number of advantages. It is in particular possible to benefit from the low friction coefficient of the laminated material when arranging the contact element and the contact member of the contact arrangement on parts of the rotating machine moving with respect to each other, such as for instance the slip ring as a contact element and a contact element sliding there-upon. It will in this way be possible to replace the carbon brushes used in electric rotating machines by a contact element according to the present invention and a film of said type is then also preferably arranged on the moving part, such as a slip ring. Said carbon brushes have a number of disadvantages, such as a restricted lifetime, since the carbon is consumed. Furthermore, carbon dust is spread out on the winding and other parts of the machine, which may disturb the function thereof. It is preferred to have a thickness of the film of laminated material exceeding 10 &#x3bc;m for such a contact element, since also the film of laminated material will be consumed, but comparatively slowly, in this application thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">Electrical contact arrangements according to other preferred embodiments of the invention are different kinds of contacts having contact surfaces moving while bearing against each other in establishing and/or interrupting an electric contact, such as plug-in contacts or different types of spring-loaded contacts, in which it is possible to take advantage of the very low friction coefficient of laminated material resulting in a self-lubricating dry contact without the problems of lubricants such as oils or fats while making it possible to reduce the operation forces and save power consumed in actuating members.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">Electrical contact arrangements according to other preferred embodiments of the invention are as included in tap changers on transformers, where a low friction is a great advantage when the contact elements are sliding with their contact surfaces against each other, and in mechanical disconnectors and breakers and in relays. The inert character of the laminated material film may also be used in crimp contacts, then preferably with a body of a material being corrosion resistant or covered by a material having that feature, for instance nickel.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The invention also relates to a use of the contact arrangement according to any of the claims according to the invention relating to a contact arrangement, in which a probe for measuring and testing an integrated circuit is covered with a said laminated film avoiding chemical degradation and metal cladding on the probe. It is selfevident that this use according to the invention is very favourable, since it will make it possible to carry out measurements and testing without any interruptions for replacing or cleaning the probe.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">Further advantages as well as advantageous features appear from the following description and the other dependent claims.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1272" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a contact arrangement <b>1</b> of plug-in type, in which a contact surface <b>2</b> on a contact element <b>3</b> slides along and while bearing against contact surfaces <b>4</b> on another contact element <b>5</b>, here called contact member. The contact element <b>3</b> has a female character and is present in the form of a resilient jaw adapted to be connected to the male contact member <b>5</b> in the form of a contact rail. The contact element <b>3</b> is applied on the contact member <b>5</b> and bears in the contacting state while being biased by means of at least a contact surface <b>2</b> against a contact surface <b>4</b> on the contact member <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">At least one of the contact surfaces <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, preferably both, are provided with a continuous laminated film comprising MoS<sub>2</sub>, WS<sub>2 </sub>or a new class of layered ternary carbides and nitrides that can be described as M<sub>3</sub>AX<sub>2</sub>. M is a transition metal, A is a group A element (such as <b>3</b>A and <b>4</b>A) and X is either C or N. The class of materials is also denoted as <b>312</b> ceramics. The laminated material could also be H-phase materials M<sub>2</sub>BX, where M is a transition metal, B is a group B element and X is either C or N. This film may be very thin with a thickness in the range of 0.001 &#x3bc;m to 1000 &#x3bc;m and it will have a very low friction coefficient, typically 0.01 to 0.1. This means that the friction forces to be overcome when controlling the contact arrangement for establishing or interrupting the electric contact will be very low resulting in a low necessary power consumption in an actuating member and a nearly neglectible wear of the contact surfaces constituted by this film. Furthermore, the film is chemical inert and stable at temperatures exceeding 400&#xb0; C. It is pointed out that it is well possible that said continuous film is arranged on only the contact member <b>5</b>, which of course is a contact element just as the contact element <b>3</b>. Furthermore, in this case the film comprising laminated material is deposited and adheres to the body <b>6</b> of the contact element <b>3</b>, but in other preferred embodiments of the invention it is well possible that said film coats a body by being laid on top thereof as a separate foil. This may in particular be the case for the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> described further below.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The continuous film comprising laminated, or more exactly nanolaminated, material may be deposited on the body of the contact element, being preferably of Cu, by Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD), Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD), electro-chemically, or with thermal plasma spraying. It is preferred to provide a thin layer of a corrosion resistant material on the body before applying said film would the body be of a material being non-resistant to corrosion, since it is possible that the film will have some pores reaching therethrough.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a further example of a contact arrangement in which it is advantageous to coat at least one of the contact surfaces with a continuous film comprising laminated material for forming a self lubricating dry contact with a very low friction according to the present invention. This embodiment relates to a helical contact arrangement having a contact element <b>7</b> in the form of a spring-loaded annular body, such as a ring of a helically wound wire, adapted to establish and maintain an electric contact to a first contact member <b>8</b>, such as an inner sleeve or a pin, and a second contact member <b>9</b>, such as an outer sleeve or tube. The contact element <b>7</b> is in a contact state compressed so that at least a contact surface <b>10</b> thereof will bear spring-loaded against a contact surface <b>11</b> of the first contact member <b>8</b> and at least another contact surface <b>12</b> of the first contact element <b>7</b> will bear spring-loaded against at least a contact surface <b>13</b> of the second contact member <b>9</b>. According to this preferred embodiment of the invention at least one of a contact surfaces <b>10</b>-<b>13</b> is entirely or partially coated with a continuous low friction film comprising laminated material. Such a helical contact arrangement is used for example in an electrical breaker in a switch gear.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">An arrangement for making a good electric contact to a semi-conductor component <b>14</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but the different members arranged in a stack and pressed together with a high pressure, preferably exceeding 1 MPa and typically 6-8 MPa, are shown spaced apart for clarity. Each half of the stack comprises a pole piece <b>15</b> in the form of a Cu plate for making a connection to the semiconductor component. Each pole piece is provided with a thin continuous film <b>16</b> comprising laminated material. The coefficient of thermal expansion of the semiconductor material, for instance Si, SiC or diamond, of the semi-conductor component and of Cu differs a lot (2.2&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>/K for Si and 16&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>/K for Cu), which means that the Cu plates <b>15</b> and the semiconductor component <b>14</b> will move laterally with respect to each other when the temperature thereof changes. Contact arrangements of this type according to the stand of the art require for that sake one or several further members in said stack between the pole piece and the semiconductor component for taking care of this tendency to mutual movements upon thermal cycling for avoiding cracks in the semiconductor component and/or wear of the contact surface of said component. However, the very low friction of a film according to the present invention makes it possible to omit all these additional members and making the contact arrangement less costly, not at the least by allowing the use of a cheap material without any need of thermal matching close to the semiconductor component. A contact arrangement of this type is a part of a power electronic encapsulation <b>17</b> forming a closed system, and practically no material will be consumed when the film moves along the semiconductor component upon thermal cycling so that the lifetime thereof will be practically indefinite.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">A sliding contact arrangement according to another preferred embodiment of the invention is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as used in an electric rotating machine <b>18</b> of any type for establishing an electric contact between a slip ring <b>19</b> and a contact element <b>20</b>, which here replaces a carbon brush and is made of a body of for instance copper or aluminium coated with a continuous film <b>21</b> comprising laminated material. The outer surface of the slip ring <b>19</b> is preferably also coated by such a film indicated at <b>22</b>. This results in a very low friction electric contact having a low contact resistance. It would also be possible to use a contact arrangement having a continuous film of laminated material between two members moving with respect to each other in an electric rotating machine for avoiding a static electricity to be built up.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates very schematically how an electric contact arrangement according to the invention may be arranged in a disconnector <b>23</b> with a low friction film <b>24</b> comprising laminated material on at least one of the contact surfaces of two contact elements <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> movable with respect to each other for establishing an electric contact therebetween and obtaining a visible disconnection of the contact elements.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates schematically a sliding electric contact arrangement according to another preferred embodiment of the invention, in which the contact element <b>27</b> is a movable part of a tap changer <b>28</b> of a transformer adapted to slide in electric contact along contacts <b>29</b> to the secondary winding <b>35</b> of the transformer, accordingly forming the contact member, for tapping voltage of a level desired from said transformer. A low friction film <b>30</b> comprising laminated material is arranged on the contact surface of the contact element <b>27</b> and/or on the contact member <b>29</b>. The contact element <b>27</b> may in this way be easily moved along the contact member <b>29</b> while maintaining a low resistance contact thereto.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates very schematically a contact arrangement according to another preferred embodiment of the invention used in a relay <b>31</b>, and one or both of the contact surfaces of opposite contact elements <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> may be provided with a low friction film <b>34</b> comprising MoS<sub>2</sub>, which will result in less wear of the contact surfaces and make them corrosion resistant as a consequence of the character of laminated material.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">A contact element and a sliding electric contact arrangement according to the present invention may find many other preferred applications, and such applications would be apparent to a man with ordinary skill in the art without departing from the basic idea of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">It would for example be possible to dope the thin low friction film for improving friction, thermal, mechanical or electrical properties by one or several compounds. However, the amount of doping should not exceed 20 weight-% of the film. It is then also possible to have different films on different contact surfaces of the contact element and the contact member, for instance some doped and others not or some formed by at least two sub-layers and others having only one layer.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">Furthermore, the contact elements and arrangements of the invention are not restricted to any particular system voltages, but may be used in low, intermediate and high voltage applications.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="00047">The laminated material of the contact layer according to the invention may form an alloy together with 50-70% of a metal, for instance of Ti or Au, for improving the conductivity and reduce the absorption of moisture. This may take place by forming a homogeneous dispersion of the metal in the material or by arranging a layer of the chemical compound, such as MoS<sub>2 </sub>and a layer of the metal alternatingly.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e855" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">The present invention generally relates to measures to be taken to increase the noise immunity of a semiconductor device. More particularly, this invention relates to a technique of enhancing the noise immunity of a semiconductor device including not only an STI (shallow trench isolation) structure and a silicide diffused layer but also a dummy diffused layer for use in eliminating dishing, for example.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">In the past, a LOCOS isolation technique was often used to electrically isolate the active region of devices included in a semiconductor integrated circuit. Recently, however, an STI process is adopted more and more frequently to define even finer patterns. This tendency manifested itself when the design rule for LSIs reached 0.25 &#x3bc;m or 0.18 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">On the other hand, silicidation techniques have also been preferred lately. A silicidation technique is applicable to a process of forming a titanium or cobalt alloy layer, for example, on the upper surface of a diffused layer or a gate electrode. The silicidation was found effective because of several different reasons. Firstly, reduction in design rule for a semiconductor process has decreased the cross-sectional areas of diffused layer, gate electrode, contacts and so on. Accordingly, it is now much more necessary to reduce the parasitic resistance. Secondly, in forming a diode with a dual-gate structure, the gate electrodes of p- and n-channel transistors included in the diode should be &#x201c;backed&#x201d;. As used herein, &#x201c;backing&#x201d; means connecting a low-resistivity conductor in parallel to the electrode.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">It will be described in further detail why the &#x201c;backing&#x201d; is necessary.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">In processes for the devices in 5 to 3 V supply voltage generations, the p-channel transistor used to have a buried channel, the n-channel transistor a surface channel and the gate electrodes of these transistors used to be made of n-type polysilicon. However, a supply voltage for an LSI has been reduced at a tremendously high rate (e.g., at an interval of about two years) these days. Specifically, a supply voltage of 3.3 V, which was a commonplace around ten years ago, has been replaced with 2.5 V, 1.8 V, 1.5 V, and so on. Even though the supply voltage has been reduced this way, the drive current still should be kept high with the standby current minimized. To meet those needs, a dual-gate process is preferably performed so that the p-channel transistor, as well as the n-channel transistor, may also have a surface channel.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">To realize a dual-gate structure, however, the gate electrode of the n-channel transistor should be of n-type, while that of the p-channel transistor should be of p-type. Accordingly, a pn junction diode is unintentionally formed at the junction between the p- and n-type gates. Where such a diode exists between these transistors, a signal potential cannot change its level fully, thus making it very difficult to design an LSI normally.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">For that reason, a low-resistivity silicide interconnect is formed on the gate electrodes to &#x201c;back&#x201d; them. In that case, there is no need for the designer to provide any additional interconnection layer for the backing purposes during the layout stage. As a result, the efficiency of the design process improves. In addition, the silicidation also contributes to reducing a cell area and utilizing an interconnection layer much more efficiently. Accordingly, the majority of those skilled in the art now adopt the silicidation for a dual-gate process.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a schematic flow of a semiconductor device fabrication process including the steps of forming an STI structure and performing a silicidation process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A through 16G</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating schematic structures, corresponding to respective process steps for fabricating a semiconductor device, according to the flow illustrated in FIG. <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00010" num="00010">First, in Step S<b>11</b> of forming STI regions, parts of a silicon substrate <b>100</b>, where STI regions <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> will be defined, are etched to a predetermined depth by using a mask for defining diffused regions to form openings as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>B. Next, the openings are filled with a field oxide film <b>103</b> as a material for the STI regions <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>C. Then, excessive parts of the field oxide film <b>103</b>, existing over the filled parts, are removed by a CMP (chemical/mechanical polishing) process, thereby planarizing the surface of the substrate as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>D.</p>
<p id="P-00011" num="00011">A CMP polish pad usually has some elasticity. Accordingly, if there is any STI region <b>102</b> with a large area, then the field oxide film <b>103</b> existing in the region <b>102</b> might be partially removed excessively around its center. As a result, that part of the field oxide film <b>103</b> might have its height decreased by a level difference d as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>D. This unwanted phenomenon is called &#x201c;dishing&#x201d;, which is often observable in a CMP process. The level difference d created in this manner (which will be herein called a &#x201c;dishing level difference&#x201d;) will deform a pattern to be defined in a subsequent lithographic process because the depth of focus will be insufficient. In addition, the characteristics of the resultant transistor will also be affected eventually. To avoid these inconveniences, the dishing level difference d should be eliminated from the CMP process.</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">If a harder CMP polish pad is used, the dishing may be eliminated without modifying the flow of the fabrication process itself. However, it would be more effective to place a dummy diffused layer <b>105</b>, in which no source/drain electrodes will be actually formed for the transistor, in the STI region <b>102</b> with a large area at the layout stage. If the dummy diffused layer <b>105</b> is formed through the process steps illustrated on the right-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16B</figref>, <b>16</b>C and <b>16</b>D, then the polish pad will not be forced into the field oxide film <b>103</b> so strongly. As a result, the dishing level difference d can be substantially eliminated.</p>
<p id="P-00013" num="00013">Thereafter, in Step S<b>12</b>, a polysilicon gate electrode <b>106</b> is formed on the substrate <b>101</b> as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>E. Then, in Step S<b>13</b>, p- or n-type dopant ions <b>108</b> are implanted into the substrate <b>101</b> using a mask <b>107</b> to define source/drain regions as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>F. Subsequently, in Step S<b>14</b>, the diffused regions and polysilicon gate electrode <b>106</b> are covered with a silicide layer <b>109</b> as shown in FIG. <b>16</b>G. In this manner, all the process steps on the bulk portion of the wafer are finished. And then interconnects are formed in Step S<b>15</b>, thereby completing an LSI.</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">As described above, the dummy diffused layer is very effectively applicable to preventing the dishing phenomenon from occurring in forming the STI regions by a CMP process. The dummy diffused layer may also have beneficial effects on different types of processes (like lithographic and etching processes) other than the STI process. For example, to define a fine-line pattern for a diffused layer accurately by a lithographic process, the percentage of the area covered by the diffused layer to the area of a predetermined region may have to fall within a prescribed range in accordance with a process condition. In that situation, a dummy diffused layer may be have to be placed so that the area percentage of the diffused layer can fall within the prescribed range.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">However, through experiments and modeling, the present inventor found that a dummy diffused layer like that might unintentionally encourage the propagation of noise among circuit blocks as the case may be.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Now, it will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A through 19B</figref> how I found the problem to be solved by the present invention.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">Suppose an analog block <b>50</b> susceptible to noise and a digital block <b>51</b> operating at a high speed to generate a lot of noise should be formed on the same substrate as shown in FIG. <b>17</b>A. In that case, the analog block <b>50</b> is spaced way apart from the digital block <b>51</b> to reduce the noise propagated from the digital block <b>51</b> through a p-type substrate <b>52</b> by increasing the resistance formed by the substrate <b>52</b> with a p-well <b>53</b>. That is to say, an STI region <b>54</b> with a large area is defined between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">In an LSI, a sheet resistance of the p-well <b>53</b> is normally on the orders of several hundreds to several thousands &#x3a9;/&#x25a1;. Accordingly, by spacing the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> sufficiently apart from each other, the resistance formed by the p-type substrate <b>52</b> with the p-well <b>53</b> can be relatively high.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019">However, when the large-area STI region <b>54</b> is defined in a CMP process, the dishing might occur in the region <b>54</b> as described above. To avoid this unwanted phenomenon, a dummy diffused layer <b>55</b> may be inserted into the STI region <b>54</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>. Then, it is possible to prevent the dishing.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">Nevertheless, when another diffused layer and gate electrode have their surfaces turned into silicide alloys, this dummy diffused layer <b>55</b> also has its surface silicided. Thus, the dummy diffused layer <b>55</b> will have a two-layer structure in which a silicide layer <b>55</b><i>b </i>is formed over the remaining, non-alloyed part <b>55</b><i>a</i>. As a result, a low-impedance noise propagation path NZb, passing through the silicide layer <b>55</b><i>b </i>over the non-alloyed dummy diffused layer <b>55</b><i>a</i>, is newly made between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref> are circuit diagrams illustrating two models of the inter-block noise propagation path that correspond to the structures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17B and 18B</figref>, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> has only a noise propagation path NZa, passing through the p-type substrate <b>52</b> with the p-well <b>53</b>, between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>. And this noise propagation path NZa has a relatively high inter-block resistance R<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">In contrast, the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> has not only the noise propagation path NZa but also another noise propagation path NZb, passing through the silicide layer <b>55</b><i>b </i>over the dummy diffused layer <b>55</b><i>a</i>, between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> as shown in FIG. <b>19</b>B. Also, the resistance R<b>1</b> and another resistance R<b>2</b>, which is lower than the resistance R<b>1</b>, are connected in parallel between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>. The silicide layer <b>55</b><i>b </i>has a sheet resistance of approximately several &#x3a9;/&#x25a1;, whereas the p-well <b>53</b> has a sheet resistance of approximately several hundreds to several thousands &#x3a9;/&#x25a1;. Accordingly, the impedance values associated with these members <b>55</b><i>b </i>and <b>53</b> are different from each other by as much as two to three orders of magnitude.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">For that reason, even if the resistance R<b>1</b> formed by the p-type substrate <b>52</b> with the p-well <b>53</b> is much increased by spacing the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> far apart, the impedance between these blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> decreases considerably. This is because the resistance R<b>2</b>, formed by the backed silicide layer <b>55</b><i>b</i>, is connected in parallel between these blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">Accordingly, noise, generated by a VSS power supply DVSS for the digital block <b>51</b>, is propagated to the vicinity of the analog block <b>50</b> by way of the silicide layer <b>55</b><i>b</i>. Then, the noise passes through the p-type substrate <b>52</b> again to affect a VSS power supply AVSS for the analog block <b>50</b>. As a result, the analog block <b>50</b>, which is easily affected by noise, possibly operates erroneously or have its characteristics degraded.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">The silicided dummy diffused layer does not encourage the noise propagation just in the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, but may cause similar noise problems in semiconductor devices with various other structures. For example, noise might also be propagated in a similar manner between a pair of circuit blocks connected together by an n-well or even in a single block.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e1683" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">It is therefore an object of the present invention to enhance the noise immunity of a semiconductor device, including a dummy diffused layer on a substrate, by preventing the dummy diffused layer from encouraging the noise propagation.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">Specifically, an inventive semiconductor device includes: a substrate; a source/drain diffused layer formed in the substrate for a transistor; and a dummy diffused layer formed in the substrate. The source/drain diffused layer has its surface silicided. And the dummy diffused layer has its surface covered with an anti-silicidation film at least partially.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">According to the present invention, the dummy diffused layer is covered with the anti-silicidation film, and therefore is not silicided. Thus, part of the substrate with the dummy diffused layer can keep its impedance high. As a result, the noise immunity of the semiconductor device, including the dummy diffused layer, increases.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">In one embodiment of the present invention, the anti-silicidation film is preferably an oxide film. Generally speaking, an oxide film is easy to pattern into any desired shape by a normal semiconductor process. Accordingly, the inventive semiconductor device can be fabricated easily in that embodiment.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">In another embodiment of the present invention, a dopant, which has been introduced into the source/drain diffused layer, preferably has not been introduced into the dummy diffused layer. In such a case, the resistance of the dummy diffused layer is higher than that of the source/drain diffused layer. As a result, the noise immunity of the device further improves.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">Another inventive semiconductor device includes: a substrate; a source/drain diffused layer formed in the substrate for a transistor; and a dummy diffused layer formed in the substrate. The source/drain diffused layer has its surface silicided. The dummy diffused layer has its surface covered with a dummy gate electrode at least partially. The dummy gate electrode has the same structure as a gate electrode for the transistor.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">According to the present invention, the dummy diffused layer is covered with the dummy gate electrode, and therefore is not silicided. Thus, part of the substrate with the dummy diffused layer can keep its impedance high. As a result, the noise immunity of the semiconductor device including the dummy diffused layer increases. Furthermore, there is no need to add any extra process step to a normal fabrication process because the dummy gate electrode can be formed along with the normal gate electrode for the transistor.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">In this particular embodiment, the dummy diffused layer is preferably located between a circuit block and another circuit block, and the dummy gate electrode is preferably divided into at least two portions disposed between the two circuit blocks. In this embodiment, the dummy gate electrode has at least two separate portions disposed between the two circuit blocks, and therefore noise is much less likely propagated through the dummy gate electrode. As a result, the noise immunity of the device further improves.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">In still another embodiment, the dummy gate electrode preferably has a fixed potential level, because the noise will not be propagated through the dummy gate electrode so easily in that situation.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">In yet another embodiment, a dopant, which has been introduced into the source/drain diffused layer, preferably has not been introduced into the dummy diffused layer. In such a case, the resistance of the dummy diffused layer is higher than that of the source/drain diffused layer. As a result, the noise immunity of the device further improves.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">Still another inventive semiconductor device includes: a substrate; a source/drain diffused layer formed in the substrate for a transistor; and a dummy diffused layer formed in the substrate. The source/drain and dummy diffused layers have their surfaces silicided. A well of a first conductivity type is defined in the substrate. And the dummy diffused layer is formed in the well and a dopant of a second conductivity type, opposite to the first conductivity type, has been introduced into the dummy diffused layer.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">According to the present invention, the well of the first conductivity type and the dummy diffused layer, to which a dopant of the second conductivity type has been introduced, together forms a pn junction diode with a depletion-layer capacitance. Thus, in an electrical sense, the silicided surface of the dummy diffused layer is much less transparent to the substrate. As a result, the noise propagation is suppressible.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">In one embodiment of the present invention, the dummy diffused layer preferably has a fixed potential level. This is because even if AC noise is propagated through the pn junction diode, the noise is much less likely propagated through the silicided dummy diffused layer.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">More particularly, the potential level of the dummy diffused layer is preferably fixed at such a level as applying a reverse bias to a pn junction diode formed by the dummy diffused layer and the well. Then, the semiconductor device can have its noise immunity further increased.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">In still another embodiment, the dummy diffused layer may be divided into multiple portions. And those portions of the dummy diffused layer are preferably connected together by silicide diffused layer interconnects that have been formed in the same layer as the dummy diffused layer. In such an embodiment, the potential level of the dummy diffused layer can be fixed at a particular level just by connecting one of those portions of the dummy diffused layer to a metal interconnect. Accordingly, a metal interconnect layer over the dummy diffused layer can be used effectively. That is to say, the wire length can be reduced so that the performance of the device can be enhanced. Also, since a layout for the device can be made efficiently, the eventual device size (i.e., its area on the chip) can be reduced.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">Yet another inventive semiconductor device includes: a substrate of a first conductivity type; a source/drain diffused layer, which is formed in the substrate for a transistor and has its surface silicided; and a first well of a second conductivity type, which is formed in the substrate. The second conductivity type is opposite to the first conductivity type. The device further includes: a dummy diffused layer formed in the first well and located between two circuit blocks; and a second well of the first conductivity type, which is formed between the first well and one of the two circuit blocks.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">According to the present invention, a pn junction diode is formed around the dummy diffused layer by the substrate of the first conductivity type and the first well of the second conductivity type. If a well of the second conductivity type is defined to be closer to the dummy diffused layer in one of the two circuit blocks, then that well and the second well of the first conductivity type together forms another pn junction diode. Accordingly, even if the upper part of the dummy diffused layer has been silicided, an electrical path, originating from the substrate, should pass a depletion-layer capacitance of the pn junction diode. Thus, the noise is much less likely propagated. As a result, the semiconductor device, including the dummy diffused layer, can have its noise immunity increased.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043">In one embodiment of the present invention, potential levels of the first and second wells are preferably fixed at such levels as applying a reverse bias to a pn junction diode formed by the first and second wells. Then, the noise immunity of the device further improves.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1970" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="P-00063" num="00063">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="P-00064" num="heading-00064">Embodiment 1</p>
<p id="P-00065" num="00065">A first embodiment of the present invention is characterized by covering the surface of a dummy diffused layer with an anti-silicidation film to prevent the surface from being silicided.</p>
<p id="P-00066" num="00066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates respective process steps for fabricating a semiconductor device according to the first embodiment. In this embodiment, first, the steps S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b> and S<b>13</b> of defining STI regions, forming a gate electrode and implanting dopant ions into the substrate to define source/drain regions, respectively, are performed as in the known process. Then, before the silicidation step S<b>14</b> is carried out, the step S<b>20</b> of forming an anti-silicidation film is performed.</p>
<p id="P-00067" num="00067">In the illustrated embodiment, the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> are provided for the semiconductor device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>. Also, a twin well structure is adopted. Specifically, the device is designed to define an n-well in the surface region of a p-type substrate and then define a p-well by reversing the conductivity type of part of the n-well. As a result, the p-well is defined between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> as shown in FIG. <b>17</b>B. Furthermore, to prevent the dishing phenomenon from occurring in a CMP process, a dummy diffused layer is formed between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> to meet a predetermined design rule.</p>
<p id="P-00068" num="00068">Suppose the specifications of the analog block <b>50</b> require so high precision that noise, which is produced from the digital block <b>51</b> to affect the analog block <b>50</b>, should be as small as possible.</p>
<p id="P-00069" num="00069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the detailed processing flow of the step S<b>20</b> of forming an anti-silicidation film. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first, in Step S<b>21</b>, a film to be patterned into an anti-silicidation film is deposited over the entire surface of the substrate. Next, in Step S<b>22</b>, the surface of the film is coated with a resist film. Then, a masking pattern is defined in Step S<b>23</b> to cover respective regions where the anti-silicidation film should exist, and the resist film is exposed to some type of radiation in Step S<b>24</b>, thereby etching the film away except those masked regions in Step S<b>25</b>. In this manner, the anti-silicidation film is formed. In the illustrated embodiment, the anti-silicidation film is formed with the masking pattern defined to cover the surface of the dummy diffused layer entirely.</p>
<p id="P-00070" num="00070">After the anti-silicidation film has been formed this way, the silicidation step S<b>14</b> is performed. Accordingly, that part covered with the anti-silicidation film, or the surface of the dummy diffused layer, is not silicided. On the other hand, the other parts not covered with the anti-silicidation film, i.e., the surface of a diffused layer to be used as node electrodes for a transistor and the surface of the gate electrode, are silicided, because silicon is exposed on those surfaces. In this manner, the silicide layer can be selectively formed only in desired regions.</p>
<p id="P-00071" num="00071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are respectively a plan view, and a cross-sectional view taken along the line IIIb&#x2014;IIIb shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, illustrating a structure for a semiconductor device fabricated by the process of the first embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the analog block <b>50</b> includes p- and n-wells <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b </i>as a source/drain diffused layer for a transistor, while the digital block <b>51</b> also includes n- and p-wells <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>as another source/drain layer for another transistor.</p>
<p id="P-00072" num="00072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b>, formed between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>, has its surface covered with the anti-silicidation film <b>12</b> and has not been silicided. Accordingly, the backed silicide resistor, which is formed by siliciding the dummy diffused layer <b>55</b><i>b </i>in the known device, does not exist between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> of the inventive device. As a result, the inter-block impedance can be kept high. That is to say, this embodiment provides an effective countermeasure against the noise possibly propagated between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00073" num="00073">The anti-silicidation film <b>12</b> is preferably an oxide film, because an oxide film <b>12</b> can be formed or shaped easily. Alternatively, the film <b>12</b> may also be a nitride film.</p>
<p id="P-00074" num="00074">Generally speaking, the step of forming an anti-silicidation film is often prepared for a normal silicidation process to provide an analog resistor or a resistor for realizing electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection. In that case, the process step of forming the anti-silicidation film to increase the noise immunity according to this embodiment may be performed along with the prepared process step. Thus, this embodiment is implementable without newly adding any process step.</p>
<p id="P-00075" num="00075">It should be noted that when dopant ions are implanted into parts of the substrate to be source/drain regions or pocket doped regions, no ions may be implanted into the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00076" num="00076">Should a p-type dopant have been introduced into the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> formed over the p-well <b>53</b> in the step S<b>13</b> of defining source/drain regions by ion implantation, the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> will have a sheet resistance lower than that of the p-well <b>53</b>. In such a situation, even though silicidation is avoidable due to the existence of the anti-silicidation film <b>12</b>, the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> much more likely propagates the noise. Accordingly, where no ions are implanted into the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> in the step S<b>13</b>, the sheet resistance of the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> can be kept high enough, thus increasing the inter-block impedance. As a result, the noise propagation can be further suppressed.</p>
<p id="P-00077" num="00077">The surface of the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> does not have to be covered with the anti-silicidation film entirely but just partially. This is because those covered portions are not silicided and the noise propagation still can be suppressed sufficiently.</p>
<p id="P-00078" num="heading-00078">Embodiment 2</p>
<p id="P-00079" num="00079">A second embodiment of the present invention is characterized by covering the surface of a dummy diffused layer with a dummy gate electrode, having the same structure as the gate electrode of a transistor, to prevent the surface of the dummy diffused layer from being silicided. That is to say, the fabrication process of the second embodiment does not include the step S<b>20</b> of forming an anti-silicidation film unlike the first embodiment. Instead, in the step S<b>12</b> of forming a gate electrode, a dummy gate electrode, covering the dummy diffused layer, is formed along with a gate electrode for a transistor.</p>
<p id="P-00080" num="00080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are respectively a plan view, and a cross-sectional view taken along the line IVb&#x2014;IVb shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, illustrating a structure for a semiconductor device according to the second embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, a polysilicon gate electrode <b>13</b> has been formed as a dummy gate electrode to cover the surface of a dummy diffused layer <b>11</b>. In such a structure, the dummy gate electrode <b>13</b>, formed over the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b>, is silicided in the silicidation step S<b>14</b>. Accordingly, the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> itself is not silicided. Also, a gate oxide film <b>14</b> is interposed between the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> and dummy gate electrode <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00081" num="00081">The dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> and the gate electrode for a transistor can be formed at a time. Accordingly, this embodiment is implementable without newly adding any extra process step. In the step S<b>13</b> of forming the gate electrodes, the dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> should preferably be formed to afford a sufficient overlay margin, because some error is inevitable when a diffused layer mask and a gate electrode mask are overlaid on, and aligned with, each other.</p>
<p id="P-00082" num="00082">Also, where the dummy gate electrode is formed as a countermeasure against noise as is done in this embodiment, the percentage of a chip area actually covered by the gate electrodes might be different from the originally designed one. This is because the designer of the device normally does not expect the addition of the dummy gate electrode. The gate area percentage is one of critical factors determining the resultant characteristic of a semiconductor device. Accordingly, if the difference in gate area percentage seriously affects the characteristic of the device, then the anti-silicidation film of the first embodiment is preferred to the dummy gate electrode of the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="P-00083" num="00083">The surface of the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> does not have to be covered with the dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> entirely but just partially. This is because those covered parts are not silicided and the noise propagation still can be suppressed sufficiently.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e2555" level="1">Modified Example of Embodiment 2</heading>
<p id="P-00084" num="00084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> is not silicided due to the existence of the dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> covering the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b>. For that reason, the noise propagation path, passing through the silicided dummy diffused layer <b>55</b><i>b </i>as described for the background, cannot exist.</p>
<p id="P-00085" num="00085">In this case, however, another type of noise propagation path NZ<b>2</b> might exist. Specifically, a coupling capacitor is formed by the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b>, gate oxide film <b>14</b> and dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> to pass noise from the digital block <b>51</b> to the dummy gate electrode <b>13</b>. The dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> is a silicided low resistor and is also a floating node with no fixed potential level. Accordingly, the noise is propagated to the vicinity of the analog block <b>50</b>. Another coupling capacitor is formed by the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b>, gate oxide film <b>14</b> and dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> around the analog block <b>50</b>. As a result, the noise is eventually propagated to the p-type substrate <b>52</b> to reach the analog block <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00086" num="00086">By ameliorating the second embodiment, this modified example cuts this additional noise propagation path NZ<b>2</b> off.</p>
<p id="P-00087" num="00087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are respectively a plan view, and a cross-sectional view taken along the line Vb&#x2014;Vb shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, illustrating a structure for a semiconductor device according to a modified example of the second embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> has been divided into a number of parts <b>11</b><i>a </i>along a path running from the digital block <b>51</b> (i.e., a noise source block) toward the analog block <b>50</b> that should not be affected by the noise. The dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> has also been divided into the same number of parts <b>13</b><i>a </i>covering the associated parts <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b>. That is to say, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> exists intermittently between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> (which are equivalent to two circuit blocks as defined in the claims). Accordingly, the noise propagation path NZ<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is not made anymore.</p>
<p id="P-00088" num="00088">The effects of this modified example are also attainable by dividing only the dummy gate electrode <b>13</b>, not the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00089" num="00089">In actually laying out circuit components on a chip, this countermeasure should be taken two-dimensionally for surrounding blocks.</p>
<p id="P-00090" num="00090">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, those divided parts <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> are arranged in lines between an analog block <b>60</b> and respective noise source blocks <b>61</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, each set of parts <b>11</b><i>a </i>extends vertically to an associated path between the analog block <b>60</b> and associated one of the noise source blocks <b>61</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> on the other hand, square or polygonal parts <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> are arranged in columns and rows to form an array. In inserting an additional pattern into a device being designed manually, the linear pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is preferred, because this patterns is much simpler and requires a far less data quantity. However, where a pattern should be inserted automatically using some CAD tool for the physical layout process, the regular array pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is easier to add.</p>
<p id="P-00091" num="00091">For the second embodiment of the present invention, the gate electrodes are made of polysilicon and the gate electrodes and the diffused layer are both silicided in the step S<b>14</b>. Alternatively, the gate electrodes may be made of any other non-silicidable material, e.g., polycide or poly-metal. In that case, only the diffused layer is silicided but the gate electrodes are not in the silicidation process step. However, the dummy diffused layer is not silicided, either, because the dummy gate electrode exists.</p>
<p id="P-00092" num="heading-00092">Embodiment 3</p>
<p id="P-00093" num="00093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are respectively a plan view, and a cross-sectional view taken along the line VIIb&#x2014;VIIb shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, illustrating a structure for a semiconductor device according to a third embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, a dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> is made up of a non-silicided silicon layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>and a silicided layer <b>14</b><i>b</i>. An n-type dopant has been introduced into the silicon layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>by an ion implantation process. That is to say, the n-type (e.g., a second conductivity type) dopant has been introduced into the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> that was formed over a p-type (e.g., a first conductivity type) well <b>53</b>. The dopant ions may be implanted into the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> by using an n-type dopant ion implantation mask <b>21</b> as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>A.</p>
<p id="P-00094" num="00094">If the n-type dopant has been introduced this way into the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> over the p-well <b>53</b>, then the n-type doped silicon layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>is formed under the silicided layer <b>14</b><i>b </i>resulting from the subsequent silicidation (or alloy) process. And a pn junction diode is formed by the p-well <b>53</b> and n-type doped silicon layer <b>14</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="P-00095" num="00095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph illustrating the voltage-current characteristic of the diode. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, even when a voltage Vpn is applied to the diode, almost no current Ipn flows and the diode behaves like a capacitor around the origin of this graph. In fact, the pn diode actually formed has a structure similar to a capacitor including a depletion layer as its insulator. And this pn diode exists on a path leading to the silicided layer <b>14</b><i>b </i>as the upper part of the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b>. Accordingly, a noise propagation path passing through the silicided layer <b>14</b><i>b </i>is much less transparent to the digital block <b>51</b>, i.e., the noise source, and to the p-type substrate <b>52</b> and p-well <b>53</b> adjacent to the block <b>51</b>. Thus, even if the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> has been partially silicided, it is still possible to prevent the noise from being propagated through the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> by introducing a dopant of n-type, opposite to that of the p-well <b>53</b>, into the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00096" num="00096">Also, where a dummy diffused layer <b>15</b> has been formed over an n-well <b>55</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a pn junction diode can also be formed in a similar manner by introducing a p-type dopant into the dummy diffused layer <b>15</b>. Accordingly, even if the dummy diffused layer <b>15</b> has been partially silicided, no noise will be propagated, either, by way of that dummy diffused layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00097" num="00097">The process step of implanting dopant ions into the dummy diffused layer may be performed as an additional process step if necessary. However, it is more preferable to carry out this process step along with the process step of implanting dopant ions into the substrate to define source/drain regions for a transistor. This is because this embodiment is implementable without newly adding any extra process step, and that would be more cost effective.</p>
<p id="P-00098" num="00098">Optionally, the third embodiment may be combined with the first embodiment. That is to say, a dopant may be introduced into the dummy diffused layer first, and then the anti-silicidation film may be formed thereon. Alternatively, the third embodiment is combinable with the second embodiment. In that case, however, the process step of implanting dopant ions into the dummy diffused layer should be performed separately from the process step of implanting dopant ions to define source/drain regions for a transistor. The reason is as follows. Specifically, source/drain regions for a transistor are normally defined by dopant ion implantation after a gate electrode has been formed. Accordingly, even if the dopant is tentatively introduced into the dummy diffused layer when the dopant is introduced to define the source/drain regions, the dopant is blocked by the dummy gate electrode and cannot reach the dummy diffused layer. For that reason, where the third and second embodiments are combined, the dopant should be introduced into the dummy diffused layer before the gate electrode is formed.</p>

<p id="P-00101" num="00101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, a dummy diffused layer <b>16</b> is surrounded by an n-well <b>55</b> (i.e., a first well of a second conductivity type). To suppress the noise propagation, another pair of wells of a first conductivity type, or p-wells <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b</i>, are additionally provided between the n-well <b>55</b> and the n-well <b>50</b><i>b </i>of the analog block <b>50</b> and between the n-well <b>55</b> and the n-well <b>51</b><i>a </i>of the digital block <b>51</b>, respectively. In the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>, each well <b>50</b><i>b </i>or <b>51</b><i>a</i>, located closer to the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b>, is of n-type. Accordingly, to block the noise propagation, the p-wells <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b </i>are inserted between the n-well <b>55</b>, including the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b>, and the surrounding blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00102" num="00102">In such a structure, a pn junction diode is formed by the p-type substrate <b>52</b> and n-well <b>55</b> at the bottom of the region between the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b> and p-type substrate <b>52</b>.

<p id="P-00103" num="00103">As already described for the third embodiment, each of the pn junction diodes thus formed blocks the noise propagation between the regions adjacent to the diode.

<p id="P-00104" num="00104">As can be seen, according to the fourth embodiment, the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b> is provided to eliminate the dishing phenomenon from a CMP process, and yet no noise will be propagated through the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b>.</p>

<p id="P-00107" num="00107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a plan view illustrating a structure for a semiconductor device according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention. The device of the fifth embodiment is a modification to the device of the second embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the dummy gate electrode <b>13</b>, covering the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b>, is connected to a metal interconnect <b>31</b> via a contact <b>32</b>, and has its potential level fixed at either supply voltage level or ground level.</p>
<p id="P-00108" num="00108">As already described for the second embodiment, when the dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> is formed to cover the surface of the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b> is not be silicided. However, the dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> is a silicided low resistor and is also a floating node with no fixed potential level. Accordingly, noise might be propagated through a coupling capacitor formed by the dummy diffused layer <b>11</b>, gate oxide film <b>14</b> and dummy gate electrode <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00109" num="00109">Generally speaking, any capacitor, including an insulator sandwiched between two conductors, becomes a signal-transmitting conductor responsive to an AC signal, in particular. That is to say, the following equation
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
tells us that where the voltage V is variable with time, the greater the capacitance C, the larger the amount of current I flowing.
</p>
<p id="P-00113" num="00113">Thus, according to the fifth embodiment, the dummy gate electrode <b>13</b> has its potential level fixed at either supply voltage level or ground level to be supplied through the metal interconnect <b>31</b> as shown in FIG. <b>11</b>. In this manner, the capacitor, consisting of the diffused layer, oxide film and gate electrode, can have one of its electrodes fixed at a potential level. As a result, the propagation of noise, or AC signal, in particular, between the analog and digital blocks <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> is suppressible. Consequently, the noise immunity of the semiconductor device improves.</p>

<p id="P-00115" num="00115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a plan view illustrating a structure for a semiconductor device according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention. The device of the sixth embodiment is a modification to the device of the third embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b>, including the silicided upper part <b>14</b><i>b</i>, is connected to metal interconnects <b>33</b> via contacts <b>34</b>, and has its potential level fixed at a supply voltage level VDD.</p>
<p id="P-00116" num="00116">As described for the third embodiment, the n-type dopant is introduced into the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> over the p-well <b>53</b> to form a pn junction diode between the p-well <b>53</b> and n-type doped silicon layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>B. Thus, even if the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> is partially silicided, a noise propagation path, passing through the silicided layer <b>14</b><i>b</i>, is much less transparent to the digital block <b>51</b> (i.e., the noise source) and to the p-type substrate <b>52</b> and p-well <b>53</b> adjacent to the digital block <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00117" num="00117">In the sixth embodiment, the n-type doped dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> has its potential level fixed so that the pn junction diode, formed by the p-well <b>53</b> and dummy diffused layer <b>14</b>, is reverse biased. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> is connected via the contacts <b>34</b> and metal interconnects <b>33</b> to a VDD power supply. As a result, the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> has its potential level fixed at the supply voltage level and a reverse bias is applied to the pn junction diode formed by the p-well <b>53</b> and dummy diffused layer <b>14</b>. Consequently, the noise immunity of the semiconductor device further improves compared to the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="P-00118" num="00118">Following is the supplementary reason why the noise immunity improves when a reverse bias is applied to the pn junction diode.</p>
<p id="P-00119" num="00119">In general, when a reverse bias is applied to a pn diode, a depletion layer expands around the pn junction. For a capacitor including two conductors and one insulator sandwiched between them, the expansion of the depletion layer means that the insulator thickens to increase the distance between the two conductors.</p>
<p id="P-00120" num="00120">As is well known from the following equation
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>C=&#x3b5;&#xd7;S </i>(area of conductor)/<i>d</i>(thickness of insulator)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
the capacitance decreases as the depletion layer expands.
</p>
<p id="P-00123" num="00123">Accordingly, as can be seen from the equation cited for the fifth embodiment,
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Q=C&#xb7;V</i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x2234;d<i>Q</i>/dt=<i>I=C</i>&#xb7;dV/dt<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
even if the voltage variation dV/dt is the same, the noise I to be propagated is in proportion to the capacitance C. Thus, as the depletion layer thickens, the noise propagated decreases.
</p>
<p id="P-00127" num="00127">This is why the noise immunity further improves if a voltage is applied as is done in the sixth embodiment so that the pn diode, formed by the well and dummy diffused layer, is reverse biased. The same approach is also applicable to a situation where a p-type doped dummy diffused layer is formed in an n-well. In that case, the dummy diffused layer should be connected to a ground line VSS so that the resultant pn diode is reverse biased.</p>
<p id="P-00128" num="00128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a plan view illustrating a structure for another semiconductor device according to the sixth embodiment. In the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> is divided into multiple portions, which are connected together via a diffused layer interconnect <b>35</b>. The diffused layer interconnect <b>35</b> also functions as a dummy diffused layer by itself. Furthermore, the diffused layer interconnect <b>35</b> is also silicided along with the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> in the silicidation process step. Accordingly, the sheet resistance of the diffused layer interconnect <b>35</b> is not so low as that of the metal interconnect but is relatively low, i.e., on the order of several &#x3a9;Q/&#x25a1;. And those multiple portions of the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> are connected together by this diffused layer interconnect <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00129" num="00129">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the metal interconnects <b>33</b> for fixing the potential level are included in a metallization layer over the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> on the other hand, the metallization layer over the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> is used only partially (i.e., around a contact <b>37</b>) for fixing the potential level. That is to say, most of the metallization layer over the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> is available for metal interconnects for other purposes. Accordingly, even the interconnects, which should make a detour around the interconnects <b>33</b> over the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b> or are included in an even higher-level layer in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, can be formed in the metallization layer just over the dummy diffused layer <b>14</b>. For example, an interconnect <b>38</b> can be formed as shown in FIG. <b>13</b>. Consequently, the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> contributes to performance enhancement by shortening the wire length and to downsizing by increasing the efficiency of the layout process.</p>

<p id="P-00131" num="00131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> are respectively a plan view, and a cross-sectional view taken along the line XIVb&#x2014;XIVb shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, illustrating a structure for a semiconductor device according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention. The seventh embodiment is a modification to the fourth embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>. Specifically, in the seventh embodiment, the n-well <b>55</b>, surrounding the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b>, has its potential level fixed at the supply voltage level VDD, while the p-wells <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b </i>and p-type substrate <b>52</b>, surrounding the n-well <b>55</b>, have their potential levels fixed at the ground level VSS.</p>
<p id="P-00132" num="00132">As already described for the fourth embodiment, a pn junction diode is formed by the p-type substrate <b>52</b> and n-well <b>55</b> at the bottom of the region between the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b> and p-type substrate <b>52</b> as shown in FIG. <b>10</b>B. In addition, two more pn junction diodes are formed by the p-wells <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b </i>and n-well <b>55</b> at the right- and left-hand ends of that region. That is to say, these three pn junction diodes together forms a &#x201c;receptacle&#x201d; for the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00133" num="00133">In the seventh embodiment, the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> is modified in such a manner as to further increase the noise immunity thereof. Specifically, the potential level of the n-well <b>55</b> is fixed at the supply voltage level VDD and the potential levels of the p-wells <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b </i>and p-type substrate <b>52</b> are fixed at the ground level VSS. Then, a reverse bias is applied to not only the pn junction diode formed by the p-type substrate <b>52</b> and n-well <b>55</b> but also to the pn junction diodes formed by the p-wells <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b </i>and n-well <b>55</b>. Consequently, the noise immunity of the semiconductor device improves as described for the sixth embodiment.</p>
<p id="P-00134" num="00134">The p-wells <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b</i>, located on the right- and left-hand sides of the n-well <b>55</b>, are electrically connected to the p-type substrate <b>52</b>. Accordingly, if it is difficult to fix the potential levels of those p-wells <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b</i>, then the wells <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b </i>may be opened. But the potential levels of these wells <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b </i>are preferably fixed using metal interconnects <b>41</b>, because the noise can be eliminated with much more certainty.</p>
<p id="P-00135" num="00135">In the seventh embodiment, an n-type dopant should be introduced into a part <b>43</b> of the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b> that will be used as a substrate contact for fixing the potential level of the n-well <b>55</b>. Also, a p-type dopant should be introduced into respective parts <b>44</b> of the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b> that will be used as substrate contacts for fixing the potential levels of the p-wells <b>56</b><i>a </i>and <b>56</b><i>b</i>. However, it is not always necessary to introduce a dopant into the other portions of the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b>. This is because the pn diode exists between the p-type substrate <b>52</b> and n-well <b>55</b> as viewed from the p-type substrate <b>52</b>. Nevertheless, it is more preferable to introduce the p-type dopant into the remaining portions <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the dummy diffused layer <b>16</b>, other than the substrate contacts, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> so that two more pn diodes are formed between the n-well <b>55</b> and dummy diffused layer <b>16</b><i>a</i>. Then, the silicided layer <b>16</b><i>b </i>is even less transparent to the p-type substrate <b>52</b> and the noise immunity of the device further improves.</p>
<p id="P-00136" num="00136">A semiconductor device according to the present invention does not have to be fabricated by the method exemplified for the foregoing embodiments, but may be made by any of various other methods. Also, numerous parameters for the dummy diffused layer, including pattern size and shape, insertion pitch and percentage of the area covered by the diffused layer on the chip, are changeable depending on the specific type of the process apparatus used, process conditions and the components laid out around the device. Furthermore, the process conditions that should be met for the dummy diffused layer are fixed. Accordingly, to save the designer's time and trouble, after the layout process is finished, the dummy diffused layer may be inserted automatically when design data is subjected to computer processing using a CAD tool.</p>
<p id="P-00137" num="00137">As described for the background of the invention, the dummy diffused layer is not formed just for eliminating the dishing phenomenon from an STI-CMP process. For example, the dummy diffused layer may be formed to adjust the percentage of the area covered in view of etching and lithographic processes. Even if the dummy diffused layer is formed for any other purpose, not as a countermeasure against dishing, the dummy diffused layer also has its resistance decreased and also propagates the inter-block noise unintentionally when silicided. Accordingly, the present invention is also effectively applicable to the dummy diffused layer formed for any of those other purposes.</p>
<p id="P-00138" num="00138">Furthermore, the inconveniences are not caused by the noise just between the digital and analog blocks. For example, super-high-speed interface I/O ports, which have been in higher and higher demand these days, might be non-negligible noise sources. Also, to meet the demand for processes defined by an even smaller design rule and for reduction in power dissipated by various units, the logic section and memory block often need to operate at an even lower voltage applied. Generally speaking, as the operating voltage decreases, the margin affordable against the noise shrinks. Accordingly, the inter-block noise is apt to affect the logic section or memory block more and more seriously. For that reason, the present invention is also effectively applicable to a noise problem like this.</p>
<p id="P-00139" num="00139">As is apparent from the foregoing description, the present invention suppresses the noise propagation by covering a dummy diffused layer with a dummy gate electrode or by surrounding the dummy diffused layer with pn junction diodes. Thus, the present invention improves the noise immunity of a semiconductor device including the dummy diffused layer.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1118" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">This invention relates generally to avalanche photodiodes and, more particularly, to an avalanche photodiode (APD) for use in harsh environments, such as oil well drilling applications, wherein the avalanche photodiode comprises silicon carbide (SiC) materials or gallium nitride (GaN) materials.</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">There is currently a need for gamma ray detection in the oil well drilling industry. High energy gamma rays reflected from Hydrogen (H) bearing compounds underground may indicate specific locations which may have oil. A small, robust sensor capable of detecting such rays is highly desirable and necessary for harsh, down-hole environments where shock levels are near 250 gravitational acceleration (G) and temperatures approach or exceed 150&#xb0; Celsius (C).</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">Several current technologies utilize photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to transform low-level ultraviolet (UV) light signals to readable level electronic signals. However, PMTs have a negative temperature coefficient. Thus, PMTs become less sensitive as temperature increases. PMTs are also fragile and prone to fail when vibration levels are high. For certain applications (e.g., at 150&#xb0; C. where PMTs have &#x2dc;50% signal), the lifetimes of PMTs may become prohibitively short, thereby driving the cost of their use up sharply. Another problem faced by PMTs involves high noise levels, which make accurate signal detection increasingly difficult.</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">APDs are high-speed, high sensitivity photodiodes utilizing an internal gain mechanism that functions by applying a reverse voltage. Compared to PIN photodiodes, APDs can measure even lower level light and are used in a wide variety of applications requiring high sensitivity. Silicon may be used in APDs due to its very high ionization coefficient ratio, which results in a high-gain bandwidth product and very low excess noise. However, silicon has a very low absorption coefficient especially at a fiber-optic and free-space optical communications wavelengths at 1.3 microns and 1.5 microns. An advantage of using silicon for a multiplication region within an ADP is due to a high ionization coefficient ratio, which results in much higher sensitivity, higher-gain bandwidth product, lower noise and higher temperature and voltage stability.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">Other conventional APDs may include near-infrared indium gallium arsenide/indium phosphide (InGaAs/InP) APDs that are limited in performance by a small ionization coefficient ratio, which results in low-gain bandwidth product and high excess noise. At shorter wavelengths, silicon (Si) APDs are used extensively for applications where high sensitivity and high-gain bandwidth product are required.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">Conversely, silicon is likely not to perform well at high temperatures and high vibration environments. Silicon has inherent disadvantages which preclude its ease of use and implementation in many applications. More specifically, Si-based devices suffer largely from degradation when exposed to harsh environments or temperatures above 150 degrees Celsius. Complex, expensive cooling systems and packages are required to facilitate successful operation of Si-based APDs, limiting their wide spread use in harsh environment applications.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">These and other drawbacks exist in current systems and techniques.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e1277" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">An aspect of the present invention is directed to an avalanche photodiode (APD) device for use in oil well drilling applications in harsh, down-hole environments where shock levels are near 250 gravitational acceleration (G) and/or temperatures approach or exceed 150&#xb0; C. Another aspect of the present invention is directed to an APD device fabricated using SiC materials. Another aspect of the present invention is directed to an APD device fabricated using GaN materials. An avalanche photodiode is a photodiode that operates with a reverse bias voltage that causes a primary photocurrent to undergo amplification by cumulative multiplication of charge carriers. As the reverse-bias voltage increases toward a breakdown, hole-electron pairs are created by absorbed photons. An avalanche effect occurs when the hole-electron pairs acquire sufficient energy to create additional pairs of holes and electrons, thereby achieving a signal gain.</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">Epitaxial layers of specific qualities (e.g., doping and thickness) determine operating characteristics (e.g., an avalanche voltage) of devices (e.g., photodiodes) as well as the gain, which is vital to successful operation. Ionization coefficients in 4H, which is a specific crystalline phase of SiC, have a positive temperature coefficient, which is particularly attractive for a SiC photodiode due to the requirement of ionization in an avalanche process. 4H SiC is a material with a wide band gap (&#x2dc;3.2 eV) and a robust chemical nature. This material can absorb UV light rays. Due at least in part to the wide band gap, the device of an embodiment of the present invention may operate at high temperatures. The device further uses a p-n junction, via the n-type epitaxial layers and the p-type substrate. This may be a location for avalanche once a high reverse bias has been applied to the device.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">According to another embodiment of the present invention, a GaN based APD may be implemented for oil well drilling applications. GaN is a material with a wide band gap (3.4 eV) and a robust chemical nature. This material can absorb UV light rays. The GaN APD of the present invention implements a substrate comprising sapphire or bulk GaN with various epitaxial layers grown on top of the substrate. The GaN APD makes use of a p-n junction at high applied voltages to initialize an electrical avalanche or breakdown, near an intended operation point of the device. The electrical field required in this type of device is on the order of a few MeV/cm and is made possible via a depletion region internal to the device and a large external bias.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the device may include a silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) passivation layer for providing surface passivation. This SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer may also serve as an anti-reflection coating, thereby increasing light collection efficiency and overall detection efficiency of the APD device. In addition, a phosphorous silicate glass (PSG) layer may be deposited on the device to control electrical properties otherwise affected by mobile ions. For example, a PSG layer may be provided to prevent mobile ions from moving throughout the device and lowering device performance. Protective layers of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and PSG provide surface passivation and mobile ion trapping, allowing faster and more efficient device operation while extending the lifetime of the device. In addition, methods for metallization may be used to provide low resistance contacts.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">A goal of an APD of an embodiment of the present invention involves detecting low levels of ultraviolet (UV) photons from scintillators (or other devices) excited by gamma rays and transforming a signal to an electrical signal. The APD of an embodiment of the present invention may be used specifically in harsh (e.g., high vibration, high temperature, etc.) environments, requiring robust materials. An aspect of the present invention is directed to an n-p type APD rather than a p-n type device, which is more difficult to realize given its high sensitivity to material defects. The APD device of the present invention may operate within a breakdown region of the SiC semiconductor material (e.g., 1-3 MeV/cm).</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example of a cross sectional view of an avalanche photodiode device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cross-section of the APD device with a substrate <b>110</b>, a first epitaxial layer <b>111</b>, a second epitaxial layer <b>112</b> and a third epitaxial layer <b>114</b>.

The plurality of epitaxial layer may be grown on the substrate for the formation of a desired electric field profile as a function of depth in the material. The first epitaxial layer <b>111</b> may serve to terminate defects at a substrate/epitaxial layers interface as well as form a p-n junction. The second epitaxial layer <b>112</b> may serve to allow for a relatively large penetration depth of UV photons, thereby increasing a probability for absorption and carrier generation events. The third epitaxial layer <b>114</b> may provide a low resistance contact to a cathode. This configuration may also serve to confine a high electrical field away from a surface of the device and near the p-n junction and further control a field profile in a manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> discussed below.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the substrate <b>110</b> may include a p-doped 4H SiC substrate, the first epitaxial layer <b>112</b> may include a p-doped 4H SiC layer, the second epitaxial layer <b>112</b> may include an n-doped 4H SiC layer and the third epitaxial layer <b>114</b> may include an n-doped SiC layer. More specifically, dopant concentration for substrate <b>110</b> may be approximately 5e18 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>; dopant concentration for the first epitaxial layer <b>111</b> may be approximately 1e17 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, dopant concentration for second epitaxial layer <b>112</b> may be approximately 5e16 cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to 6e16 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>; and dopant concentration for second epitaxial layer <b>114</b> may be approximately 5e18 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>.

Other measurements may be implemented as well. For example, the first epitaxial layer <b>111</b> may have a thickness of 0.2 to 5 microns with a preferred range of 1 to 2 microns. The second epitaxial layer <b>112</b> may have a thickness to facilitate absorption and may range from 2 to 10 microns with a preferred range of 3 to 5 microns. The third epitaxial layer <b>114</b> may have a thickness of 0.1 to 2 microns with a preferred range of 0.3 to 0.8 microns.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">Metal electrodes <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> may comprise a combination of various metals. In particular, metal electrode <b>118</b> may include Ni/Ti/Mo/Au at a cathode end. Metal electrode <b>120</b> may include Al/Ti/Pt/Au at an anode end. Thin metal layers may be used to form electrodes to both p and n contacts while maintaining a low resistance and minimizing or eliminating a drop in electric field. Other materials providing an ohmic contact may be used. Passivation layers <b>116</b> and <b>122</b> may comprise SiO<sub>2</sub>, which may have a thickness of 100 Angstroms to several microns (e.g., approximately 5 microns) with a preferred thickness between 1000 Angstroms to 2 microns. In addition, a PSG layer <b>124</b> may be implemented to prevent mobile ions from damaging material near the surface and to reduce UV surface reflection. The PSG layer may have a thickness of approximately 300 Angstroms to 1 micron. Other materials and thickness ranges may be implemented.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the substrate <b>110</b> may include a sapphire, bulk GaN, bulk AlN or bulk AlGaN substrate. The first epitaxial layer <b>111</b>, the second epitaxial layer <b>112</b> and the third epitaxial layer <b>114</b> may include GaN, AlN, AlGaN or AlInGaN to form a p-n junction where the avalanching will occur. The APD device may also include AlGaN epitaxial layers of various Al and Ga concentrations in order to control wavelength (or energies) of light. It may also include the use of AlInGaN layers of varying Al, In and Ga concentrations. First epitaxial layer <b>111</b> may have a thickness of approximately 2 microns, second epitaxial layer <b>112</b> may have a thickness of approximately 3 microns and third epitaxial layer <b>114</b> may have a thickness of approximately 0.4 microns. Other measurements may be implemented as well, as discussed above in connection with FIG. <b>1</b>. In a GaN APD, metal electrodes <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> may comprise a combination of various metals. In particular, metal electrode <b>118</b> may include Ti/Au, Ti/Al/Ti/Au or Ti/Al/Pt/Au at a cathode end. Metal electrode <b>120</b> may include Ni/Au or Ni/Pt/Au at an anode end.

<p id="P-00032" num="00032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an example of a modeled electrical field profile in an APD with a sloped sidewall formation of an APD device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows electrical fields as a function of position, highlighting a reduction of high fields at the sloped edges where charge is minimized. A lesser field strength at the edge is illustrated by <b>214</b>. Electrical field <b>210</b> in relation to a moderate electric field <b>212</b> illustrates a high field contour concentrated away from the edge. At approximately 2 MV/cm, electrical field <b>210</b> is adequately high to allow avalanching while maintaining a satisfactory distance away from the surfaces of the SiC (e.g., &#x3e;1 micron), where the semiconductor may otherwise be subject to high surface leakage. Therefore, the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer is important for passivating unsatisfied electric bonds at a surface near sloped sidewalls of a mesa structure. Further, the sloped mesa sidewalls of the APD device minimizes the amount of electrical charge present near the edges of the mesa, thereby lowering the electrical field in that immediate area.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">The SiC and GaN materials may be processed using a dry ion based etching technique, resulting in a sloped mesa sidewall. For example, a photoresist, ion etch process and/or a Fluorine-based chemistry may be used to form sloped sidewall mesas of the APD device. The sloped mesa shape allows a high electrical field of the APD device to be confined to a center of the device, thereby making an avalanche mechanism scalable with area. In other words, the use of a sloped mesa sidewall for electrical field confinement enables the device to be scaled to different sizes for more or less active area. This is particularly advantageous for concentrating the highest electrical field to be within the device, and not at the edges of the device.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">A specific SiC substrate and epitaxial structure may provide breakdown at approximately 400 to 500 V. In particular, the exemplary structure and doping shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may yield an electrical field profile throughout the semiconductor as shown by <b>320</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which illustrates an embodiment having a breakdown at approximately 400V. For example, the peak electrical field that may be utilized for breakdown (as well as avalanching) may occur near approximately 1.0E6 V/cm. Here, as the depletion region (e.g., an area where the high field exists) extends for approximately 5 microns, a bias for reaching that peak electric field may be approximately 400 V.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an example of a cross section of the modeled electrical field profile in an avalanche photodiode device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Electric field strength plots for cutlines vertically through a center of a model are shown by <b>310</b>, along a beveled edge inside the device are shown by <b>320</b> and along a beveled edge in an oxide region covering the edge are shown by <b>330</b>. The highest electric field is along the vertical cutline <b>310</b> which peaks at about 3.0E6V/cm. Both the SiC field <b>320</b> and the oxide region field <b>330</b> covering the bevel peak at approximately 1.0E6 V/cm. Keeping the peak field in the oxide region less than approximately 2 to 3E6 V/cm may be considered useful for oxide reliability concerns. The field plots have a longer extent along these cuts as the path length along the bevel is longer than a vertical cutline.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an example of optical data from measured transmission of a PSG film and calculated transmission 4H SiC in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. <b>410</b> illustrates a measured transmission of PSG in air. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the measured transmission of PSG in air is higher than a calculated value that would be expected from SiC, as shown by <b>420</b>. <b>420</b> may be determined from an index of refraction for 4H SiC. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that a PSG coated surface provides a higher level of light absorption in addition to blocking mobile ions.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The APD device of an embodiment of the present invention avalanches uniformly over a collecting area of the device, rather than at the device edges. A positive beveled junction of the present invention stretches the electric field out at the bevel edges but not along a uniform planar portion of a p-n junction. As a result, the highest electric field and therefore the avalanche operation occurs in an active area of the device and not along its periphery. As a result, power dissipated during the avalanche operation is spread across a widest possible area thereby avoiding hot spot formation and associated reliability problems. The third epitaxial layer <b>114</b> may serve to prevent higher electric fields from reaching a surface through internal manipulation of a depletion region. This device implements a p-n junction at high applied voltages to initialize an electrical avalanche (e.g., breakdown), near an intended operation point of the device. The electrical field in this type of device may be in the order of a few MeV/cm, supported by a depletion region internal to the device and produced by a large external bias. This device takes advantage of the robust chemical nature of SiC and GaN materials and its epitaxial layers, to operate at high temperatures (e.g., 150&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C.) and/or high vibrations (e.g., 250 G).</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">According to another embodiment of the present invention, in a separate absorption and multiplication region (SAMR) device, an additional layer may be incorporated between first epitaxial layer <b>111</b> and second epitaxial layer <b>112</b> wherein the additional layer may have a thickness of approximately 1.0 microns and an N-dopant concentration of approximately 1e17 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. This embodiment of the present invention may serve to keep a multiplication region centered around the p-n junction (e.g., where the electric field is highest) apart from an absorption region (e.g., second epitaxial layer <b>112</b>). This may help to reduce noise observed in the device by minimizing a random absorption phenomena in the multiplication region.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">The avalanche aspect of an embodiment of the present invention poses an additional constraint, specifically on the angle of the mesa sidewall. As large electrical fields are required in SiC and GaN breakdown and therefore avalanche (e.g., typically in the order to 1-3 MV/cm), it is desirable to confine the electrical field away from the edges of the APD device to minimize current leakage occurring at a surface. A sloped mesa may include sidewalls intersecting a substrate by an angle between approximately 20 to 45 degrees. There are currently wet and dry etch techniques for SiC, however, dry etch techniques are more repeatable and controllable in comparison to wet techniques in general. According to an embodiment of the present invention, a dry etch technique may be implemented.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">In dry etching techniques, Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) may be implemented to realize a mesa structure. The effects of the etch may be improved by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP), which adds a coil to a standard RIE chamber for additional plasma enhancement. Principally, this involves the generation of additional ions near the material surface, which creates an ion rich plasma and one that is spatially more uniform than RIE plasmas. Results may include improvements in etching control (e.g., physical and chemical) and enhanced uniformity.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">Without special treatments to the mask material, the resulting mesa profile may be approximately 0 to 10 degrees variant from the substrate normal, depending on the photoresist (PR) selected and the conditions under which it is treated prior to etching.</p>
<p id="P-00042" num="00042">There are at least two methods for creating a mesa with a desired angle. The methods may include reflow of the PR and gray scale masking. PR reflow may be performed by hard baking the photoresist following the exposure, allowing solvents to bake out of the PR and letting the surface become &#x201c;molten,&#x201d; thereby changing the shape of the PR. For example, a photoresist may be used to achieve a target etch depth of approximately 4 microns is desired. The photoresist may afford a coating of thicknesses greater than approximately 10 microns, thereby allowing the target etch depth to be reached with a SiC/PR selectivity as low as 0.5 microns, for example. An example of this technique and resulting ICP etch is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, where 4H SiC has been profiled with a 4 micron mesa.</p>
<p id="P-00043" num="00043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an example of a scanning electron micrograph of a sloped mesa profile in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a scanning electron micrograph of a corner of a SiC avalanche photodiode. This demonstrates the ability to realize sloped mesa sidewalls using a reflow of photoresist method.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">Gray scaling takes advantage of a photoresist mask which has been developed in a way to realize several levels of exposure, as determined by transparency or gray scale. Following the exposure through the mask, the photoresist may be developed away, according to a dose of light received through the mask in each area, which may be determined by the transparency of the mask. Thus, the resist may be profiled without heating the resist to a molten state where a desired PR profile may be controllably realized.

<p id="P-00045" num="00045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of fabricating APDs in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At step <b>610</b>, a substrate is prepared which may include preparing a bulk substrate, for example, and a plurality of epitaxial materials. At step <b>612</b>, a wafer structure may be cleaned where the wafer structure encompasses the substrate and epitaxial materials of step <b>610</b>. At step <b>614</b>, mesa patterning may be performed. Mesa patterning may be formed by a photoresist reflow at step <b>616</b> or gray scale masking at step <b>618</b>. At step <b>620</b>, ICP etching may be performed to form a mesa structure. At step <b>622</b>, patterning may be performed. In particular, patterning may refer to a photolithography process in which the photoresist is spun onto the wafer at a controlled speed, aligned with a mask, exposed to high energy light, and developed. The resulting photoresist features may include straight sidewalls with photoresist features near vertical. At step <b>624</b>, ICP etching may be performed to thin the mesa to a desired thickness. At step <b>626</b>, a layer of SiO<sub>2 </sub>may be deposited on a surface of the mesa. At step <b>628</b>, the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer may be patterned and etched to a desired shape and/or thickness. At step <b>630</b>, a cathode and an anode may be formed. The cathode and anode formation may further involve additional steps of patterning, depositing, liftoff, annealing and/or other additional steps. At step <b>632</b>, a layer of PSG may be deposited on the surface of the mesa. At step <b>634</b>, at least one contact (e.g., a gold contact) may be deposited on the structure.</p>

<p id="P-00001" num="00001">Even if there may exist a difference in reading density between reading positions, there will be provided an image reader capable of accurately detecting and removing streaks-shaped noise caused by the adhesion of dust particles to the reading unit. A CCD reads an original at each reading position, and image data A and B in each reading position are obtained from an output delay circuit and a shading correction circuit. A streak detection circuit judges a difference A&#x2212;B between each image data through the use of a threshold corrected on the basis of an average density difference between each image data A and B, and outputs black streak detection data in accordance with the judgment result. A streak removal circuit always outputs the image data A, but if black streak detection data is outputted, image data B corrected on the basis of the average density difference is outputted in place of the image data A.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e357" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00002" num="00002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="P-00003" num="00003">The present invention relates to an image reader such as a digital copying machine, a facsimile and a scanner and its image reading method.</p>
<p id="P-00004" num="00004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="P-00005" num="00005">There have been provided various types of image readers such as a digital copying machine, a facsimile and a scanner which read an original to be conveyed by a conveying device in a predetermined reading position. In these types of image readers, dust particles or the like may adhere to a reading unit. In such cases, when an image is read, the dust particles are read by the reading unit, and therefore, streaks, which are not in the original image but extend in the slow-scanning direction, appear on an output image or a transmitted image (hereinafter, simply referred to as &#x201c;output image&#x201d;) to be obtained from the image reader.</p>
<p id="P-00006" num="00006">As a way of solving this problem, there have been proposed a method of giving processing for preventing dust particles or the like from adhering to the surface of contact glass on the reading unit, a method of setting the position of the reading unit to a place where dust particles hardly adhere and the like. These methods, however, cannot overcome a drawback which occurs when dust particles have adhered to the reading unit, that is, a drawback in which streaks due to adhesion of dust particles appear on the output image.</p>
<p id="P-00007" num="00007">A technique which prevents, when dust particles adhere to the reading unit, the dust particles from affecting an output image has been proposed in, for example, Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 9-139844.</p>
<p id="P-00008" num="00008">The outline of an image reader disclosed in the Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 9-139844 is as follows: First, in the present image reader, an original under conveyance is read in two reading positions slightly apart from each other along a conveying direction of the original. In this in respect, for the sake of convenience in the following description, the first reading position, which the original under conveyance passes through, is called an &#x201c;upstream-side reading position&#x201d; and the second reading position, which it passes through, is called a &#x201c;downstream-side reading positions&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="P-00009" num="00009">When an image is in this manner read from the original in the two places: upstream-side reading position and downstream-side reading position, in the upstream-side reading position, image data on each fast-scanning line which has been arranged in a slow-scanning direction as shown in, for example, the following:
<ul id="ul100001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul100002-li00002">
    <ul id="ul100002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul100002-p00010" num="00010">Pk, Pk+1, Pk+2, Pk+3 . . .
<br/>
are sequentially obtained.
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="P-00012" num="00012">In contrast, in the downstream-side reading position, image data, which is, for example, d lines behind in phase than this image data, is obtained as follows:
<ul id="ul100003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul100004-li00004">
    <ul id="ul100004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul100002-p00013" num="00013">Pk+d, Pk+d+1, Pk+d+2, Pk+d+3 . . . In this respect, a suffix in the image data Pk or the like in this example is the number of the fast-scanning line.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="P-00014" num="00014">If the assumption is made that dust particles adhered only to a position corresponding to the downstream-side reading position on the contact glass, image data faithful to the original image could be obtained from the upstream-side reading position, while image data affected by dust particles would be obtained from the downstream-side reading position and a difference would occur between both image data.</p>
<p id="P-00015" num="00015">Thus, in the present image reader, with respect to the image data in the upstream-side reading position, image data having the same phase as the image data in the downstream-side reading position is generated by imparting a delay corresponding to the above-described phase delay d, and this image data is compared with the image data in the downstream-side reading position. If there is a difference between the two, it will be determined that dust particles have adhered to the downstream-side reading position.</p>
<p id="P-00016" num="00016">Also, in this case, it can be said that, of the image data in the downstream-side reading position, a portion different from the image data in the upstream-side reading position is image data in a portion affected by dust particles. Thus, in the present image reader, by replacing the image data in the portion affected by the dust particles with fixed mask data, streaks to be appeared on the output image are removed.</p>
<p id="P-00017" num="00017">In the configuration disclosed in the above-described Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 9-139844, image data pieces in the downstream-side reading position and the upstream-side reading position are binarized respectively, and whether or not dust particles have adhered is determined depending on whether or not these binarization data pieces are different. For this reason, only when either of each image data piece in the downstream-side reading position or the upstream-side reading position is higher than a binarization threshold and the other is lower than the threshold, it is determined that the dust particles have adhered. When both image data pieces exceed the threshold or when they do not exceed the threshold, there is the problem that it is not determined that the dust particles have adhered even if the dust particles have adhered.</p>
<p id="P-00018" num="00018">As a method which solves this problem and precisely determines the adhesion of dust particles, there can be conceived a method which compares each image data (multilevel data) in the downstream-side reading position and the upstream-side reading position as it is, and determines that dust particles have adhered if a difference between the two exceeds a predetermined threshold. However, there may take place a steady offset between each image data piece in the downstream-side reading position and the upstream-side reading position resulting from the configuration or the like of the image reader. In a situation in which such a steady offset takes place, there is the problem that even if the adhesion of dust particles is determined on the basis of a difference between each image data piece in each reading position, the determination may become incorrect. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a detailed description of this problem will be made.</p>
<p id="P-00019" num="00019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view showing the configuration of an original conveying system in the image reader and an optical system for reading an image. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an original <b>2</b> is carried to a conveying roller <b>4</b> one sheet at a time by a drawing-in roller <b>3</b>. The conveying roller <b>4</b> conveys the original <b>2</b> to a contact glass <b>5</b> by changing the original conveying direction. The original <b>2</b> is pressed against the contact glass <b>5</b> by a back platen <b>7</b>, and is finally exhausted from the conveying device by an exhaust roller B. The above-described upstream-side reading position and downstream-side reading position are located above the contact glass <b>5</b>. A reference numeral A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> designates an original image in the upstream-side reading position, and a reference numeral B, an original image in the downstream-side reading position. These original images A and B have their optical paths changed by a first mirror <b>9</b>, a second mirror <b>10</b> and a third mirror <b>11</b> respectively, are reduced by a lens <b>12</b>, and reach CCD <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00020" num="00020">In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the original <b>2</b> is conveyed obliquely downward to the contact glass <b>5</b> by the conveying roller <b>4</b>. At the time of the original reading, an optical path of an original image A in the upstream-side reading position and an optical path of an original image B in the downstream-side reading position are perpendicular to the contact glass <b>5</b>, but the upstream-side reading position and the downstream-side reading position are provided within a section in which the original <b>2</b> is conveyed obliquely with respect to the contact glass <b>5</b>. Therefore, an optical path length between the upstream-side reading position and CCD <b>1</b> becomes longer than that between the downstream-side reading position and CCD <b>1</b>. For this reason, even if no dust particles adhere to the contact glass <b>5</b>, a density value of a read image A in the upstream-side reading position becomes higher than a density value of a read image B in the downstream-side reading position as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, and an offset &#x394;D having a predetermined size takes place between image data corresponding to each reading position.</p>
<p id="P-00021" num="00021">When a difference obtained by deducting the density value of the read image A in the upstream-side reading position from the density value of the read image B in the downstream-side reading position is compared with the threshold to determine adhesion of dust particles, it becomes difficult to determine the adhesion of dust particles because if dust particles adhere to the contact glass in the downstream-side reading position, a difference between density values of each read image is reduced under the influence of the offset &#x394;D. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> shows its example. If the assumption is made that there is no offset &#x394;D described above between each reading position, there would take place a comparatively large difference &#x394;D<b>1</b> between density values of read images in each reading position if dust particles adhere to the contact glass in the downstream-side reading position. In a configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, however, since there takes place the offset &#x394;D between each reading position, the difference between density values of read images in each reading position decreases to &#x394;D<b>2</b> from &#x394;D<b>1</b>, and it becomes difficult to determine the adhesion of dust particles.</p>
<p id="P-00022" num="00022">In the configuration disclosed in the Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 9-139844, by replacing image data affected by dust particles with fixed mask data, the streaks on an output image have been removed, but this method has a problem that the output image is deteriorated because a density difference takes place between an image corresponded to the mask data and images all around the image.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="00023">As a remedy, there can be conceived a method in which, in a case where dust particles have been found to adhere, image data of the read image, in which, of the read images A and B, it has been found that no dust particles adhere, is selected to thereby obtain image data from which the dust particles have been removed. When, however, this method is executed under such circumstance that the offset &#x394;D takes place, the image data affected by dust particles is to be replaced with image data having different density therefrom, and the output image will be deteriorated. For example, it is assumed in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that when it is found that no dust particles have adhered, image data of the read image B in the downstream-side reading position is selected, while when it is found that dust particles have adhered to the downstream-side reading position, image data of the read image A in the upstream-side reading position is selected. In this case, since the image data of the read image A has been selected in place of the image data of the read image B, it is possible to erase clear streaks caused by the dust particles, but thinly black streaks remain in a portion in which the image data has been replaced because a density value for the read image A is higher than that for the read image B.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e677" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and provides an image reader and an image reading method capable of accurately detecting, even if there may exist a density difference in each read image corresponding to the same image in plural reading positions, streaks-shaped noise caused by adhesion of dust particles to a reading unit, or the like to remove it from the output image.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="00025">According to an aspect of the present invention, an image reader, having a conveying part that conveys an original, and first and second reading parts that read the original conveyed by the conveying part, in which if the same image has been read by the first and second reading parts, a density value of a read image obtained from the first reading part is higher than a density value of a read image to be obtained from the second reading part, includes a noise detection part that judges, if a difference between density values of the same area on the original read by the first and second reading parts, respectively, exceeds a predetermined threshold, that a streaks-shaped noise is contained in the read image obtained by the first reading part, and a noise removal part that generates, if the noise detection part judges that the streaks-shaped noise is not contained in the read image obtained by the first reading part, an output image using the read image obtained by the first reading part, and that generates, if the noise detection part judges that that the streaks-shaped noise is contained in the read image obtained by the first reading part, the output image using the read image obtained by the second reading part.</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">According to this configuration, the presence or absence of the streaks-shaped noise can be found by judging a difference obtained by deducting the read image in the second reading position from the read image in the first reading position, in which the reading density value is originally high, and therefore, it is possible to reliably detect streaks-shaped noise caused by adhesion of dust particles, and to replace it with a read image containing no noise in the second reading position. Also, the read image in the second reading position has a lower density value than the read image in the first reading position containing no noise caused by adhesion of dust particles, and therefore, a portion in which the read image has been replaced becomes thinly white noise, but such noise has an advantage that it is not conspicuous.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">According to another aspect of the present invention, the image reader includes a threshold correction part that determines an average density difference between average densities of the same area on the original read by the first and second reading parts, respectively, and that corrects a predetermined threshold on the basis of the average density difference and outputs the corrected threshold, and a noise detection part that judges, if a difference between density values of the same area on the original read by the first and second reading parts, respectively, exceeds the threshold outputted from the threshold correction part, that a streaks-shaped noise is contained in the read image obtained by the first reading part.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">According to this configuration, when judging the presence or absence of any noise on the basis of a difference obtained by deducting the read image in the second reading position from the read image in the first reading position, there is used a threshold corrected by an average density difference between read images in each reading position, and therefore, it is possible to accurately judge the presence or absence of the noise.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">In this aspect of the present invention, the image reader may further includes a correction part that corrects the read image obtained by the second reading part on the basis of the average density difference determined by the threshold correction part, and a noise removal part that generates, if the noise detection part judges that the streaks-shaped noise is not contained in the read image obtained by the first reading part, an output image using the read image obtained by the first reading part, and that generates, if the noise detection part judges that that the streaks-shaped noise is contained in the read image obtained by the first reading part, the output image using the read image obtained by the second reading part, which has been subjected to the correction by the correction part.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="00030">According to this configuration, since the read image containing noise obtained in the first reading position is replaced with an image obtained by correcting the read image obtained in the second reading position on the basis of the average density difference, it is possible to eliminate any density difference between the replacement point and its surrounding portions.</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the image reader, having a conveying part that conveys an original, and first and second reading parts that read the original to be conveyed by the conveying part, in which if the same image has been read by the first and second reading parts, a density value of a read image to be obtained from the first reading part is higher than a density value of a read image to be obtained from the second reading part, includes a correction part that corrects the read image of either the first or second reading part to reduce an average density difference between average densities of the same area on the original read by the first and second reading parts, respectively, and a noise detection part that judges, after the read image obtained by either the first or second reading part has been corrected by the correction part, if a difference between density values of the same area on the original read by the first and second reading parts, respectively, exceeds a predetermined threshold, that a streaks-shaped noise is contained in the read image obtained by either the first or second reading part that has a higher density value.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">According to this configuration, read images in each reading position are corrected so as to eliminate the average density difference, the presence or absence of streaks-shaped noise is judged on the basis of a difference between density values for each read image after this correction, and therefore, streaks-shaped noise caused by adhesion of dust particles can be reliably detected.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">In this aspect of the present invention, the image reader may further includes a noise removal part that generates, if the noise detection part judges that the streaks-shaped noise is not contained in the read image obtained by the first or second reading part having the higher density value, an output image using the read image obtained by the reading part having the higher density value, which has been subjected to the correction by the correction part, and that generates, if the noise detection part judges that the streaks-shaped noise is contained in the read image obtained by the reading part having the higher density value, the output image using the read image obtained by the other reading part having lower density value, which has been subjected to the correction by the correction part.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">According to this configuration, when noise is detected, any replacement point can be made inconspicuous because the noise is removed by replacement with each read image after correction having no average density difference.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">According to still another aspect of the present invention, an image reading method that reads an image by a first reading part from an area on an original conveyed by a conveying part, and then reads the image by a second reading part from the same area on the original to generate an output image, in which a density value of a read image obtained by the second reading part is lower than a density value of a read image obtained by the first reading part, includes the steps of judging whether a difference between the density values of the read images obtained by the first and second reading parts, respectively, exceeds a predetermined threshold, and generating, if it is judged that the difference does not exceed the predetermined threshold, the output image using the read image obtained by the first reading part, and generating, if it is judged that the difference exceeds the predetermined threshold, the output image using the read image obtained by the second reading part.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">According to still another aspect of the present invention, an image reading method that reads an image by a first reading part from an area on an original conveyed by a conveying part, and then reads the image by a second reading part from the same area on the original to generate an output image, in which a density value of a read image obtained by the second reading part is lower than a density value of a read image obtained by the first reading part, includes the steps of determining an average density difference between average densities of the same area on the original read by the first and second reading parts, respectively, correcting a predetermined threshold and the read image obtained by the second reading part on the basis of the average density difference, judging whether a difference between the density values of the read images obtained by the first and second reading parts, respectively, exceeds the corrected threshold, and generating, if it is judged that the difference does not exceed the corrected threshold, the output image using the read image obtained by the first reading part, and generating, if it is judged that the difference exceeds the corrected threshold, the output image using the read image obtained by the second reading part.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">According to still another aspect of the present invention, an image reading method that reads an image by a first reading part from an area on an original conveyed by a conveying part, and then reads the image by a second reading part from the same area on the original to generate an output image, in which a density value of a read image obtained by the second reading part is lower than a density value of a read image obtained by the first reading part, includes the steps of correcting at least one of the read images obtained by the first and second reading parts, respectively, to reduce an average density difference between average densities of the same area on the original read by the first and second reading parts, respectively, judging whether a difference between the density values of the read images, at least one of which has been corrected, obtained by the first and second reading parts, respectively, exceeds a predetermined threshold, and generating, if it is judged that the difference does not exceed the predetermined threshold, the output image using the read image obtained by the first reading part, and generating, if it is judged that the difference exceeds the predetermined threshold, the output image using the read image obtained by the second reading part.</p>

<heading id="heading-d0e882" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">Hereinafter, with reference to the drawings, the description will be made on embodiments according to the present invention.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e892" level="1">A. First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of an image reader according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a reference numeral CCD <b>1</b> designates a part for reading an original to be conveyed by an original conveying system shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. In the present embodiment, this CCD <b>1</b> is driven through a driving signal from a CCD driving circuit <b>13</b>, whereby an original image is read in each of an upstream-side reading position and a downstream-side reading position on a conveying path of the original to output an analog image signal A in the upstream-side reading position and an analog image signal B in the downstream-side reading position.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">The configuration of the original conveying system and the configuration of the optical system between each reading position and CCD <b>1</b> on the original conveying path are as already described referring to FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">On a package for the CCD <b>1</b>, two rows of line sensors, in each of which N pieces of 7 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;7 &#x3bc;m photo-diodes are arranged, are formed as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>. Each of these line sensors is a part for reading an original image in each reading position on the upstream side and on the downstream side respectively. Each line sensor is spaced apart by 70 &#x3bc;m from each other. In contrast, the upstream-side reading position and the downstream-side reading position on the original conveying path are spaced apart by 423 &#x3bc;m. Each original image (linear image for one line each) in each of these reading positions is reduced by passing it through the optical system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to form an image on each line sensor.</p>
<p id="P-00055" num="00055">In the line sensor corresponding to the upstream-side reading position, current, which flows through n-pieces of phototransistors constituting the line sensor, is sequentially detected for each line period (fast-scanning period), and is outputted as an analog image signal A representing the density of each pixel of one line (n pixels). Similarly, even in the line sensor corresponding to the downstream-side reading position, current for flowing through n-pieces of phototransistors is sequentially detected for each line period (fast-scanning period) to output an analog image signal B representing the density of each pixel of one line (n pixels) An interval 70 &#x3bc;m between each line sensor corresponding to each reading position on the upstream side and on the downstream side is an interval corresponding to scanning lines for 10 lines. Therefore, if there are no fluctuations in the original conveying velocity, the analog image signal B becomes an image signal which lags the analog image signal A by a phase lag corresponding to 10 lines.</p>
<p id="P-00056" num="00056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the latter part of the CCD <b>1</b>, there are provided a signal processing system including a sample holding circuit <b>14</b>A, an output amplifier circuit <b>15</b>A, an AD conversion circuit <b>16</b>A and a shading correction circuit <b>17</b>A, and a signal processing system including a sample holding circuit <b>14</b>B, an output amplifier circuit <b>15</b>B, an AD conversion circuit <b>16</b>B and a shading correction circuit <b>17</b>B. The former is a signal processing system corresponding to an image signal A in the upstream-side reading position, and the latter is a signal processing system corresponding to an image signal B in the downstream-side reading position.</p>
<p id="P-00057" num="00057">Analog image signals A and B to be obtained from the CCD <b>1</b> are sampled by the sample holding circuits <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B respectively, thereafter are amplified to an appropriate level respectively by the output amplifier circuits <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B, and are converted into digital image data A and B respectively by the AD conversion circuits <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B. These digital image data pieces A and B are subjected to corrections corresponding to sensitivity variations of CCD <b>1</b> and distribution characteristic of quantity of light of the optical system by the shading correction circuits <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B. An outline of each signal processing system corresponding to the image signals A and B has just been described above.</p>
<p id="P-00058" num="00058">An output delay circuit <b>18</b> delays image data A to be outputted from the shading correction circuit <b>17</b>A by delay time corresponding to 10 lines to output as image data having the same phase as the image data B. A streak detection circuit <b>19</b> is a part, which detects black streak-shaped noise contained in the image data A by comparing the image data A to be outputted from the output delay circuit <b>18</b> with the image data B to be outputted from the shading correction circuit <b>17</b>B to output black streak detection data. Also, a streak removal circuit <b>20</b> is a part, which generates image data obtained by removing any black streak-shaped noise from the image data A on the basis of the black streak detection data from the streak detection circuit <b>19</b> to output it to an image processing circuit <b>21</b>. In this respect, the detail of the streak detection circuit <b>19</b> and the streak removal circuit <b>20</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="P-00059" num="00059">The image processing circuit <b>21</b> is a part whereby image data to be outputted from the streak removal circuit <b>20</b> is subjected to image processing such as scaling, texture removal and binarization which is required in an apparatus (such as a digital copying machine and a scanner) mounted with this image reader.</p>
<p id="P-00060" num="00060">A CPU <b>22</b> is a part which controls each portion of this image reader. Concretely, the CPU <b>22</b> sets a period for driving of the CCD <b>1</b> to be performed by a CCD driving circuit <b>13</b>, controls gains of the output amplifier circuits <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B, and controls the shading correction circuits <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B, a constant of the streak detection circuit <b>19</b> (to be described later) and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00061" num="00061">The entire configuration of the image reader according to the present embodiment has just been described above.</p>
<p id="P-00062" num="00062">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a description will be made on the streak detection circuit <b>19</b>. The streak detection circuit <b>19</b> according to the present embodiment has a data comparison circuit <b>23</b>, a continuity detection block <b>24</b> and a threshold correction circuit <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00063" num="00063">To the data comparison block <b>23</b>, image data pieces A and B representing density of pixel for n pieces of pixels are respectively inputted for each line period (fast-scanning period). The image data A corresponds to the original image, which has been read in the upstream-side reading position, but is subjected to a delay corresponding to 10 lines by the output delay circuit <b>18</b>. Therefore, if there is no fluctuation in the original conveying velocity, the image data pieces A and B to be inputted to the data comparison block <b>23</b> represent read images corresponding to the same line on the original respectively, and both are those which should originally coincide with each other. When dust particles and the like adhere to the upstream-side reading position, however, of image data A corresponding to the upstream-side reading position, image data of the pixel corresponding to areas of dust particles adhered is affected by them, and density of the pixel to be represented by the image data A seems to become noticeably higher than density of the pixel to be represented by the image data B. In this data comparison block <b>23</b>, if the image data A is noticeably higher than the image data B, a signal to the effect that the image data A may be affected by the dust particles is generated on the basis of such a precondition. It will be further detailed below.</p>
<p id="P-00064" num="00064">A comparison circuit <b>25</b> in this data comparison block <b>23</b> compares the image data A with the image data B, and if the former is larger than the latter, outputs a signal &#x201c;1&#x201d;, and otherwise, outputs a signal &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Also, a subtraction circuit <b>26</b> subtracts the image data B from the image data A to output a difference A&#x2212;B between image data A and B. A comparison circuit <b>27</b> compares the difference A&#x2212;B determined by the subtraction circuit <b>26</b> with a threshold obtained by computing by a threshold computing circuit <b>34</b>, and outputs a signal &#x201c;1&#x201d; if the difference A&#x2212;B is higher than the threshold, and otherwise, outputs a signal &#x201c;0&#x201d;. In this respect, the detail of the threshold computing circuit <b>34</b> will be described later. An AND circuit <b>28</b> receives an output signal from the comparison circuit <b>25</b> and an output signal from the comparison circuit <b>27</b> to output a logical product of the two. That is, if the density of a pixel corresponding to the image data A is higher than the density of a pixel corresponding to the image data B and there is a density difference higher than a predetermined threshold between the both pixels, the AND circuit <b>28</b> outputs a signal &#x201c;1&#x201d;. And otherwise, it outputs a signal &#x201c;0&#x201d;. In this respect, the output signal from this AND circuit <b>28</b> will be called &#x201c;dust particles judgment bit&#x201d; for the sake of convenience in the following description.</p>
<p id="P-00065" num="00065">As already described, to the data comparison block <b>23</b>, image data pieces A and B of one line (n pixels) are respectively inputted for each line period. In the data comparison block <b>23</b>, the above-described process is performed for each pixel constituting one line, and n bits of serial data including a dust particles judgment bit representing, for each pixel, whether or not the image data A is affected by dust particles, are outputted from the AND circuit <b>28</b> for each line period.</p>
<p id="P-00066" num="00066">The continuity detection block <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is provided in the latter part of the data comparison block <b>27</b>. This continuity detection block <b>24</b> includes four line memories <b>29</b> to <b>32</b> and an AND circuit <b>33</b>. The line memories <b>29</b> to <b>32</b> are constructed of a FIFO (First-In First-Out) memory respectively. Each of these line memories is cascade-connected as shown, and constitute one shift register which sequentially shifts a dust particles judgment bit to be outputted from the data comparison block <b>23</b>. Also, each line memory is constructed so as to be able to store n bits of serial data, and data inputted into each line memory is outputted from the line memory concerned after one line period.</p>
<p id="P-00067" num="00067">Therefore, when a dust particle judgment bit corresponding to a pixel is outputted from the AND circuit <b>28</b> of the data comparison block <b>23</b>, each dust particle judgment bit corresponding to each pixel 1 to 4 lines ahead of the pixel concerned respectively will be outputted from the line memories <b>29</b> to <b>32</b>. If all dust particles judgment bits to be outputted from the AND circuit <b>28</b> of the data comparison block <b>23</b> and the line memories <b>29</b> to <b>32</b> are &#x201c;1&#x201d;, that is, if judgment to the effect that pixels having the same position in the fast-scanning direction are affected by dust particles has been given for five successive lines, the AND circuit <b>33</b> outputs a signal &#x201c;1&#x201d;, and otherwise, outputs a signal &#x201c;0&#x201d;. An output signal from the AND circuit <b>33</b> is black streak detection data.</p>
<p id="P-00068" num="00068">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a description will be made on a configuration of the threshold correction circuit <b>34</b>. The threshold correction circuit <b>34</b> according to the present embodiment is constructed of average value computing circuits <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>, a subtraction circuit <b>37</b> and an addition circuit <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00069" num="00069">In a case where an original image is read in two different reading positions by an original conveying device as already described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when each optical path length between each reading position and the CCD sensor <b>1</b> is different from each other, an offset in density takes place between read images obtained from each reading position even if the same original image is read. This offset differs depending on the configuration of the image reader and the reading position.</p>
<p id="P-00070" num="00070">The threshold correction circuit <b>34</b> is a circuit in which there is performed correction for reflecting this offset of reading density in a threshold used in the data comparison block <b>23</b>. In the average value computing circuits <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> in this threshold correction circuit <b>34</b>, there are respectively inputted image data pieces A and B corresponding to the same image obtained in the upstream-side reading position and the downstream-side reading position. The average value computing circuit <b>35</b> determines an average value for 64 pixels on the image data A. Also, the average value computing circuit <b>36</b> determines an average value for the same pixel number as the average value computing circuit <b>35</b>, that is, for image data B for 64 pixels. When the average value for the image data B determined by the average value computing circuit <b>36</b> is deducted from the average value for the image data A determined by the average value computing circuit <b>35</b>, and each density value for image data A and B obtained from the same point on the original is compared, a subtraction circuit <b>37</b> outputs average value difference data indicating how much the former is higher than the latter in average. This average value difference data corresponds to the above-described offset. A predetermined threshold level to be given from the CPU <b>22</b> is subjected to correction to add average value difference data to be obtained from this subtraction circuit <b>37</b> by the addition circuit <b>38</b>. The threshold level after the correction to be obtained from the addition circuit <b>38</b> is supplied to the comparison circuit <b>27</b> in the data comparison block <b>23</b>. Also, the average value difference data is thus used to correct the threshold, and in addition, is also sent to the streak removal circuit <b>20</b> to be used for processing for removing streaks.</p>
<p id="P-00071" num="00071">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a description will be made on a configuration of the streak removal circuit <b>20</b>. The streak removal circuit <b>20</b> is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, constructed of an addition circuit <b>39</b>, a selection circuit <b>40</b>, delay circuits <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, and a selection circuit <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00072" num="00072">The addition circuit <b>39</b> adds the image data B to the average value difference data obtained by computing in the threshold correction circuit <b>34</b> for outputting. The selection circuit <b>40</b> selects the image data A if black streak detection data to be outputted from the streak detection circuit <b>19</b> is &#x201c;0&#x201d;, and selects the image data from the addition circuit <b>39</b> if it is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, and outputs the data selected in this manner as the black streak removal image data. The delay circuit <b>41</b> delays the image data from the addition circuit <b>39</b> by a 4-line period for outputting. Also, the delay circuit <b>42</b> delays the black streak removal image data from the selection circuit <b>40</b> by a 4-line period for outputting. The selection circuit <b>43</b> selects the black streak removal image data from the delay circuit <b>42</b> if the black streak detection data to be outputted from the streak detection circuit <b>19</b> is &#x201c;0&#x201d;, and selects the image data B subjected to density correction from the delay circuit <b>41</b> if it is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, and outputs the data selected in this manner as the final black streak removal image data.</p>
<p id="P-00073" num="00073">In short, the streak removal circuit <b>20</b> described above outputs the image data A as it is if the black streak detection data is &#x201c;0&#x201d;. If, however, the black streak detection data becomes &#x201c;1&#x201d; and it has been found that black streaks would appear on the output image when the image data A is used, going back 4 lines, the average value difference data will be added in place of the image data A, to thereby output the image data B (that is, black streak removal image data) subjected to density correction. Going back to before the 4-line period in this manner, the image data is switched. This is because the switching of the black streak detection data from &#x201c;0&#x201d; to &#x201c;1&#x201d; is delayed by the 4-line period as compared with timing at which black streaks appear on the output image. The delay circuits <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> and the selection circuit <b>43</b> are added in the latter part of the selection circuit <b>40</b> in order to go back a 4-line period for switching the image data.</p>
<p id="P-00074" num="00074">The detail of the configuration of the image reader according to the present embodiment has just been described above.</p>
<p id="P-00075" num="00075">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a description will be made on an operation of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="P-00076" num="00076">In the present embodiment, depending upon whether or not the image data A (corresponding to the upstream-side reading position) from the output delay circuit <b>18</b> is larger than the image data B (corresponding to the downstream-side reading position) from the shading correction circuit <b>17</b>B and a value obtained by deducting the image data B from the image data A exceeds a threshold from the threshold correction circuit <b>34</b>, it is judged in the streak detection circuit <b>19</b> whether or not there are streaks caused by dust particles on the image data A, and black streak detection data indicating the result is outputted.</p>
<p id="P-00077" num="00077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the optical path length between the upstream-side reading position and the CCD <b>1</b> is longer than the optical path length between the downstream-side reading position and the CCD <b>1</b>. For this reason, even when no dust particles have adhered to the contact glass <b>5</b>, the image data A is larger than the image data B as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, and an offset &#x394;D having a predetermined size takes place between the both image data pieces.</p>
<p id="P-00078" num="00078">In such a situation, when dust particles adhere to the upstream-side reading position, the image data A, which is originally larger than the image data B, becomes even larger under the influence of dust particles adhered, the image data A exceeds the image data B by a large amount, and a large difference &#x394;D<b>1</b> takes place between the two as exemplified in FIG. <b>7</b>B. For this reason, an output signal from the comparison circuit <b>25</b> in the streak detection circuit <b>19</b> reliably becomes &#x201c;1&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="P-00079" num="00079">On the other hand, in the threshold correction circuit <b>34</b> within the streak detection circuit <b>19</b>, an average value for 64 pixels of the image data B is deducted from an average value for 64 pixels of the image data A to obtain average value difference data corresponding to the offset &#x394;D. A threshold TH from the CPU <b>22</b> is subjected to correction to add this average value difference data, and the threshold after this correction TH+&#x394;D is supplied to the comparison circuit <b>27</b>. In the comparison circuit <b>27</b>, a difference between the image data A and the image data B is compared with the post-correction threshold TH+&#x394;D (See FIG. <b>7</b>B), and when the former exceeds the latter, a signal &#x201c;1&#x201d; is outputted. When each output signal from both the comparison circuits <b>25</b> and <b>27</b> is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, the AND circuit <b>28</b> outputs a dust particle judgment bit &#x201c;1&#x201d;. Thus, when this dust particle judgment bit &#x201c;1&#x201d; is continuously outputted in the slow-scanning direction, black streak detection data &#x201c;1&#x201d; is outputted from the AND circuit <b>33</b>, and is supplied to the streak removal circuit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="P-00080" num="00080">When this black streak detection data &#x201c;1&#x201d; is outputted, the post-correction image data B obtained by adding the average value difference data to the image data B is selected by the selection circuit <b>40</b> in the streak removal circuit <b>20</b>, is outputted as black streak removal image data, and this is outputted through the selection circuit <b>43</b> as final black streak removal image data.</p>
<p id="P-00081" num="00081">The image data B, which is a basis of the final black streak removal image data, is originally the offset &#x394;D smaller than the image data A. Since, however, the image data B is subjected to correction to add the average value difference data as described above, there can be obtained the final black streak removal image data having the substantially same density as the image data A when no dust particles have adhered thereto (See FIG. <b>7</b>C).</p>
<p id="P-00082" num="00082">In the present embodiment in this manner, in a configuration in which the image data A becomes larger than the image data B if no dust particles adhere, by comparing a difference obtained by deducting the image data B from the image data A with the threshold, the presence or absence of black streaks is judged, and moreover, this comparison is made using a threshold corrected by a difference between average values for each image data piece. Therefore, it is possible to accurately judge whether or not black streaks under the influence of adhesion of dust particles are generated.</p>
<p id="P-00083" num="00083">In addition, when an output image is formed using the image data A and black streak detection data is outputted, it is always replaced with the image data B corrected in density by the average value difference data, and therefore, it is possible to prevent any drawback in which this replacement portion becomes more thinly black than the surroundings.</p>
<p id="P-00084" num="00084">In this respect, although in the present embodiment, the density of the image data B has been corrected, it is possible ah to omit this density correction, to use the image data B as it is as black streak removal data and to replace the image data A with it. In this case, since the image data B is smaller than the image data A when no dust particles adhere, noise, in which the replacement portion becomes thinly white due to this replacement, appears on the output image but such noise does not become conspicuous.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e2127" level="1">B. Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="P-00085" num="00085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram showing the configuration of an image reader according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the streak detection circuit <b>19</b> and the streak removal circuit <b>20</b> are replaced with a streak detection circuit <b>119</b> and a streak removal circuit <b>120</b> respectively, and a density correction circuit <b>118</b> is added. In other respects, the configuration of the present embodiment is quite the same as that of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="P-00086" num="00086">The density correction circuit <b>118</b> is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, constructed of average value computing circuits <b>135</b> and <b>136</b>, a subtraction circuit <b>137</b> and an addition circuit <b>138</b>. To the average value computing circuits <b>135</b> and <b>136</b>, there are inputted image data pieces A and B corresponding to the same image obtained in the upstream-side reading position and the downstream-side reading position. The average value computing circuit <b>135</b> determines an average value for 64 pixels on the image data A. Also, the average value computing circuit <b>136</b> determines the same number of pixels as the average value computing circuit <b>35</b>, that is, the average value for the image data B for 64 pixels. When the average value for the image data B determined by the average value computing circuit <b>136</b> is deducted from the average value for the image data A determined by the average value computing circuit <b>135</b> and each density value for the image data pieces A and B obtained from the same point on an original is compared, the subtraction circuit <b>137</b> outputs average value difference data representing how much the former is higher in average than the latter. This average value difference data corresponds to the above-described offset. The image data B is subjected to correction to add this average value difference data by the addition circuit <b>138</b>, which outputs the post-correction image data B.</p>
<p id="P-00087" num="00087">The configuration of the streak detection circuit <b>119</b> is as shown in FIG. <b>10</b>. This streak detection circuit <b>119</b> has, unlike the streak detection circuit <b>19</b> according to the first embodiment, no threshold correction circuit, but a threshold from the CPU <b>22</b> is given as it is to the comparison circuit <b>27</b>. Also, to the comparison circuit <b>25</b> and the subtraction circuit <b>26</b>, the image data A from the output delay circuit <b>18</b> and the post-correction image data B from the density correction circuit <b>118</b> are given. Since this is the same as the streak detection circuit according to the first embodiment in other respects, the same reference numerals as those used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are used, and a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="P-00088" num="00088">The configuration of the streak removal circuit <b>120</b> is as shown in FIG. <b>11</b>. This streak removal circuit <b>120</b> has no circuit corresponding to the addition circuit <b>39</b> according to the first embodiment, but post-correction image data B from the density correction circuit <b>118</b> is given to a selection circuit <b>40</b>. Since this is the same as the streak removal circuit according to the first embodiment in other respects, the same reference numerals as those used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are used, and a description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="P-00089" num="00089">In the first embodiment, the threshold for judging whether the difference between the image data A and the image data B is large or small has been corrected on the basis of the average value difference data. In contrast, in the present embodiment, in place of such correction of the threshold, the image data B is subjected to correction to add the average value difference data by the density correction circuit <b>118</b>. In the streak detection circuit <b>119</b>, depending upon whether or not a difference obtained by deducting the post-correction image data B from the image data A exceeds a predetermined threshold, the presence or absence of black streaks caused by adhesion of dust particles is judged. By this judgment, it is found that image data having a high density value has black streaks. If it has been found that there are black streaks and the density value of the image data A is high, the image data A is replaced with the post-correction image data B in the streak removal circuit <b>120</b>. Also, when the black streak detection data is &#x201c;0&#x201d;, the image data B may be outputted. In this case, if it is found that there are black streaks and the image data B has a high density value, the post-correction image data B is replaced with the image data A in the streak removal circuit <b>120</b>. Even in the present embodiment, the same effect as the first embodiment can be obtained.</p>
<p id="P-00090" num="00090">According to an image reader according to the present invention as described above, even if there exists a density difference between each read image corresponding to the same image in plural reading positions, there is the effect that it is possible to accurately detect streak-shaped noise caused by the adhesion of dust particles to the reading unit, or the like, and to remove it from the output image.</p>

<p id="P-00022" num="00022">The image forming element and the image forming device of the present invention will be described in detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="P-00023" num="heading-00023">{Image Forming Element}</p>
<p id="P-00024" num="00024">The image forming element of the present invention has at least a film in which rod-shaped bodies are oriented (preferably parallel to each other) and which reflect incident light as colored interference light.</p>
<p id="P-00025" num="heading-00025">&#x3c;Rod-Shaped Bodies&#x3e;</p>
<p id="P-00026" num="00026">The rod-shaped body is not particularly limited provided that it is rod-shaped, and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. The rod-shaped body may be either a rod-shaped inorganic substance or rod-shaped organic substance, but a rod-shaped organic substance is preferable.</p>
<p id="P-00027" num="00027">Examples of rod-shaped organic substances are biopolymers, polysaccharides, and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00028" num="00028">Suitable examples of biopolymers are fibrous proteins, &#x3b1;-helix polypeptides, nucleic acids (DNA, RNA), and the like. Examples of fibrous proteins are fibrous proteins having &#x3b1;-helix structures such as &#x3b1;-keratin, myosin, epidermin, fibrinogen, tropomyosin, silk fibroin, and the like. Suitable examples of polysaccharides are amylose and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00029" num="00029">Among rod-shaped organic substances, spiral organic molecules whose molecules have a spiral structure are preferable from the standpoints that the rod shape can be maintained stably and that other substances can be intercalated into the interior of the molecule in accordance with the object. Among the aforementioned substances, those with spiral organic molecules include &#x3b1;-helix polypeptides, DNA, amylose, and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00030" num="heading-00030">{&#x3b1;-Helix Polypeptides}</p>
<p id="P-00031" num="00031">&#x3b1;-helix polypeptides are one of secondary structures of polypeptides. The polypeptide rotates one time (forms one spiral) for each amino acid 3.6 residue, and a hydrogen bond, which is substantially parallel to the axis of the helix, is formed between a carbonyl group (&#x2014;CO&#x2014;) and an imide group (&#x2014;NH&#x2014;) of each fourth amino acid, and this structure is repeated in units of seven amino acids. In this way, the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide has a structure which is stable energy-wise.</p>
<p id="P-00032" num="00032">The direction of the spiral of the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited, and may be either wound right or wound left. Note that, in nature, only structures whose direction of spiral is wound right exist from the standpoint of stability.</p>
<p id="P-00033" num="00033">The amino acids which form the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide are not particularly limited provided that an &#x3b1;-helix structure can be formed, and can be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. However, amino acids which facilitate formation of the &#x3b1;-helix structure are preferable. Suitable examples of such amino acids are aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), histidine (His), asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), alanine (Ala), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), cysteine (Cys), methionine (Met), tyrosine (Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), and the like. A single one of these amino acids may be used alone, or two or more may be used in combination.</p>
<p id="P-00034" num="00034">By appropriately selecting the amino acid, the property of the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide can be changed to any of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic. In the case in which the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide is to be made to be hydrophilic, suitable examples of the amino acid are serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), and the like. In the case in which the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide is to be made to be hydrophobic, suitable examples of the amino acid are phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), isoleucine (Ile), tyrosine (Tyr), methionine (Met), leucine (Leu), valine (Val), and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00035" num="00035">In the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide, the carboxyl group, which does not form a peptide bond and which is in the amino acid which forms the &#x3b1;-helix, can be made to be hydrophobic by esterification. On the other hand, an esterified carboxyl group can be made to be hydrophilic by hydrolysis.</p>
<p id="P-00036" num="00036">The amino acid may be any of a L-amino acid, a D-amino acid, a derivative in which the side chain portion of a L-amino acid or a D-amino acid is modified, or the like.</p>
<p id="P-00037" num="00037">The number of bonds (the degree of polymerization) of the amino acid in the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. However, 10 to 5000 is preferable.</p>
<p id="P-00038" num="00038">If the number of bonds (the degree of polymerization) is less than 10, it may not be possible for the polyamino acid to form a stable &#x3b1;-helix. If the number of bonds (the degree of polymerization) exceeds 5000, vertical orientation may be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p id="P-00039" num="00039">Suitable specific examples of the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide are polyglutamic acid derivatives such as poly(&#x3b3;-methyl L-glutamate), poly(&#x3b3;ethyl L-glutamate), poly(&#x3b3;-benzyl L-glutamate), poly(n-hexyl L-glutamate), etc.; polyaspartic acid derivatives such as poly(&#x3b2;-benzyl L-aspartate) etc.; polypeptides such as poly(L-leucine), poly(L-alanine), poly(L-methionine), poly(L-phenylalanine), poly(L-lysine)-poly(&#x3b3;-methyl L-glutamate), etc.</p>
<p id="P-00040" num="00040">The &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide may be a commercially available &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide, or may be appropriately synthesized or prepared in accordance with methods disclosed in known publications, etc.</p>
<p id="P-00041" num="00041">As one example of synthesizing the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide, the synthesis of block copolypeptide [poly(L-lysine)<sub>25</sub>-poly(&#x3b3;-methyl L-glutamate)<sub>60</sub>]PLLZ<sub>25</sub>-PMLG<sub>60 </sub>is as follows. As is shown by the following formula, block copolypeptide [poly(L-lysine)<sub>25 </sub>poly(&#x3b3;-methyl L-glutamate)<sub>60</sub>]PLLZ<sub>25</sub>-PMLG<sub>60 </sub>can be synthesized by polymerizing N<sup>&#x3b5;</sup>-carbobenzoxy L-lysine N<sup>&#x3b1;</sup>-carboxy acid anhydride (LLZ-NCA) by using n-hexylamine as an initiator, and then polymerizing &#x3b3;-methyl L-glutamate N-carboxy acid anhydride (MLG-NCA).

<p id="P-00043" num="00043">Synthesis of the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide is not limited to the above-described method, and the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide can be synthesized by a genetic engineering method. Specifically, the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide can be manufactured by transforming a host cell by a expression vector in which is integrated a DNA which encodes the target polypeptide, and culturing the transformant, or the like.</p>
<p id="P-00044" num="00044">Examples of the expression vector include a plasmid vector, a fuzzy vector, a plasmid and fuzzy chimeric vector, and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00045" num="00045">Examples of the host cell include prokaryotic microorganisms such as <i>E. coli, Bacillus subtilis</i>, or the like; eukaryotic microorganisms such as yeast or the like; zooblasts, and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00046" num="00046">The &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide may be prepared by removing the &#x3b1;-helix structural portion from a natural fibrous protein such as &#x3b1;-keratin, myosin, epidermin, fibrinogen, tropomysin, silk fibroin, or the like.</p>
<p id="P-00047" num="heading-00047">{DNA}</p>
<p id="P-00048" num="00048">The DNA may be a single-stranded DNA. However, the DNA is preferably a double-stranded DNA from the standpoints that the rod-shape can be stably maintained, other substances can be intercalated into the interior of the molecule, and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00049" num="00049">A double-stranded DNA has a double helix structure in which two polynucleotide chains, which are in the form of right-wound spirals, are formed so as to be positioned around a single central axis in a state in which they extend in respectively opposite directions.</p>
<p id="P-00050" num="00050">The polynucleotide chains are formed by four types of nucleic acid bases which are adenine (A), thiamine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The nucleic acid bases in the polynucleotide chain exist in the form of projecting inwardly within a plane which is orthogonal to the central axis, and form so-called Watson-Crick base pairs. Thiamine specifically hydrogen bonds with adenine, and cytosine specifically hydrogen bonds with guanine. As a result, in a double-stranded DNA, the two polypeptide chains are bonded complementarily.</p>
<p id="P-00051" num="00051">The DNA can be prepared by known methods such as PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), LCR (Ligase Chain Reaction), 3SR (Self-Sustained Sequence Replication), SDA (Strand Displacement Amplification), and the like. Among these, the PCR method is preferable.</p>
<p id="P-00052" num="00052">Further, the DNA can be prepared by being directly removed enzymatically from a natural gene by a restriction enzyme. Or, the DNA can be prepared by a genetic cloning method, or by a chemical synthesis method.</p>
<p id="P-00053" num="00053">In the case of a genetic cloning method, a large amount of the DNA can be prepared by, for example, integrating a structure, in which a normal nucleic acid has been amplified, into a vector which is selected from plasmid vectors, fuzzy vectors, plasmid and fuzzy chimeric vectors, and the like, and then introducing the vector into an arbitrary host in which propagation is possible and which is selected from prokaryotic microorganisms such as <i>E. coli, Bacillus subtilis</i>, or the like; eukaryotic microorganisms such as yeast or the like; zooblasts, and the like.</p>
<p id="P-00054" num="00054">Examples of chemical synthesis methods include liquid phase methods or solid phase synthesis methods using an insoluble carrier, such as a tolyester method, a phosphorous acid method, or the like. In the case of a chemical synthesis method, the double-stranded DNA can be prepared by using a known automatic synthesizing device or the like to prepare a large amount of single-stranded DNA, and thereafter, carrying out annealing.</p>
<p id="P-00055" num="heading-00055">{Amylose}</p>
<p id="P-00056" num="00056">Amylose is a polysaccharide having a spiral structure in which D-glucose, which forms starch which is a homopolysaccharide of higher plants for storage, is joined in a straight chain by &#x3b1;-1,4 bonds.</p>
<p id="P-00057" num="00057">The molecular weight of the amylose is preferably around several thousand to 150,000 in number average molecular weight.</p>
<p id="P-00058" num="00058">The amylose may be a commercially available amylose, or may be appropriately prepared in accordance with known methods.</p>
<p id="P-00059" num="00059">Amylopectin may be contained in a portion of the amylose.</p>
<p id="P-00060" num="00060">The length of the rod-shaped body is not particularly limited, and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. However, from the standpoint of causing reflection of incident light as colored interference light, which will be described later, a length of 810 nm or less is preferable, and 10 nm to 810 nm is more preferable.</p>
<p id="P-00061" num="00061">The diameter of the rod-shaped body is not particularly limited, and is about 0.8 to 2.0 nm in the case of the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide.</p>
<p id="P-00062" num="00062">The entire rod-shaped body may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic. Or, the rod-shaped body may be amphiphilic such that a portion thereof is hydrophobic or hydrophilic, and the other portion thereof exhibits the opposite property of the one portion. In the case of an amphiphilic rod-shaped body, the numbers of the lipophilic (hydrophobic) portions and hydrophilic portions are not particularly limited, and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. Further, in this case, the portions which are lipophilic (hydrophobic) and the portions which are hydrophilic may be positioned alternately, or either type of portion may be positioned only at one end portion of the rod-shaped body.</p>
<p id="P-00063" num="00063">An example of an amphiphilic rod-shaped body is shown in FIG. <b>1</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a rod-shaped body <b>10</b> has a hydrophobic portion <b>10</b><i>a </i>at one end side thereof, and has a hydrophilic portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>at the other end side thereof.</p>
<p id="P-00064" num="heading-00064">&#x3c;Film&#x3e;</p>
<p id="P-00065" num="00065">The film reflects incident light as colored interference light.</p>
<p id="P-00066" num="00066">Reflection of the incident light as the colored interference light is a color formation (color of interference light) in which, when an external stimulus, such as an electric field, a magnetic field, heat, light (e.g., natural light, infrared light, ultraviolet light), or the like, is applied to the film, light of a specific wavelength is reflected in accordance with the thickness of the film and the refractive index thereof, on the basis of the multilayer thin-film interference theory which is the basic principle of color formation of the scaly powder of the wings of a Morpho butterfly. As a result, color formation (colored interference light) occurs at the surface of the film. The color tone can be arbitrarily controlled, like the epidermis of a chameleon, by the external stimulus.</p>
<p id="P-00067" num="00067">Hereinafter, the principles of light reflection of incident light as colored interference light will be explained.</p>
<p id="P-00068" num="00068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the wavelength (&#x3bb;) of the interference light due to the film of the rod-shaped body at the time when light is irradiated onto the film, is emphasized under the condition expressed by following (1), and is enfeebled under the condition expressed by following (2).

<p id="P-00070" num="00070">The thickness of the film is preferably 810 nm or less, and 10 nm to 810 nm is more preferable.</p>
<p id="P-00071" num="00071">By appropriately changing the thickness of the film, the color (wavelength) of the interference light can be changed. In this case, applications to color image formation and the like are possible.</p>
<p id="P-00072" num="00072">The film may be a monomolecular film, or may be a laminated film formed by monomolecular films.</p>
<p id="P-00073" num="00073">The monomolecular film or laminated film formed by monomolecular films can be formed, for example, in accordance with Longmuir-Blodgett's technique (the LB technique). At this time, a known LB film forming device (e.g., NL-LB400NK-MWC manufactured by Nippon Laser &#x26; Electronics Laboratories, Co., or the like is suitable) may be used.</p>
<p id="P-00074" num="00074">The formation of the monomolecular film can be carried out by, for example, forming the monomolecular film on a substrate <b>50</b> by using an extruder member <b>60</b> in a state in which lipophilic (hydrophobic) or amphiphilic rod-shaped bodies are floating on a water surface (on an aqueous phase), or in a state in which hydrophilic or amphiphilic rod-shaped bodies are floating on an oil surface (on an oil phase), i.e., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a state in which the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> are oriented. By repeating this operation, a laminated film, in which an arbitrary number of monomolecular films is laminated on the substrate <b>50</b>, can be formed. Note that fixing the monomolecular film or the laminated film to the substrate <b>50</b> is preferable from the standpoint that the light reflection of incident light as colored interference light by the monomolecular film or the laminated film can be manifested stably.</p>
<p id="P-00075" num="00075">The substrate <b>50</b> is not particularly limited, and the material, configuration, size, and the like thereof can be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. However, it is preferable that the surface thereof is subjected in advance to an appropriate surface treatment for the purpose of facilitating adhesion and bonding of the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> thereto. For example, in a case in which the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> (e.g., &#x3b1;-helix polypeptides) are hydrophilic, it is preferable to carry out in advance a surface treatment such as a hydrophilicizing treatment or the like using octadecyl/trimethyl siloxane or the like.</p>
<p id="P-00076" num="00076">When a monomolecular film of amphiphilic rod-shaped bodies is formed, the state of the rod-shaped bodies floating on an oil phase or an aqueous phase is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, such that, on the aqueous phase or the oil phase, the lipophilic portions (hydrophobic portions) <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> are oriented adjacent to one another, and the hydrophilic portions <b>10</b><i>b </i>are oriented adjacent to one another.</p>
<p id="P-00077" num="00077">The above is an example of a monomolecular film or a laminated film formed by monomolecular films, in which the rod-shaped bodies are oriented in the planar direction of the monomolecular film (i.e., are in a state of lying down sideways). However, a monomolecular film in which the rod-shaped bodies are oriented in the direction of thickness of the monomolecular film (i.e., are in a state of standing erect) can be formed as follows for example. Namely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, first, in a state in which the amphiphilic rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> (&#x3b1;-helix polypeptides) are floating on the water surface (on the aqueous phase) (i.e., in the state in which the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> are lying down sideways), the pH of the water (the aqueous phase) is made to be alkaline (about 12). Thus, the &#x3b1;-helix structures of the hydrophilic portions <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> (&#x3b1;-helix polypeptides) come undone and the hydrophilic portions <b>10</b><i>b </i>come to have random structures. At this time, the &#x3b1;-helix structures of the lipophilic portions (hydrophobic portions) <b>10</b><i>a </i>in the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> (&#x3b1;-helix polypeptides) are maintained as they are. Next, the pH of the water (the aqueous phase) is made to be acidic (about 5). Thus, the hydrophilic portions <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> (&#x3b1;-helix polypeptides) again assume &#x3b1;-helix structures. At this time, when a pushing member, which abuts the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> (&#x3b1;-helix polypeptides), pushes the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> (&#x3b1;-helix polypeptides) from the side surface of the pushing member due to air pressure, the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> remain in their erect state with respect to the water (the aqueous phase), and the hydrophilic portions <b>10</b><i>b </i>thereof are, in the aqueous phase, directed in a direction which is substantially orthogonal to the water surface and take on &#x3b1;-helix structures. Then, as was described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, by extruding the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> (&#x3b1;-helix polypeptides) on the substrate <b>50</b> by using the extruder member <b>60</b> in the state in which the rod-shaped bodies <b>10</b> (&#x3b1;-helix polypeptides) are oriented, the monomolecular film can be formed on the substrate <b>50</b>. By repeating this operation, a laminated film, in which an arbitrary number of monomolecular films is laminated, can be formed on the substrate <b>50</b>.</p>

The thickness of the film in the image forming element freely changes due to the change in the structure of the structure variable body.</p>
<p id="P-00104" num="00104">For example, if the rod-shaped bodies in the image forming element are an &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide and the structure variable bodies chemically bonded to the rod-shaped bodies are an azobenzene compound, in a state in which one end of the azobenzene compound chemically binds to one end of the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide and the other end of the azobenzene compound chemically binds to the substrate, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the azobenzene compound assumes a trans structure at the time when visible light is irradiated, and assumes a cis structure at the time when ultraviolet light is irradiated.

<p id="P-00107" num="heading-00107">{Image Forming Device}</p>
<p id="P-00108" num="00108">The image forming device of the present invention is equipped with at least the image forming element of the present invention, and a means for irradiating light for irradiating light onto the image forming element. In the case in which the image forming element has the structure variable body, the image forming device also comprises means for applying stimulus which applies a stimulus to the structure variable body, and has other means which are appropriately selected as needed.</p>
<p id="P-00109" num="00109">The image forming device is equipped with the image forming element as a pixel for image formation. The pixel may be formed by a single type of the image forming element, or may be formed by two or more types of the image forming element.</p>
<p id="P-00110" num="00110">In the latter case, it is preferable that the image forming device is formed by appropriately selecting the combination of wavelengths of the interference lights by the image forming elements which are used. Specifically, it is preferable that the image forming device is formed by using an image forming element which reflects incident light as blue interference light (a blue element), an image forming element which reflects incident light as green interference light (a green element), and an image forming element which reflects incident light as red interference light (a red element). In this case, the image forming device is preferable from the standpoint that the color formation of the pixels can be made to be full color. In this case, when the blue color element and the green color element reflect light, the pixel becomes cyan color, and when the blue element and the red element reflect light, the pixel becomes magenta color, and when the green element and the red element reflect light, the pixel becomes yellow color.</p>
<p id="P-00111" num="00111">In the present invention, when the color of the interference light is blue, it suffices that the wavelength of the interference light is in a wavelength region generally exhibiting blue, and is, for example, a wavelength in a region which is about 400 nm or more and less than 500 nm. When the color of the interference light is green, it suffices that the wavelength of the interference light is in a wavelength region generally exhibiting green, and is, for example, a wavelength in a region which is about 500 nm or more and less than 600 nm.

<p id="P-00115" num="00115">It is preferable that the driving of the means for applying stimulus is controlled by a means for controlling such as a computer or the like.</p>
<p id="P-00116" num="00116">The mode of the image forming device is not particularly limited, and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. For example, a mode in which the image forming element reflects, as interference light, light which is irradiated by the means for irradiating light, and the wavelength of the interference light is 300 to 810 nm is preferable.</p>
<p id="P-00117" num="00117">Further, a mode is preferable in which the image forming device has, as the image forming elements, at least an image forming element which reflects incident light as blue interference light, an image forming element which reflects incident light as green interference light, and an image forming element which reflects incident light as red interference light, and the pixel is formed by these image forming elements.</p>

<p id="P-00119" num="00119">In addition, a mode is preferable in which the image forming device has the means for applying stimulus, and has a plurality of pixels which have at least an image forming element (hereinafter, &#x201c;blue element&#x201d;) for reflecting incident light as blue interference light in a case in which the structure variable body has a first structure and for reflecting incident light as colorless light in a case in which the structure variable body has a second structure (meaning a case in which the interference light is light other than visible light; the same holds hereinafter), and an image forming element (hereinafter, &#x201c;green element&#x201d;) for reflecting incident light as green interference light in a case in which the structure variable body has a first structure and for reflecting incident light as colorless interference light in a case in which the structure variable body has a second structure, and an image forming element (hereinafter, &#x201c;red element&#x201d;) for reflecting incident light as red interference light in a case in which the structure variable body has a first structure and for reflecting incident light as colorless interference light in a case in which the structure variable body has a second structure. In other words, a mode in which the image forming device has a plurality of pixels, which have a blue element and a green element and a red element, is preferable.</p>
<p id="P-00120" num="00120">In the case of this mode, when the means for applying stimulus applies a blue color forming stimulus, a green color forming stimulus, and a red color quenching stimulus, at the pixel, cyan color is exhibited by synthesis of the formed colors of blue and green. When the means for applying stimulus applies a blue color forming stimulus, a green color quenching stimulus, and a red color forming stimulus, at the pixel, magenta color is exhibited by synthesis of the formed colors of blue and red. When the means for applying stimulus applies a blue color quenching stimulus, a green color forming stimulus and a red color forming stimulus, at the pixel, yellow color is exhibited by the synthesis of the formed colors of green and red. When the means for applying stimulus applies a blue color forming stimulus, a green color forming stimulus, and a red color forming stimulus, at the pixel, white is exhibited by the synthesis of the formed colors of blue, green and red. When the means for applying stimulus applies a blue color quenching stimulus, a green color quenching stimulus, and a red color quenching stimulus, at the pixel, no color is formed, and the black color of the substrate is exhibited. Accordingly, the image forming device is preferable from the standpoint that formation of a full color image is possible by combining these pixels.</p>
<p id="P-00121" num="00121">Because the image forming device uses the image forming element of the present invention, the image forming device is easy to manufacture, can form images easily and at a low cost, is stable without the fear of causing environmental problems at the time of disposal, can form color images, and can be suitably used in various fields of image formation.</p>

The means for irradiating light irradiates light onto the image forming element. Thus, when the film in the image forming element has the first thickness, it reflects incident light as colored interference light based on the multilayer thin-film interference theory which is the basic principle of color formation of the scaly powder of the wings of a Morpho butterfly.

When the film has the second thickness, the film reflects colorless interference light, i.e., reflects light which is other than visible light and which cannot be visually perceived. Thus, color formation (colored interference light) does not occur.</p>
<p id="P-00164" num="00164">When the means for applying stimulus applies a stimulus for green element color formation (hereinafter, this stimulus will be called &#x201c;green color formation stimulus&#x201d;), in the same way as in the case of the blue element, the light irradiated onto the film in the green element is reflected as green interference light. Thus, color formation of green color occurs at the surface of the film. On the other hand, the means for applying stimulus applies a stimulus for green element color quenching. (Hereinafter, this stimulus will be called &#x201c;green color quenching stimulus&#x201d;.) Thus, the thickness of the film in the green element changes to the second thickness. When the film has the second thickness, the film reflects colorless interference light, i.e., reflects light which is other than visible light and which cannot be perceived visually. Thus, color formation (colored interference light) does not occur.</p>
<p id="P-00165" num="00165">When the means for applying stimulus applies a stimulus for red element color formation (hereinafter, this stimulus will be called &#x201c;red color formation stimulus&#x201d;), in the same way as in the case of the blue element, the light irradiated onto the film in the red element is reflected as red interference light. Thus, color formation of red color occurs at the surface of the film. On the other hand, the means for applying stimulus applies a stimulus for red element color quenching. (Hereinafter, this stimulus will be called &#x201c;red color quenching stimulus&#x201d;.) Thus, the thickness of the film in the red element changes to the second thickness. When the film has the second thickness, the film reflects colorless interference light, i.e., reflects light which is other than visible light and which cannot be visually perceived. Thus, color formation (colored interference light) does not occur.</p>
<p id="P-00166" num="00166">Thus, when the means for applying stimulus applies a blue color forming stimulus, a green color forming stimulus, and a red color quenching stimulus, at the pixel, cyan color is formed by mixing the blue interference light and the green interference light. When the means for applying stimulus applies a blue color forming stimulus, a green color quenching stimulus, and a red color forming stimulus, at the pixel, magenta color is formed by mixing of the blue interference light and the red interference light. When the means for applying stimulus applies a blue color quenching stimulus, a green color forming stimulus and a red color forming stimulus, at the pixel, yellow color is formed by mixing the green interference light and the red interference light. When the means for applying stimulus applies a blue color forming stimulus, a green color forming stimulus, and a red color forming stimulus, at the pixel, white is formed by mixing the blue interference light, the green interference light and the red interference light. When the means for applying stimulus applies a blue color quenching stimulus, a green color quenching stimulus, and a red color quenching stimulus, at the pixel, no color is formed, and the black color of the substrate is exhibited. Accordingly, at the image forming device, formation of a full color image is possible by combining these pixels.</p>
<p id="P-00167" num="00167">Hereinafter, Examples of the present invention will be explained. However, the present invention is not in any way to be limited to these Examples.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e3110" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="P-00168" num="00168">A monomolecular film of an &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide was formed on a substrate, and thereon, another monomolecular film which was the same was layered, so as to form a laminated film. An image forming element of the present invention was thus prepared.</p>
<p id="P-00169" num="00169">As will be described hereinafter, it was confirmed that the image forming element reflected light as colored interference light. The relationship between the colored interference light reflected and the number of layered monomolecular films of the image forming element was also investigated.</p>
<p id="P-00170" num="00170">A poly(n-hexyl L-glutamate), whose monomer unit was a structure in which the hydrogen atom of the carboxyl group of the glutamic acid was substituted by an n-hexyl group (hereinafter this compound is called &#x201c;PHeLG&#x201d; upon occasion), was used as the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide. This PHeLG was obtained by a polymerization reaction of L-glutamic acid.&#x3b3;-methylester using benzyl amine as a polymerization initiator. The degree of polymerization was 114 as measured by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR measurement. The substrate was a silicon substrate (manufactured by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.) which was subjected to a surface treatment by using octadecyl trimethoxysilane (manufactured by Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd.). The molecular film was formed by using an LB film forming device (NL-LB400NK-MWC manufactured by Nippon Laser &#x26; Electronics Laboratory, Co.). In the PHeLG, the pitch of the spiral of the &#x3b1;-helix was 0.15 (nm/amino acid residue), and the diameter of the &#x3b1;-helix was 1.5 (nm).</p>
<p id="P-00171" num="00171">When the FT-IR spectrum of a laminated film in which 120 of the molecular films were laminated was measured, four peaks were obtained. One was a peak of 1738 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>based on the C&#x2550;O group of the side chain. Another was a strong peak of 1656 cm<sup>&#x3c;1 </sup>based on the amide group I in the &#x3b1;-helix structure. Yet another was a small, weak peak of 1626 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>based on the amide group I in the &#x3b2;-structure. The last was a peak of 1551 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>based on the amide group II in the &#x3b1;-helix structure. From these results of measurement of the FT-IR spectrum, it was confirmed that the PHeLG molecule maintains its &#x3b1;-helix structure in the monomolecular film.</p>
<p id="P-00172" num="00172">The thickness of a laminated film when 20 monomolecular films formed by PHeLG were laminated was 32 mm. Thus, the thickness of each monomolecular film formed by PHeLG (i.e., each layer) was 1.6 nm.</p>
<p id="P-00173" num="00173">Next, the relationship between the number of layers in the laminated film formed by the monomolecular films and the colored interference light reflection was investigated. Laminated films formed by layering 60, 70 and 80 monomolecular films, respectively, exhibited the visible light reflection spectra shown in FIG. <b>11</b>. Further, a laminated film in which 40 to 50 monomolecular films were layered reflected light as colored interference light of brown color. A laminated film in which 60 to 70 monomolecular films were layered exhibited dark blue (a deep blue). A laminated film in which 80 to 100 monomolecular films were layered exhibited light blue (a weak blue). A laminated film in which up to around 120 monomolecular films were layered exhibited yellow color. A laminated film in which up to 160 monomolecular films were layered exhibited red-violet.</p>
<p id="P-00174" num="00174">Specifically, the visible light reflection spectra of a laminated film in which 40 monomolecular films were layered, a laminated film in which 80 monomolecular films were layered, and a laminated film in which 120 monomolecular films were layered, are shown in FIG. <b>12</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the reflectance (%) of the laminated film in which 80 films were layered exhibited a maximum peak at 418 nm, and this laminated film became blue. Further, the reflectance (%) of the laminated film in which 40 films were layered exhibited a minimum at 456 nm, and this laminated film became brown (dark orange) which is a complementary color of blue. The reflectance (%) of the laminated film in which 120 films were layered exhibited a maximum peak at 619 nm, the reflectance (%) exhibited a minimum at 409 nm, and the laminated film became yellow color based on the emphasized light of 619 nm rather than the enfeebled light of a wavelength of 409 nm.</p>
<p id="P-00175" num="00175">The wavelength (&#x3bb;) of the visible light reflection spectrum was affected by the angle of incidence (&#x3b1;) of the light onto the laminated film formed by the monomolecular films. The condition under which the wavelength (&#x3bb;) was emphasized is as per following (1), and the condition under which the wavelength (&#x3bb;) was enfeebled is as per following (2).

(The lines of the three types of results of computation substantially overlap one another.)</p>
<p id="P-00179" num="00179">From the above results, it can be understood that, when the image forming element of Example 1 was used, a color image could be formed.</p>
<heading id="heading-d0e3456" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="P-00180" num="00180">First, &#x3b1;-helix copolypeptide PLLZ<sub>25</sub>-P(MLG<sub>42</sub>/LGA<sub>18</sub>) was prepared as follows as the &#x3b1;-helix polypeptide which was the rod-shaped body. Namely, the polymerization of N<sup>&#x3b5;</sup>-carbobenzoxy L-lysine N<sup>&#x3b1;</sup>-carboxy acid anhydride (LLZ-NCA) was carried out by using n-hexylamine as an initiator. Next, by polymerizing &#x3b3;-methyl L-glutamate N-carboxy acid anhydride (MLG-NCA), a block copolypeptide PLLZ<sub>x</sub>-PMLG<sub>y</sub>, in which the degree of polymerization of the PLLZ portion was x and the degree of polymerization of the PMLG portion was y, was prepared. Thereafter, the PMLG segment was partially hydrolysized and made to be L-glutamic acid (LGA), such that &#x3b1;-helix copolypeptide PLLZ<sub>x</sub>-P(MLG<sub>y</sub>/LGA<sub>z</sub>) was prepared.</p>
<p id="P-00181" num="00181">Then, azobenzene compound was bonded to one end of the &#x3b1;-helix copolypeptide PLLZ<sub>x</sub>-P(MLG<sub>y</sub>/LGA<sub>z</sub>), and this azobenzene compound was fixed to the substrate used in Example 1. A plurality of these structures were oriented such that a molecular film was formed. An image forming element was thereby prepared.</p>
<p id="P-00182" num="00182">Three types of image forming elements were obtained whose degrees of polymerization of the &#x3b1;-helix copolypeptide were set in the range of 260 to 5400, and the obtained image forming elements had three types of thicknesses. One type of image forming element was an image forming element (hereinafter &#x201c;blue element&#x201d;) in which the color of the interference light when the azobenzene compound had a trans structure was blue (the wavelength of the interference light was about 400 nm or more to less than 500 nm), and in which the color of the interference light when the azobenzene compound had a cis structure was colorless (the wavelength of the interference light was other than 300 to 810 nm). Another type was an image forming element (hereinafter &#x201c;green element&#x201d;) in which the color of the interference light when the azobenzene compound had a trans structure was green (the wavelength of the interference light was about 500 nm or more to less than 600 nm), and in which the color of the interference light when the azobenzene compound had a cis structure was colorless (the wavelength of the interference light was other than 300 to 810 nm). The final type was an image forming element (hereinafter &#x201c;red element&#x201d;) in which the color of the interference light when the azobenzene compound had a trans structure was red (the wavelength of the interference light was about 600 nm or more to less than 700 nm), and in which the color of the interference light when the azobenzene compound had a cis structure was colorless (the wavelength of the interference light was other than 300 to 810 nm).</p>
<p id="P-00183" num="00183">The image forming device of Example 2 had a plurality of pixels having the above-described blue elements, green elements and red elements. Further, the image forming device was equipped with, as the means for irradiating light, a light source which irradiated visible light onto these elements, and, as a means for applying stimulus, a light source (stimulus applying light source) which switchably irradiated visible light and ultraviolet light onto the azobenzene compound in these elements. Note that these two light sources were designed such that the driving thereof could be controlled by a computer.</p>
<p id="P-00184" num="00184">In the image forming device, the stimulus applying light source irradiated visible light as the blue color forming stimulus. Thus, the azobenzene compound in the blue element changed to a trans structure. As a result, the thickness of the film in the blue element changed. Accompanying the changes of the azobenzene compound between the trans structure and the cis structure, the thickness of the film changes reversibly between two thicknesses which are a thickness in the case in which the azobenzene compound in the blue element is a trans structure and the thickness when the azobenzene compound is a cis structure. The light source irradiated visible light onto the blue element. Thus, at the time when the thickness of the film in the blue element was the thickness in the case in which the azobenzene compound was the trans structure, blue interference light was reflected from the film. Thus, blue color formation (blue interference light) occurred at the surface of the film. On the other hand, when the stimulus applying light source irradiated ultraviolet light as the blue color quenching stimulus, the azobenzene compound in the blue element changed from a trans structure to a cis structure. As a result, the thickness of the film in the blue element changed to the thickness at the time when the azobenzene compound is a cis structure. At the time when the thickness of the film was the thickness in the case in which the azobenzene compound was the cis structure, the film reflected colorless interference light. Namely, light other than visible light was reflected, and thus, reflection of incident light as colored interference light did not occur.</p>
<p id="P-00185" num="00185">When the stimulus applying light source irradiated visible light as the green color forming stimulus, in the same way as in the case of the blue element, the light irradiated onto the film in the green element was reflected as green interference light. Thus, green color formation (green interference light) occurred at the surface of the film. On the other hand, when the stimulus applying light source irradiated ultraviolet light as the green color quenching stimulus, the thickness of the film in the green element changed to the thickness in the case in which the azobenzene compound was a cis structure. In this case, because the film reflected colorless interference light, i.e., because light other than visible light was reflected, the reflection of incident light as colored interference light did not occur.</p>
<p id="P-00186" num="00186">When the stimulus applying light source irradiated visible light as the red color forming stimulus, in the same way as in the case of the blue element, the light irradiated onto the film in the red element was reflected as red interference light. Thus, red color formation (red interference light) occurred at the surface of the film. On the other hand, when the stimulus applying light source irradiated ultraviolet light as the red color quenching stimulus, the thickness of the film in the red element changed to the thickness in the case in which the azobenzene compound was a cis structure. In this case, because the film reflected colorless interference light, i.e., because light other than visible light was reflected, color formation (colored interference light) did not occur.</p>
<p id="P-00187" num="00187">In the image forming device, it was confirmed that when the stimulus applying light source applied the blue color forming stimulus, the green color forming stimulus, and the red color quenching stimulus, and the light source irradiated visible light onto the pixel, at the pixel, cyan color was formed by mixing the blue interference light and the green interference light.</p>
<p id="P-00188" num="00188">In the image forming device, it was confirmed that when the stimulus applying light source applied the blue color forming stimulus, the green color quenching stimulus, and the red color forming stimulus, and the light source irradiated visible light onto the pixel, at the pixel, magenta color was formed by mixing the blue interference light and the red interference light.</p>
<p id="P-00189" num="00189">In the image forming device, it was confirmed that when the stimulus applying light source applied the blue color quenching stimulus, the green color forming stimulus, and the red color forming stimulus, and the light source irradiated visible light onto the pixel, at the pixel, yellow color was by mixing the green interference light and the red interference light.</p>
<p id="P-00190" num="00190">When color formation control of these pixels was carried out simultaneously, a full color image could be formed.</p>
