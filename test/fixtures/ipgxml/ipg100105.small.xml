<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to direction indicators associated with a firehose to assist a firefighter in safe egress from a smoke-filled building using the firehose.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A primary concern of fire fighting personnel is that of becoming lost in a burning or smoke-filled structure where the firefighter does not know the direction to the outside. Firefighters are commonly taught to follow the firehose lines, knowing that the firehose connects from an outside source of water to the water spraying nozzle. However, under the stresses and pressures of a fire emergency, a firefighter may lose his/her sense of direction, and upon finding a firehose may be unable to conclude which direction leads to the outside water source and which direction leads to the nozzle. As explained in U.S. Pat. No. 4,844,000, innumerable other problems can arise which further minimize the chances of a safe escape.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 4,844,000, issued Jul. 4, 1989 to Clement, describes a flexible band or clamp with directional fingers protruding perpendicularly from the band. The band is attached to the firehose and helps indicate the direction to the water source of the firehose. The clamp of the '000 patent allows a firefighter to feel along the firehose and determine the direction to the exit. The clamp is a flexible removable band which must be retrofitted along the length of the firehose. The embodiments described include a steel spring clamp capable of being slipped over an unrolled firehose and a flexible band with fastener which encircles the firehose and may remain on a stored firehose. U.S. Des. Pat. No. 312,390 issued Nov. 7, 1990 and U.S. Des. Pat. No. 345,519 issued Mar. 29, 1994, both to Clement, show various embodiments of the directional bands as essentially described in Clement's '000 patent.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Problems are inherent in a device which must be attached by encircling a firehose. Such a device must be able to withstand heat, withstand sudden expansion or change in shape caused by the high water pressure through a firehose, withstand abuse to its surface when being dragged over rough surfaces, and avoid snagging objects and hampering movement of the firehose. Yet, simultaneously, the device must also be able to remain sufficiently flexible to allow the firehouse to be stored in a flattened coil or roll, avoid restriction of water flow by kinking a firehose, and more importantly, withstand being dislodged or removed through abuse of the hose so that the device is there when the firefighter needs it.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,027,741, issued Jul. 2, 1991 to Smith et al., addresses many of these problems in two embodiments of an emergency escape firehose. The '741 embodiments incorporate stiff bristles permanently interwoven at an angle into the canvas surface of a firehose. In the first embodiment, the bristles' angle points towards the water connection source of the firehose thereby enabling a firefighter to feel a smooth surface in that direction and a resistant surface in the opposite direction towards the nozzle connection. In the second embodiment, the bristle angles are reversely inclined and the firefighter must know that the direction towards the resistant feel of the firehose will lead him to the water source connection.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when a firefighter is faced with an extreme emergency or panic circumstance, a safety escape device should also be intuitive to use so as to minimize the need for use of cognitive skills. A rookie firefighter trying to remember whether the rough direction is to the nozzle (i.e., the fire) or to the water source has no intuitive clues whether &#x201c;smooth&#x201d; is out or &#x201c;rough&#x201d; is out. In contrast, a pointer or directional arrow provides intuitive understanding.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The third and fourth embodiments of the '741 patent include a series of annular members attached to the outer surface of the firehose wherein the annular member is inclined to indicate direction. A fifth and sixth embodiment include application of a luminous tapered stripe to the firehose. While these embodiments are more intuitive, they too have the same problems and disadvantages as previously noted.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,890 describes a firehose coupling comprising male and female components which thread together to connect firehose sections. The male coupling component always indicates the direction of water flow. The '890 patent discloses an elongated extension integrally attached to each lug of a male component of a firehose coupling. Such lugs are costly to manufacture and require large capital expenditures to provide new coupling sets to equip many firehoses for a large city fire department.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 6,766,761, incorporated herein by reference, addresses many shortcomings with a firehose coupling exit indicator which is secured between the male and female hose coupler ends. The indicator includes a plastic ring which fits between and is captured by the mated male and female coupler hose ends which has integral triangular fingers that extend from the ring along the outer surface of the male hose coupler end. The triangular fingers act as arrows which point the way to the firehose source and building exit to aid the firefighter in egress.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. Patent Application Publication U.S. 2007/0063512A1, incorporated herein by reference, addresses additional safety features which further increase the effectiveness and sturdiness of the fire hose coupling indicator of the '761 patent.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">3. Identification of Objects of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An object of the invention is to accomplish one or more of the following:</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Provide a direction indicating device at the coupling between firehose sections that is inexpensive to manufacture, yet provides a reliable indicator toward the hose source for a firefighter in a dark, smoke-filled building;</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Provide an inexpensive direction indicating device that can be attached to couplings of existing firehoses so that entire new couplings need not be purchased;</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Provide a direction indicating device at the coupling between firehose sections that provides a reliable tactile indicator of the firehose source direction for a firefighter wearing the thick gloves of a firefighting ensemble in a dark, smoke-filled building;</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Provide a direction indicating device at the coupling between firehose sections that provides a reliable visual indicator toward the hose source for a firefighter in a dark, smoke-filled building;</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Provide a direction indicating device at the coupling between firehose sections that is arranged and designed to prevent foreign objects or debris from becoming entangled with the device; and</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Provide a direction indicating device at the coupling between firehose sections that is arranged and designed to prevent the unintended removal of the device while connecting and disconnecting the coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the following specifications and drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The objects identified above, along with other advantages and features, are preferably embodied in an annular direction indicating device which fits over the male threads of a male coupling of a firehose. The direction indicating device has integral indicating fingers which point backward from the coupling toward the hose source. Such fingers fit in the gaps of the lugs of the male coupling. The fingers preferably are shaped like arrowheads and have deep arrow-shaped relief grooves or raised ridges on the outer faces so that a firefighter can easily determine by feel the direction to which they are pointing. The fingers of the device may increase in thickness toward the pointed end and may extend longitudinally well beyond the male hose coupler end to provide a further tactile indicator of the direction toward the firehose source. The device also preferably has a lip or rim on the inwardly facing surface of each finger positioned at or near the tip, which prevents the device from being unintentionally removed from the male coupling while connecting or disconnecting the male and female couplings. Alternatively, or additionally, the fingers may be sloped or curved inwardly toward the male coupling and/or firehose section such that the fingers of the device must be spread apart from each other in order to remove the device from the male coupling. Inwardly sloped or curved fingers, especially at their pointed ends or tips, also assist in preventing the fingers from becoming entangled with foreign objects or debris during firehose use. The direction indicating device is preferably made of a strong engineering thermoplastic, polycarbonate, and/or rubber material which includes luminescent, phosphorescent, fluorescent and/or reflective particles therein for enhanced visual indication of the direction towards safety. The raised or recessed arrowhead-shaped indicia may have a coating which is in sharp contrast to the outward-facing surfaces of the fingers for additional visual recognition.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate the firehose direction indicating device <b>10</b> according to a preferred implementation of the invention. The indicating device <b>10</b> includes a generally planar annular body <b>20</b> with aperture <b>21</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the annular body has a first face <b>76</b> from which a plurality of arrowhead-shaped circumferential fingers <b>22</b> extend perpendicularly in a common direction from the plane of body <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show three fingers <b>22</b>, but a different number of fingers may be suitable. Preferably, fingers <b>22</b> are integral with body <b>20</b> and are circumferentially spaced about body <b>20</b> so as to define an equal number of narrow slots <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Ideally, each finger <b>22</b> has an irregular pentagon shape defined by a first, base edge <b>90</b> (formed by a circumferential portion of body <b>20</b>), second and third side edges <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> which extend perpendicularly to the plane of body <b>20</b>, and fourth and fifth edges <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> which close the pentagon and generally form an arrowhead shape. The tips <b>80</b> of fingers <b>22</b> (defined by the apex portion of the fourth and fifth edges <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>), and other vertices, may be slightly rounded if desired. Furthermore, the fingers <b>22</b> may be thicker at the tip <b>80</b> than they are near body <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the fingers <b>22</b> each have an inner lip or rim <b>81</b> positioned at or near tips <b>80</b>. The inner lip or rim <b>81</b> projects inwardly from the inwardly facing surface <b>85</b> of fingers <b>22</b> toward the coupling system (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>). The inner lip <b>81</b> may be formed from a separate structure that is connected to the inwardly facing surface <b>85</b> of finger <b>22</b> or the inner lip <b>81</b> may be integrally formed from the finger <b>22</b> itself, such as by notching the inwardly facing surface <b>85</b> of finger <b>22</b> to create an inwardly projecting structure of finger <b>22</b> at or near tip <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, annular body <b>20</b> has an obverse face <b>78</b> opposite to the first face <b>76</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The obverse face preferably includes a circular recess <b>88</b> centered in annular body <b>20</b> which accommodates the annular shoulder <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of female coupler <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>) and allows for hand or spanner wrench tightening to prevent water leaks at the coupler connection.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, each finger <b>22</b> preferably includes an indicium <b>82</b> on its outward-facing surface <b>86</b>. The indicia <b>82</b> are ideally shaped to resemble an arrowhead pointing in the same direction as the arrowhead-shaped fingers <b>22</b>. Each indicium <b>82</b> is preferably a recess formed by a wide and deep groove so that its direction can be readily identified even by a firefighter wearing the thick gloves of a firefighting ensemble. Alternatively, the indicia <b>82</b> may be raised above (not illustrated) the outward-facing surfaces <b>86</b> of fingers <b>22</b> in such a manner as to promote identification of the arrowhead direction by a firefighter.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref> illustrate how the direction indicating device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is used in conjunction with a firehose coupling assembly. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the body <b>20</b> is like a gasket in that it extends over the end of male coupler <b>30</b> at the end of a hose section <b>50</b> with aperture <b>21</b> receiving the male threads <b>32</b>. The first face <b>76</b> of body <b>20</b> abuts the annular shoulder <b>33</b> of male coupler <b>30</b>. The direction-indicating fingers <b>22</b> are spaced about body <b>20</b> so as to fit between and partially abut lugs <b>34</b> of male coupler <b>30</b>, covering a portion of the interposal coupler surfaces <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) (defined between two adjacent lugs <b>34</b>). In other words, the lugs <b>34</b> of male coupler <b>30</b> are received into fitted slots <b>84</b>. Three lugs <b>34</b> are common for firehouse couplers, so three direction indicating fingers are provided for such couplers, but four fingers are provided for couplers with four lugs, etc. Preferably, arrowhead fingers <b>22</b> have increasing thickness toward their tips <b>80</b>, but the thickness is arranged so that the arrowhead fingers <b>22</b> do not extend radially beyond the radial extent of the coupling lugs, so that the fingers will be protected from damage during use.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The inner lip or rim <b>81</b> of fingers <b>22</b> allows the direction indicating device <b>10</b> to come into contact with the male coupling <b>30</b> or hose section <b>50</b> during coupling connection and disconnection, thereby preventing or hindering the device <b>10</b> from slipping off or otherwise becoming unintentionally removed. Additionally, or alternatively, the fingers <b>22</b> may extend from first face <b>76</b> at an acute angle, or in other words, the fingers may slope or curve inwardly toward the male coupler <b>30</b> or coupling system when the direction indicating device <b>10</b> is positioned thereon (i.e., the fingers <b>22</b> may have an acute angular slope toward each other), such that the fingers <b>22</b> of the device <b>10</b> must be spread apart from each other in order to remove the device <b>10</b> from the coupling system.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, coupled hose sections <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are selectively connected to each other by male and female threaded couplers <b>30</b>, <b>36</b>. The annular body <b>20</b> of indicating device <b>10</b> is captured between annular shoulders <b>33</b>, <b>38</b> of couplers <b>30</b>, <b>36</b> when the female threads <b>31</b> of coupler <b>36</b> are threaded onto the male threads <b>32</b> of coupler <b>30</b>. The integral fingers <b>22</b> fit between lugs <b>34</b> of the male coupler <b>30</b> and point toward the firehose water source (i.e., the fire plug) and away from the end of the hose where a nozzle is typically provided and carried to the fire inside a building.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the firehouse coupling assembly with direction indicator device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> when the female coupler <b>36</b> is threaded about the male coupler <b>30</b>. For clarity, the firehose sections <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> are not illustrated, and the internal serrated barbed surface <b>102</b> of male coupler <b>30</b> which captures the fabric firehose is visible. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is desirable for fingers <b>22</b> to cover the entire circumferential portion of male couple body <b>30</b> near body <b>20</b>, or as much as possible, to provide structural strength. By positioning lugs <b>34</b> between finger sides <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, or in other words, by providing fitted slots <b>84</b> to receive lugs <b>34</b>, the finger-body interface is made stronger by having fingers of longer length and of greater amount of radial curvature; thus, fingers <b>22</b> are less likely to break apart from body <b>20</b> if they snag on an object as the firehose is being dragged. Fingers <b>22</b> also preferably have an increased thickness for strength and rigidity. Therefore, the depth of the slots <b>84</b> is ideally short enough to allow clearance for spanner wrenches to easily engage lugs <b>34</b>. In other words, side edges <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> are designed to be long enough to provide finger strength, but short enough to provide spanner wrench clearance space <b>100</b> around each lug <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, inwardly sloping or curved fingers <b>22</b>, especially near their pointed edges or tips <b>80</b>, assist in preventing the fingers <b>22</b>, and the device <b>10</b> itself, from becoming entangled with foreign objects or debris during firehose use.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the assembled firehose coupling of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> showing the indicator device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> captured between the male and female coupler sections. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the thickness of annular body <b>20</b> between the first and obverse faces <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> along the perimeter radially outward of recess <b>88</b> is great enough to provide overall strength and rigidity. However, recess <b>88</b> is provided on the obverse face <b>78</b> of body <b>20</b> to accommodate female coupler <b>36</b> by receiving its shoulder <b>38</b>. Recess <b>88</b> allows for complete engagement of threads <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> either by hand or spanner wrench thereby preventing water leaks at the coupler connection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also illustrates the serrated barbed inner surface <b>103</b> of female coupler <b>36</b> which captures the fabric firehose.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With the direction indicating device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> supplied at each hose section coupling, a firefighter in a dark smoke-filled burning building can find a firehose and feel for the couplings, and upon feeling or seeing the arrowhead-like fingers <b>22</b> between lugs <b>34</b> or the arrowhead-like indicia <b>82</b> on the outward-facing surface <b>86</b> of the fingers <b>22</b>, immediately know the direction to the firehose water source and away from the nozzle of the hose. Furthermore, because the tips <b>80</b> of fingers <b>22</b> may extend well beyond the generally cylindrical body of male coupler <b>30</b>, even a firefighter wearing the densest and/or thickest gloves can detect their presence beyond the coupling to determine the direction to safety.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates several alternative implementations of the invention. While the tips <b>80</b> of direction indicating device <b>10</b> preferably extend longitudinally past the male coupler <b>30</b> body for ready tactile identification as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the tips <b>80</b> may be arranged and designed to not extend longitudinally past the male coupler <b>30</b> body as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The arrowhead-shaped indicia <b>82</b> may also be raised above the outward facing surface <b>86</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> rather than being formed by a recessed groove as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The outward facing surface <b>86</b> may be molded to form a texture <b>87</b> for improved tactile recognition, or alternatively, texture <b>87</b> may be formed by applying rough coating to or by machining or knurling the outward facing surface <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The direction indicating device <b>10</b> described and illustrated herein can be manufactured relatively inexpensively by injection molding techniques using a suitable plastic or rubber material. Strong engineering thermoplastics such as polysulfone, acetal, polycarbonate, and polyetheretherketone may be particularly desirable, because they have excellent strength, impact and abrasion resistance, and high temperature stability.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although the plastic or rubber material can be of bright colors such as yellow or orange to help the firefighters see the arrowhead fingers in limited light, the plastic may also include phosphorescent, fluorescent, and/or reflective particles therein for enhanced visual identification. More preferably still, the plastic includes luminescent material therein so that indicator <b>10</b> glows in the dark. Alternatively, a luminescent, phosphorescent, fluorescent, and/or reflective coating may be applied to the indicator <b>10</b>, or a portion thereof. For example, indicator <b>10</b> may be manufactured of a luminescent glow-in-the-dark plastic material, while indicia grooves <b>82</b> may be coated with a contrasting, fluorescent and reflective material, including reflective tape, to stand out clearly from the luminescent outward-facing finger surfaces <b>86</b>. Preferably, indicia <b>82</b> will be in contrast to the outward-facing finger surfaces <b>86</b> in both light and dark conditions.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cannula which is provided with a pair of nares which each have a primary aperture or opening formed in an end surface or wall thereof defining a primary flow path into and out of the nare for supplying a desired gas to a nostril of a patient, withdrawing or sampling a desired gas from a nostril of a patient (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), detecting changes in pressure within the nostril as the patient breathing, etc., and is further provided with at least one additional secondary opening(s), within at least one and preferably both of the nares, for providing a secondary flow passage into and out of the nare for supplying a desired gas to a nostril of a patient, withdrawing a desired gas from a nostril of a patient (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory airwaves and airflow), or detecting changes in pressure as the patient breathing, etc., in the event that the primary breathing path becomes occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise either partially or fully obstructed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The practice of measuring end-tidal carbon dioxide during the administration of anesthesia, particularly regional anesthesia, has grown markedly in the past several years. The reasons that anaesthesiologists have embraced this technique are described more fully in U.S. Pat. No. 5,335,656 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The preferred nasal cannula used in this procedure is a cannula which insufflates the patient with oxygen through one nare of a cannula and separately samples the exhaled gases by drawing the exhaled gas from the other nare into a conventional carbon dioxide analyzer. The cannula is preferably provided with an internal wall, a partition, a barrier or a system in the face piece to keep the conduits completely separate from one another for insufflation and sampling, however, separate lines can be used or even multiple nares for insufflation and sampling, though the latter device substantially increases the risk of gases mixing which can distort the readings for end-tidal carbon dioxide. It is preferred that two nares only are employed and that each nare performs only one function, i.e., insufflation or sampling into or from separate nostrils, detecting pressure or breathing characteristics, etc. Likewise, insufflation has normally been continuous, however, it could advantageously be intermittent which would further improve the end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement by insuring that gases being sampled where representative of exhaled gases undiluted by the other gases being insufflated. Most preferably, the intermittent insufflation is accomplished by the apparatus and method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,131 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other so-called demand insufflation devices which being insufflation upon the start of inhalation can also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Normal nasal cannulae are designed with the nares having a slight inward curvature as the nares extend upward from the face piece. This is anatomically desirable and important for imparting the proper direction of the insufflating gas into the nasal cavities, receiving the sampled gas(es) from the patient, detecting pressure or breathing characteristics of the patient, etc. When the patient is in the upright sitting position or ambulatory, this is the most satisfactory design configuration. Conversely, problems can be encountered if the patient is horizontal or prone and tends to accumulate secretions in the nasal cavities. It can be a particularly vexing problem if either the insufflation or sampling nare becomes occluded during the use of the cannula for sampling, monitoring end-tidal carbon dioxide during the administration of anesthesia, detecting pressure or breathing characteristics of a patient, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One problem which can readily occur during use of a cannular positioned in the nostrils of a patient is that the primary opening, formed in the remote end wall or surface, of one or both of the nares may become either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed by, for example, mucosal secretions and/or soft mucosal tissue during use of the nasal cannula. This is particularly true if the nasal cannula is used in a patient for an extended period of time, e.g., for a few hours to eight or more hours during a sleep diagnostic session. Over the course of time, the mucosal secretions and/or soft mucosal tissue, as well as any inhaled particulate matter which may collect within the nostrils, can either partially or completely occlude, block, clog or otherwise obstruct the primary inlet/outlet opening to one or both nares and such occlusion, blockage, or obstruction can then prevent that nare from properly achieving its intended function, e.g., prevent or seriously inhibit the nare from properly supplying the desired gas to the nostril of the patient, withdrawing or sampling the desired sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), or detecting changes in pressure within the nostril during patient breathing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a nasal cannula structure for sampling carbon dioxide which reduces or eliminates the incidence of occlusion of the tip of the carbon dioxide sampling nare during the removal of carbon dioxide by the sampling line connected to a monitoring device and/or a source of suction or vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a nasal cannula for insufflating a patient with oxygen while accurately monitoring end-tidal carbon dioxide, that will continue to function properly for its intended purpose when either or both nares become occluded for any reason.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object to accomplish the foregoing objects with a minimum risk of distorting the end-tidal carbon dioxide readings from the sampled exhalation gases during the administration of anesthesia.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Still another object of the present invention is to provide at least one, and preferably a pair of opposed openings, in a side wall of the nare, which form a secondary flow path into and out of the nare and insures proper function of the nare in the event that the primary flow path becomes either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed by, for example, mucosal secretions, soft mucosal tissue during use of the nasal cannula, any inhaled particulate matter which may collect within the nostrils, etc. That is, the secondary flow path insures that the nare is still able to function properly, e.g., supply a desired gas to the nostril of the patient or withdraw or sample a desired sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), or detect changes in pressure within the nostril during patient breathing, etc., in the event that the primary flow path becomes either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed for some reason.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide both of the nares with at least one, and preferably a pair of opposed openings, in a side walls thereof which form secondary flow paths for each nare and insures proper function of each nare in the event that the primary flow path of that nare becomes either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed by, for example, mucosal secretions, soft mucosal tissue during use of the nasal cannula, any inhaled particulate matter which may collect within the nostrils, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the present invention is to provide the nasal cannula with at least one mouthpiece, and possibly a pair of joined or completely separate mouthpieces, for communicating with a mouth of a patient so that the breathing characteristics (such as respiratory air waves and air flow) may be monitored during a sleep diagnostic session regardless of whether the patient solely breathes through his or her nose, the patient solely breathes through his or her mouth, or alternate breathing between his or her nose and mouth during the sleep diagnostic session. The mouthpiece has an internal fluid passageway which communicates, at one end thereof, with an inlet/outlet aperture or opening formed in end surface of the mouthpiece while an opposite end thereof communicates with an internal chamber or compartment of the nasal cannula.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The foregoing objects and advantages are obtained by providing a nasal cannula structure that is adapted for insufflation and sampling, with additional or secondary holes or vents on or in the nares of the nasal cannula, preferably both anterior and posterior of one or both nares at the location proximate the entrance of the nasal passageways when the cannula is in use for supplying the desired gas to the nostril of the patient or withdrawing or sampling a desired gas sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), or monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory airwaves and air flow), or detecting changes in pressure within the nostril during patient breathing, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention relates to a nasal cannula for coupling to flow/pressure detection equipment to facilitate collection of respiratory air waves and respiratory air flow of a patient, during a sleep diagnostic session, for inputting to conventional polysomnography equipment and subsequent analysis by sleep lab personnel. The collected data is useful in treating a patient for sleep apnea or a number of other different sleep disorders.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention also relates to a method of monitoring breathing of a patient with a nasal cannula, the method comprising the steps of: forming the nasal cannula with at least one nare, and the at least one nare having a primary inlet/outlet opening formed in a remote end thereof; coupling the nasal cannula to a detection device for monitoring breathing characteristics of the patient while the patient is sleeping; detecting breathing characteristics of the patient, while the patient is sleeping, via at least the primary inlet/outlet opening of the nare; and sending the detected breathing characteristics of the patient to detection device for evaluation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention also relates to A nasal cannula for monitoring breathing of a patient, the nasal cannula comprising an elongated hollow body for positioning adjacent a nose of the patient; a first nare having a fixed length, a remote free first end of the first nare having a primary inlet/outlet opening therein and being sized to be received within a first nasal passage of the nose, a second end of the first nare being connected to an internal compartment, and the first nare has at least one secondary inlet/outlet opening which communicates with the internal compartment; a second nare having a fixed length, a remote free first end of the second nare having a primary inlet/outlet opening therein and being sized to be received within a second nasal passage of the nose, a second end of the second nare being connected to an internal compartment, and the second nare has at least one secondary inlet/outlet opening which communicates with the internal compartment; and coupling the nasal cannula to a detection device for monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient while the patient is sleeping; detecting breathing characteristics of the patient, while the patient is sleeping, via at least the primary inlet/outlet opening of at least one of the first and second nares; and detecting the breathing characteristics of the patient, via at least the second inlet/outlet opening of at least one of the first and second nares, in the event that the primary inlet/outlet opening of one of the first and second nare becomes at least partially occluded.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The nasal cannula <b>10</b> of one embodiment of the present invention comprises or consists of a generally tubular face piece <b>12</b> having two spaced apart nares <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> and an internal septum <b>15</b> disposed in the center of the face piece <b>12</b> between the flow passage openings <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, respectively, of the nares <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>). The flow passage openings <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> on the ends of the face piece <b>12</b> are affixed to separate conduits or tubes <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which are separately connected to a source of insufflating gas (G), such as oxygen, and a commercial carbon dioxide monitoring unit (A) which, in turn, has or is connected to a vacuum pump or other means for drawing an exhaled breath, containing carbon dioxide, into an instrument that is capable of measuring the concentration of the carbon dioxide in the sampled gas.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">During use of the cannula for both insufflation and the monitoring of carbon dioxide concentration in the exhaled breath (depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the readings for end-tidal carbon dioxide can become distorted when there is undesirable mixing with room air or with excess insufflating gas. Likewise, carbon dioxide measuring devices which typically employ varying amounts of suction or vacuum to obtain the gas sample to be analyzed, can unduly dilute the sample or more seriously can draw the inlet/outlet opening <b>31</b>, located in the tip <b>30</b> of the sampling nare (representatively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), into contact with the adjacent surface of the tissue of the nasal passage and either partially or fully occlude the inlet/outlet opening <b>31</b> thereby restricting or even preventing sampling of the exhaled gases for their carbon dioxide concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This is an especially serious problem where the patient is prone to generate secretions and the secretions are present so as to be drawn into the inlet/outlet opening <b>31</b> at the tip <b>30</b> and then either partially or fully occlude, block, clog or otherwise obstruct the opening <b>31</b>, during the administration of anesthesia or a sleep diagnostic session, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The anesthesiologist must respond by clearing the nare opening after first removing the cannula from its initially installed location on the face of the patient. This may be complicated especially where the patient is draped in a manner which covers the cannula, such as in eye surgery. It may also be difficult to detect the occlusion where the end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement signal is only partially, but not fully, degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It has been discovered that the expedient of additionally providing the nares with very small holes or openings, shown collectively at <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> adjacent the tip <b>30</b>, achieves the desired result of preventing an undesirable and unnecessary level of suction at the opening <b>31</b> of the tip <b>30</b> from developing sufficiently to draw the opening <b>31</b> into the nasal tissue thereby either partially or fully occluding, blocking, clogging or otherwise obstructing the opening <b>31</b>. The holes are sized large enough to prevent sufficient suction from developing at the tip <b>30</b> so as to draw in mucosal secretions or attach the tip by suction to the soft mucosal tissue, while still facilitating drawing an undiluted sample of the exhaled gases to provide good end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements. Likewise, too large an opening for these holes would undesirably dilute the exhaled gas sample with room air or excess insufflation gas.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The openings <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> and/or <b>38</b> also facilitate obtaining or withdrawing a desired sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), or detect changes in pressure within the nostril during patient breathing, etc., by providing a secondary flow path in the event that the primary flow path becomes either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed during use of the cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As previously noted, the nasal cannula of the present invention can be used in combination with an oxygen delivery system that delivers the insufflating gas intermittently. The delivery can be initiated at any time after the peak end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement is achieved during exhalation and continuing into the inhalation phase of the breathing cycle or could be inhalation activated or designed to deliver only during selected portions of all or only some of the inhalation phases of a patient's breathing cycles. Preferably, the delivery should begin before the termination of the exhalation phase, such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,131. Using intermittent delivery substantially reduces the possibility of distorted carbon dioxide readings due to gas mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Likewise, slits or slots (not shown) may be employed in the nares which could function in the same manner as the holes describe if they are positioned in such a manner to avoid collapse or occlusion with the nasal tissues and provide the desired function of preventing sufficient suction from developing at the tip of the nare to cause it to be drawn, by suction, onto the tissues. The holes provided as described herein are preferred as there is less risk of occlusion and trauma from the edges of slits or slots to the nasal tissue and potentially there is less risk of occlusion and trauma from the edges of slits or slots to the nasal tissue and potentially there is less risk of gas dilution and mixing from occurring where the slits or slots are overly large.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, the combination of intermittent insufflation using the cannula of the present invention produces the desired end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement, as described, and helps prevent patient desaturation during the rigors of surgery and anesthesia administration.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, the size of the openings from between about 0.05 to about 0.07 of an inch or so though larger or smaller holes or a single hole may be advantageously employed in combination with specific analytical apparatuses. The size and location of the openings can vary with the analyzer selected and the proper function confirmed without undue experimentation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is to be appreciated that as discussed above, the cannula may have only a single hollow nasal prong or nare, a pair of nasal prongs or nares and the cannula can be divided or undivided. In addition, the spacing from the nare will vary depending upon whether the cannula is used for neonatal, pediatric or an adult. In addition, the spacing of the mouthpieces, if more than one mouthpiece is utilized, can vary from application from application. The important aspect of the present invention is that the secondary inlet/outlet openings are provided in the nare to allow the nare to function even if the primary inlet/outlet becomes substantially blocked, clogged, obstructed or occluded for one reason or another. The secondary holes allow the nare to still operate and preform the intended function. That is, the secondary inlet/outlet opening(s) still allow the nare to supply a treating gas to the nostril of the patient, allow sampling or withdrawal of an exit gas being exhausted by the nostril of the patient (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), allow monitoring or detection of the breathing characteristic via the nare, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The inventors of the present invention have found that the secondary inlet/outlet opening(s), provided in at least one of the nares, is very useful in monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (e.g., detecting changes in pressure during breathing), to sleep lab personnel, in the event that one or both of the primary inlet/outlet openings of the nares becomes either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed by, for example, mucosal secretions, soft mucosal tissue during use of the nasal cannula, any inhaled particulate matter which may collect within the nostrils, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The inventors have determined that the primary inlet/outlet opening in combination with the secondary inlet/outlet opening(s) ensure the ability of the nare to adequately detect or sense the change in pressure within the nasal cavity of the patient, wearing the nasal cannula, as the patient breathes while he or she is sleeping and being monitored. In addition, the secondary inlet/outlet opening is still able to adequately detect or sense the change in pressure within the nasal cavity of the patient, wearing the nasal cannula, as the patient breathes while he or she is sleeping and being monitored. That is, the secondary inlet/outlet opening is still able to detect changes in pressure, e.g., from negative to positive and vice versa, as the patient discontinues inhalation (negative pressure) and commences exhalation (positive pressure), and vice versa, withdraw or sample a desired gas sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), etc. As a result of this, the sleep diagnostic equipment is still able to continue monitoring the breathing characteristics of the patient, while the patient remains sleeping.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If the nasal cannula were unable to continue to monitor breathing characteristics of the patient, detect pressure, sample a desired gas, etc., the sleep lab technician will generally alter or manipulate the position of the nasal cannula in an attempt to remove or alleviate the occlusion, blockage, clog or obstruction, while the patient is still sleeping, without waking or arousing the patient. In some instances, the sleep lab technician may have to completely remove the nasal cannula, clear the occlusion, blockage, clog or obstruction, and then reinstall the nasal cannula while the patient is still sleeping, without waking the patient. However, if the patient wakes up during such manipulation or removal by the sleep lab technician, this will delay somewhat the sleep lab test or may possibly cause the sleep lab technician to restart patient testing and this can be costly and time consuming. It is to be appreciated that without the additional secondary inlet/outlet opening, provided in a side wall of the nare, in many instances the patient may be sufficiently aroused or awakened, as the sleep lab technician attempts to manipulate or remove the cannula to remove or alleviate the occlusion, blockage, clog or obstruction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, another embodiment of the cannula will now be discussed. As this embodiment is very similar to the previous embodiment, identical reference numerals will given to identical elements and only the differences between this embodiment and the previous embodiment will be discussed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The only significant difference between this embodiment and the previous embodiment is the addition of a curved mouthpiece which is connected to the main body of the cannula for monitoring the breathing characteristics of a patient, obtaining a desired sample, detecting pressure, for example, for a mouth breathing patient. That is, the nasal cannula <b>60</b> comprises a single flow path having three separate inlet/outlet openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>83</b> to the central internal chamber or compartment C defined by the main body. Each one of the three inlet/outlet openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>83</b> to the central internal chamber or compartment C is suitable for monitoring breathing characteristics, detecting pressure, withdrawing or sampling an exhalation gas(es) from the patient nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), measuring differential air flow along the tubing connect to the cannula, supplying a treating gas to a patient, etc., both via either a nostril or the mouth of a patient. The central chamber or compartment C of the main body <b>71</b> of the cannula <b>60</b> is in constant and continuous communication with an inlet/outlet opening <b>83</b>, formed in the end surface of the mouthpiece <b>69</b>, via a gas passageway <b>77</b> in the mouthpiece <b>69</b> and also in constant and continuous communication with the inlet/outlet opening <b>62</b>, formed in the end surface of the first nare <b>65</b>, and the secondary inlet/outlet opening(s) <b>35</b> and/or <b>36</b> via a gas passageway <b>91</b> in the first nare <b>65</b> and in constant and continuous communication with the inlet/outlet opening <b>64</b>, formed in the end surface of the second nare <b>67</b>, and the secondary inlet/outlet opening(s) <b>37</b> and/or <b>38</b> via a gas passageway <b>95</b> in the second nare <b>67</b>. In addition, the central chamber or compartment C of the main body <b>71</b> also communicates with first and second opposed chamber end openings <b>73</b>, <b>75</b> of the cannula <b>60</b>. As a result of this arrangement, each one of these inlet/outlet openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>83</b> can facilitate preforming one of the following functions: monitor breathing of a patient via the mouth and/or the nose, sampling the end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>content in the exhaled breath of a patient via the mouth and/or the nose to determine the patient's CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration level in the blood, measuring differential air flow along the tubing connect to the cannula, supplying a treating gas to a patient via the mouth and/or the nose, detecting changes in pressure air flow, or detecting apnea via the mouth and/or the nose, etc.</p>

The opposite end of the common conduit or tubing <b>80</b> typically has a luer connector <b>82</b> which is either coupled to a filter <b>84</b>, prior to engaging with a pressure detection device or detection equipment <b>86</b> or, preferably, the filter <b>84</b> may be incorporated into the conventional luer connector <b>82</b> and this unitary structure will then facilitate coupling of the nasal cannula <b>60</b> to the pressure detection device or detection equipment <b>86</b> in a conventional fashion. The first and second conduits or tubings <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> each have a length of about 8 inches to about a 24 inches or so and preferably have a length of about 15 to 25 inches or so while the common conduit or tubing <b>80</b> typically has a length of about 3 feet to about 10 feet, preferably a length of about 5 to 7 feet or so.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The only significant differences between this embodiment and the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is the inclusion of a second integral mouthpiece <b>69</b>&#x2032; and the addition of an internal divider or septum <b>81</b>, within the internal chamber or compartment C, which divides the internal area of the cannula into two separate chambers or compartments C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. That is, the nasal cannula <b>60</b> comprises two completely separate internal flow paths <b>96</b> and <b>98</b>. Each one of the two completely separate internal flow paths <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> is suitable for monitoring breathing characteristics, detecting pressure, withdrawing or sampling an exhalation gas(es) from the patient nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), measuring differential air flow along the tubing connect to the cannula, supplying a treating gas to a patient, etc., both via a nostril and the mouth of a patient. The first compartment or passageway C<b>1</b>, of the internal chamber C of the main body <b>71</b> of the cannula <b>60</b>, is in constant and continuous communication with an inlet/outlet opening <b>83</b>, formed in the end surface of the first mouthpiece <b>69</b>, via a gas passageway <b>77</b> in the first mouthpiece <b>69</b> and also in constant and continuous communication with the inlet/outlet opening <b>62</b>, formed in the end surface of the first nare <b>65</b>, via a gas passageway <b>91</b> in the first nare <b>65</b> and with the first chamber end opening <b>73</b> of the cannula and all of these components and passageways form the first completely separate internal flow path <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The second compartment or passageway C<b>2</b>, of the internal chamber C of the main body <b>71</b> of the cannula <b>60</b>, is in constant and continuous communication with the inlet/outlet opening <b>87</b>, formed in the end surface of the second mouthpiece <b>69</b>&#x2032;, via a gas passageway <b>79</b> in the second mouthpiece <b>69</b>&#x2032; and also in constant and continuous communication with the inlet/outlet opening <b>64</b>, formed in the end surface of the second nare <b>67</b>, via a gas passageway <b>95</b> in the second nare <b>67</b> and with the second chamber end opening <b>75</b> of the cannula <b>60</b> and all of these components and passageways form the second completely separate internal flow path <b>98</b>. As a result of these completely separate fluid passageways <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, each completely separate fluid passageway <b>96</b> or <b>98</b> can facilitate preforming one of the following functions: monitor breathing of a patient via the mouth and/or the nose, sampling the end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>content in the exhaled breath of a patient via the mouth and/or the nose to determine the patient's CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration level in the blood, measuring differential air flow along the tubing connected to the cannula, supplying a treating gas to a patient via the mouth and/or the nose, detecting apnea via the mouth and/or the nose, etc. If desired, the septum <b>81</b> may be eliminated (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) so that the first and second compartments or passageways C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, the first and second internal gas passageways <b>77</b>, <b>79</b> and the first and second gas passageways <b>91</b> and <b>95</b> in the nares <b>65</b> and <b>67</b> and all of the openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>75</b>, <b>83</b> and <b>87</b>, are in constant and continuous communication with one another.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The only significant difference between this embodiment and the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is the inclusion of at least one, and preferably a pair of secondary inlets/outlets openings <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, adjacent the tip of each one of the nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b> to provide a pair of secondary flow passages <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> in the event that the primary inlets/outlets openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> of the nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b>, respectively, become either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed during use of the nasal cannula <b>60</b>. The secondary inlets/outlets openings <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, <b>38</b> are smaller than the primary inlet/outlet openings <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> but are large enough to facilitate withdrawing or sampling a desired gas sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling of end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory airwaves and air flow), detecting changes in pressure within the nostril, etc., during patient breathing.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, yet another embodiment of the cannula will now be discussed. As this embodiment is very similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, identical reference numerals are given to identical elements and only the differences between this embodiment and the previous embodiment will be discussed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The only significant difference between this embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is that the septum <b>81</b> is eliminated so that the first and second compartments or passageways C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, the first and second internal gas passageways <b>77</b>, <b>79</b> and the first and second gas passageways <b>91</b> and <b>95</b> in the nares <b>65</b> and <b>67</b> and all of the openings <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>75</b>, <b>83</b> and <b>87</b> are in constant and continuous communication with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With respect to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>, it is to be appreciated that it is not necessary to have the first and second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; precisely centered between the nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b>. It is possible to position the first and second mouthpieces on one side or the other of a central plane P bisecting a center of main body <b>71</b> into two halves. Alternatively, the first and second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; could be spaced apart from one another and formed as two completely separate and curved mouthpieces (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-15</figref>) with a septum <b>81</b> dividing the internal chamber or compartment into two separate internal flow paths <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 14</figref>). Each one of the two completely separate internal flow paths <b>96</b> and <b>98</b> is suitable for monitoring breathing characteristics, detecting pressure, withdrawing or sampling an exhalation gas(es) from the patient nostril (e.g., sampling end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaled gases of a patient), supplying a desired gas to the patient, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition, the first and second mouthpieces could be spaced apart from one another, without having a dividing septum <b>81</b> therebetween (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), so that both of the nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b> and both of the first and second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; all communicate with one another via the common central chamber or compartment formed within the main body <b>71</b> of the cannula <b>60</b>. The spacing of the mouthpieces from one another by a distance of from about 0.25 to about 1.25 inches, and more preferably about 0.5 to about 1.0 inches, is useful if the patient being monitored tends to breath, when mouth breathing, out of one side of his or her mouth. By spacing the mouthpieces from one another, mouthpieces of the nasal cannula are better positioned to still detect or monitor breathing of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition, the first and second nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> may be each provided with at least one, and preferably a pair of secondary inlets/outlets openings, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, adjacent the tip <b>30</b> of the nares to provide a pair of secondary flow passages <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, respectively) in the event that the primary inlets/outlets openings <b>31</b> of the nares <b>65</b>, <b>67</b> become either partially or fully occluded, blocked, clogged or otherwise obstructed during use of the nasal cannula. The secondary inlets/outlets openings, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, <b>38</b> are smaller than the primary inlet/outlet opening but are large enough to facilitate withdrawing or sampling a desired gas sample from the nostril (e.g., sampling of end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>in a patient), monitoring breathing characteristics of a patient (such as respiratory air waves and air flow), detecting changes in pressure within the nostril, etc., during patient breathing.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">If desired, one or both of the mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; of the cannula <b>60</b> can be provided with a shape retaining, dead soft material or wire (not shown) to facilitate alignment and retention of the first and/or second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; in a desired aligned position during use of the cannula <b>60</b>. The wire permits the mouthpiece <b>69</b> or <b>69</b>&#x2032; to be bent, configured or molded into a desired shape, configuration or position while still retaining such desired shape, configuration or position following adjustment of the mouthpiece <b>69</b> and/or <b>69</b>&#x2032;. A copper wire (either insulated or uninsulated), for example, has substantially no structural memory of any previous shape, orientation, configuration or form which would cause the wire to retain, return or spring back to such previous shape, orientation, configuration or form. Copper is a highly malleable metal and generally retains whatever shape is imparted thereto at any particular time without reverting or returning back to any prior or previous shape. Copper is also a preferred dead soft material, over for example iron, steel or other ferromagnetic materials, due to the propensity of the nasal cannula to be used in connection with a patient exposed to certain electromagnetic and magnetic environments and/or diagnosis procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The wire can either be formed integral with the first and/or second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032;, can be accommodated within an integral compartment extending along the length of the first and/or second mouthpieces <b>69</b> and/or <b>69</b>&#x2032;, or can be glued or otherwise permanently secured or affixed to an exterior surface of the first and/or second mouthpieces <b>69</b> and/or <b>69</b>&#x2032;, along the entire length thereof, so that the wire does not become separated or dislodged from the cannula during use of the nasal cannula. The wire typically has a diameter of between 0.01 and 0.2 inches or so.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first and second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; each have a radius of curvature of between about 0.5 of an inch to about 2.5 inches or so, and more preferably a radius of curvature of between about 0.75 of an inch to about 1.25 inches or so. The radius of curvature of the mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; can vary, depending upon the cannula being manufactured and/or its application, but is generally chosen to facilitate the alignment of an opening formed in the free end of the mouthpiece <b>69</b> and/or <b>69</b>&#x2032; with the opening of a mouth of the patient. The first and second mouthpieces <b>69</b>, <b>69</b>&#x2032; each define an internal passageway <b>77</b>, <b>79</b> therein which has a transverse cross sectional flow area of between about 0.006 and about 0.007 square inches.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Since certain changes may be made in the above described improved cannula and method of using the same, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention herein involved, it is intended that all of the subject matter of the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted merely as examples illustrating the inventive concept herein and shall not be construed as limiting the invention.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention generally relates to passenger conveyors. More particularly, this invention relates to making a handrail for a passenger conveyor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Passenger conveyors are well known. A plurality of steps typically follow a loop for carrying individuals between landings at opposite ends of the conveyor. A handrail is often provided so that passengers can stabilize themselves as they travel along on the conveyor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical handrail design has a flat surface that faces upward with rounded edges. The body of the handrail is often made from laminated sheets of material using adhesives, heat or pressure to secure the layers together. Some rubber handrails have been made using a molding process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One disadvantage to conventional handrail designs is that they do not provide an easily-gripped surface for a wide variety of passengers. A more ergonomically friendly design is desirable. Conventional manufacturing techniques, however, place limitations upon the shape of a handrail because of material cost and the bending stiffness required for a workable handrail.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another shortcoming of conventional handrail designs is that they typically rely upon a pinching drive arrangement that utilizes friction between a handrail and a drive mechanism that creates a normal force against the handrail sufficient for causing the handrail to move with the steps of the passenger conveyor. Such arrangements often cause marking and scuffing on the outer surface of the handrail. This leads to premature replacement of a handrail.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An alternative drive arrangement is shown in Japanese Patent No. 2735453. In that document, rack teeth are formed on a handrail inner surface to cooperate with a drive mechanism for moving the handrail. While that document shows an improved driving arrangement for a handrail, the overall handrail design and method of manufacture are not ideal. Those skilled in the art are always striving to make improvements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention provides an improved handrail design and manufacturing technique that allows for implementing non-conventional handrail shapes and an improved driving arrangement.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An example method of making a handrail for a passenger conveyor includes co-extruding a plurality of polymer materials to establish a passenger gripping surface from a first polymer material and an inner portion from a second polymer material. One example includes forming a toothed driving surface on the handrail. The toothed surface provides a drive surface for interacting with a drive mechanism that has a corresponding surface configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One example handrail includes a plurality of co-extruded polymer materials. A first one of the polymer materials has properties that establish a gripping surface and a second one of the polymer materials has properties that establish high wear resistance, for example, in an inner portion. The handrail in one example includes a toothed driving surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The various features and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of a currently preferred embodiment. The drawings that accompany the detailed description can be briefly described as follows.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a passenger conveyor <b>20</b> that includes a plurality of steps <b>22</b> that move in a known manner for carrying passengers between landings <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. A handrail assembly <b>30</b> is associated with the plurality of steps <b>22</b> to allows passengers to brace themselves while riding on the conveyor <b>20</b>. The handrail assembly <b>30</b> includes a handrail and a balustrade <b>34</b>. A handrail guidance (not shown) facilitates the handrail <b>32</b> moving relative to the balustrade <b>34</b> to move in unison with the steps <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows, in cross-section, one example handrail <b>32</b> designed according to an embodiment of this invention. In this example, the handrail <b>32</b> comprises a plurality of polymer materials. In this example, a first polymer material <b>34</b> and a second polymer material <b>36</b> are shown. More than two materials may be used to meet the needs of a particular situation. Two materials are illustrated for discussion purposes. Those skilled in the art who have the benefit of this description will be able to select appropriate materials and combinations of them to meet the needs of their particular situation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first polymer material <b>34</b> in one example comprises a thermoplastic polyurethane. In this example, the first polymer material <b>34</b> forms a relatively hard outer surface <b>38</b> that provides a passenger gripping surface.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second polymer material <b>36</b> establishes an inner portion of the handrail <b>32</b>. Using a second material <b>36</b> allows for using a less expensive material on the inside of the handrail, for example. The outer layer or gripping surface <b>38</b> must have a certain durability on the surface, for example. The inner portion made of the second polymer material <b>36</b> need not have such a characteristic but should have reasonable wear resistance characteristics and cost-savings may be achieved by appropriately selecting one or more second polymer materials <b>36</b> to form the inner portion of the handrail <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one example, the second material <b>36</b> has a stiffness corresponding to a strength in the range from about 40 to about 50 mega pascal. In one example, the material has a shore hardness in a range from about 80 to about 90. Given this description, those skilled in the art will be able to select an appropriate material to meet their particular needs.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Given the cross-section of the illustrated example, it is expected that relatively more raw material will be required for making the handrail <b>32</b> compared to conventional, more flattened-out designs. Using a plurality of materials allows for avoiding increased costs otherwise associated with a circular cross-section compared to the flattened-out designs of the past. In this example, there is some spacing that is not filled between the first polymer material <b>34</b> and the second polymer material <b>36</b>. This spacing is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> at <b>39</b>. Other examples may include a third polymer material filling that spacing. Such a third polymer material can be selected from even less expensive materials as it does not have any outside surface requirements associated with performance of the handrail. One advantage of the illustrated example is that material selections can be made that provide cost savings compared to conventional designs.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, selecting various polymer materials allows for controlling the stiffness and bending characteristics of the handrail so that a desired durability and surface texture can be achieved within given cost constraints. Those skilled in the art who have the benefit of this description will realize what material combinations will work best for their particular situation. Commercially available or custom designed materials may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">One feature of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is that a toothed driving surface <b>40</b> is provided on an &#x201c;inner&#x201d; side of the handrail <b>32</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show example toothed driving surfaces <b>40</b>. In each example, recessed portions <b>42</b> are interdigitated with teeth <b>44</b> that provide a drive surface to be engaged by a toothed sprocket or a toothed belt, for example. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the teeth <b>44</b> do not project outward beyond a finished inner surface on the handrail. In that example, the recesses <b>42</b> do not extend across the entire length of the drive surface <b>40</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the recesses <b>42</b> are like grooves across the entire width of the drive surface <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the illustrated example includes a low-friction material slider layer <b>46</b> that facilitates the handrail <b>32</b> moving along a guidance. In one example, the slider layer material is adhered to the second polymer material <b>36</b> after that is extruded and while the material is still warm enough to readily achieve a sufficient bond between the slider layer material and the second polymer <b>36</b>. In another example, the slider layer is fed through the extrusion machinery and adheres to the material during the extrusion process. In one example, the low friction slider layer comprises a known material used for conveyor handrail slider layers.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically illustrates one example technique for forming the handrail <b>32</b> and establishing a toothed driving surface <b>40</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, molding machinery <b>50</b> includes a first extruder <b>52</b> that extrudes a first one of the polymer materials <b>34</b>, which is fed into the machinery <b>50</b> at <b>54</b>. A second extruder <b>56</b> extrudes a second polymer material <b>36</b>, which is fed in at <b>58</b>. The outputs from the extruders <b>52</b> and <b>56</b> are provided to a common molding device <b>60</b>. In this example, the molding device <b>60</b> has a plurality of manifolds <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> as inputs for receiving the extruded materials <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. A single output <b>66</b> is shaped or includes a die to establish the configuration of the handrail <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The illustrated example uses co-extrusion of a plurality of polymer materials for forming the handrail. Co-extrusion techniques are known and those skilled in the art who have the benefit of this description will be able to select appropriate materials and techniques for achieving a handrail configuration to meet the needs of their particular situation. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> incorporates the use of the laminar flow principle that enables the two molten layers of material <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> under proper operating conditions to join them in the common flow channel of the mold <b>60</b> with minimum intermixing of the materials at the contacting interface between them. This provides the multi-portion handrail design (i.e., an inner portion and an outer portion) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this example, two chambers following the manifold inlets <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> each include a width, length and height with a required cross-section to establish the corresponding portions of the handrail. The resulting product <b>32</b>&#x2032; is stretched in the air and then passed through an arrangement for finishing the handrail. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a first wheel <b>70</b> engages the driving surface <b>40</b> on the &#x201c;inner&#x201d; side to establish the toothed driving surface <b>40</b>. In one example, the wheel <b>70</b> has a serrated exterior that induces the teeth on the driving surface <b>40</b> by cutting or pressing the extruded handrail material to form the recesses <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a gripping surface finishing wheel <b>72</b> engages the gripping surface <b>38</b> and establishes a desired texture for the gripping surface. At the end of the process, a cooling bath <b>74</b> cools the materials of the handrail <b>32</b> so that it can be handled in a known manner for packaging and shipping to a job site.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another example, the toothed driving surface <b>40</b> is established during the co-extrusion process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a load bearing member <b>80</b> is provided within the handrail <b>32</b>. In this example, a plurality of steel cords are supported at least partially within the second polymer material <b>36</b> to provide the load bearing member <b>80</b>. In one example, the toothed driving surface <b>40</b> is established in connection with providing the load bearing member <b>80</b> within the handrail <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically shows a mold wheel <b>82</b> that is included as part of the extrusion machinery in one example and has a plurality of projections <b>84</b> and recesses <b>86</b>. The steel cords of the load bearing member <b>80</b> are supported along the projections <b>84</b> in the extrusion machinery so that the appropriate polymer material at least partially encases the load bearing member <b>80</b> and fills the recesses <b>86</b> on the mold wheel <b>82</b>. As the extruded material and the load bearing member <b>80</b> leave the mold wheel <b>82</b> the material already has a driving surface similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In such an arrangement, the wheel <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be a guiding wheel without a serrated exterior surface to guide the handrail <b>32</b> toward the cooling bath <b>74</b>. The wheel <b>72</b> in such an example may be textured to provide a desired texture on the gripping surface on the handrail <b>32</b>. One example includes a control system for adjusting a required forming pressure on the driving surface <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The preceding description is exemplary rather than limiting in nature. Variations and modifications to the disclosed examples may become apparent to those skilled in the art that do not necessarily depart from the essence of this invention. The scope of legal protection given to this invention can only be determined by studying the following claims.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to a textile separating apparatus, and more specifically, to a textile separating apparatus for the separation of individual textile items from a pile of textile items, thereby aiding in inspection, sorting, and/or assembly of the textiles into groups or packages.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, management of textiles requires separation of individual textile items from a pile or heap of textile items so that each textile item may be inspected, counted, and/or distributed into appropriate groups or packages. Each package or group may be desired to have a predetermined number and/or quality of textile items. The current methods used to separate textile items, such as selection and inspection by hand, are operator dependant, thus rates of production are widely variable, and require constant repetitive motions by the operator to process the textile items. Additionally, more than one operator is often needed. Typically, separation and distribution of the textile items by hand is an accurate, but time consuming and labor intensive process that requires each individual textile item, from a pile of textile items of undetermined number and quality, be manually selected and separated from the pile for inspection and counting.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the existing methods of manual separation of textile items for inspection, counting, and/or packaging, the present disclosure provides a new strategy in textile separation. Namely, the present disclosure describes a textile separating apparatus for the successive selection of a number of individual textile items from a pile of textile items, thereby aiding in inspection, sorting, and/or packaging in groups of a predetermined number and/or quality.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present textile separating apparatus, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, employs a new technology in regards to the textile industry. Some embodiments of a textile separating apparatus may generally include a textile collection area for supporting a pile of textile items, and a textile receiving area. A transport mechanism having an inclined face may span the distance between the textile collection area and the textile receiving area, and may further intersect the pile of textile items. A pick member projecting from the face of the transport mechanism may separate and carry a textile item towards the textile receiving area.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some embodiments of a textile separating apparatus may include a looped transport mechanism intersecting a pile of textile items supported by the textile collection area. Further, in some embodiments, a pick member projecting from the transport mechanism may move in a continuous circuit to successively separate, and carry away individual textile items to a textile receiving area.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the textile collection area may further include an advancement mechanism for the movement of textile items towards the transport mechanism at a controlled rate. The rate may be adjustable to insure that the rate of travel is timed to supply an appropriate quantity of textile items to the transport mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The textile receiving area may further include mechanism for further processing the separated textile items, such as an inspection station moving at a controlled rate away from the transport mechanism, a photoelectric eye to count textile items, a gate programmed to alternatively allow or impede the progression of the textile items, and/or an automated bagging system.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As described herein, a textile separating apparatus <b>10</b> may be configured in accordance with the present disclosure to separate, and carry away, individual textile items from a pile of textile items. The separated textile items may then be further processed as desired into packages of textiles of a predetermined number, and/or quality. For example, the separated textile items may be inspected for quality purposes, counted, and/or bagged. For clarity, textile separating apparatus <b>10</b> is illustrated without textile items in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, and with textile items in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, textile separating apparatus <b>10</b> may include a textile collection area <b>12</b> supporting plural textile items such as those shown in pile P, and a powered transport mechanism <b>14</b> intersecting the pile of textile items P. In accordance with the present disclosure, a pick member <b>16</b>, projecting from a face <b>34</b> of transport mechanism <b>14</b>, may separate and carry away a textile item up an incline from the pile of textile items P towards a textile receiving area <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, textile separating apparatus <b>10</b> may further include mechanism for processing of separated textile items at textile receiving area <b>18</b>. For example, textile receiving area <b>18</b> may include an inspection station <b>38</b> to receive and convey the separated textile items from transport mechanism <b>14</b>, and/or an automated bagging system <b>20</b> for packaging the separated textile items.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Textile collection area <b>12</b> may include structure to contain the pile of textile items P. In some examples of textile separating apparatus <b>10</b>, textile collection area <b>12</b> may include a bin <b>22</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, bin <b>22</b> may include side walls <b>24</b>, a rear wall <b>26</b> distal with respect to transport mechanism <b>14</b>, and a front wall <b>28</b> adjacent transport mechanism <b>14</b>. Bin <b>22</b> may be characterized by angles and dimensions suitable for containing the pile of textile items P, and, further, may be shaped and/or configured to direct the pile of textiles items P towards transport mechanism <b>14</b>. For example, part or all of side walls <b>24</b> may be inwardly sloping towards the bottom of bin <b>22</b>. Further, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, front wall <b>28</b> may be angled towards transport mechanism <b>14</b> to aid in intersection of transport mechanism <b>14</b> with the pile of textiles P. The size and shape of bin <b>22</b> may further depend on the size and shape of the pile of textile items P to be separated.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, textile collection area <b>14</b> may include a powered advancement mechanism <b>30</b> to direct, compel, advance, or otherwise move the pile of textile items P towards transport mechanism <b>14</b>, such that transport mechanism <b>14</b> may continuously intersect with the pile of textile items P. Examples of advancement mechanism <b>30</b> may include a belt conveyor, a pushing device, a lifting device, a vibration device and/or other known movement means.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Textile collection area <b>12</b> may include an advancement mechanism <b>30</b> to move the supported pile of textile items P towards transport mechanism <b>14</b>, as illustrated by directional arrow D<b>1</b>. Advancement mechanism <b>30</b> may span all, or part of, the length of textile collection area <b>12</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, advancement mechanism <b>30</b> may include raised members <b>32</b> for increased frictional movement of the pile of textile items P towards transport mechanism <b>14</b>. A plurality of textile items of undetermined quantity and/or quality may thereby enter textile collection area <b>12</b> for continuous movement by advancement mechanism <b>30</b> towards transport mechanism <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As discussed above, transport mechanism <b>14</b>, in accordance with the present disclosure, may define an inclined face <b>34</b> that intersects the pile of textile items P. For example, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, textile collection area <b>12</b> may lie generally in the plane of the floor, whereas transport mechanism <b>14</b> may operate at an incline of 100-120 degrees relative to textile collection area <b>12</b>. Transport mechanism <b>14</b> thus may be inclined such that a separated textile item may be partially supported by transport mechanism <b>14</b> as it travels away from the pile of textile items P, as illustrated by directional arrow D<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Transport mechanism <b>14</b> may extend between textile collection area <b>12</b> and textile receiving area <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, transport mechanism <b>14</b> may span the entire distance between textile collection area <b>12</b> and textile receiving area <b>18</b>, thereby providing for delivery of individual textile items from textile collection area <b>12</b> to textile receiving area <b>18</b>. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, one or more guidewalls <b>36</b> may line the sides of transport mechanism <b>14</b> to ensure that separated textile items do not fall off the sides of transport mechanism <b>14</b>. Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it will be appreciated that transport mechanism <b>14</b> may form a loop, such that pick member <b>16</b> travels in a continuous circuit that intersects with the pile of textile items P to catch hold of a textile item from the pile of textile items P, deliver the textile item up an incline and over a precipice to textile receiving area <b>18</b>, and then return to textile collection area <b>12</b> to catch hold of another textile item.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, pick member <b>16</b> may project from face <b>34</b> of transport mechanism <b>14</b>. In some examples, pick member <b>16</b> may be approximately &#xbd;-inch long, and may project from face <b>34</b> at an approximate 110-degree upward angle. In other words, pick member <b>16</b> may project from face <b>34</b> at an approximate 70 degree acute angle <b>17</b> with respect to face <b>34</b>. In other examples, pick member <b>16</b> may take the form of a metal hook. In still other examples, pick member <b>16</b> may take another shape adapted to catch, hold, and pull a textile item from a pile, and may be angled depending on the type of textile item to be separated. The size of pick member <b>16</b> may also depend on the size and/or weight of the textile item to be separated.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, one or more pick members <b>16</b> may project from transport mechanism <b>14</b>, and may be uniformly or variably spaced along the length or a partial length of transport mechanism <b>14</b>. For example, one of more pick members <b>16</b> may be spaced from 3-inches to 24-inches apart along a length of transport mechanism <b>14</b>. In the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, one or more pick members <b>16</b> are mounted adjacent opposite side edges of face <b>34</b> of transport mechanism <b>14</b> in an alternating pattern. The alternating pattern may allow a greater number of pick members <b>16</b> to project from transport mechanism <b>14</b>. The locations of pick members <b>16</b> also may depend on the size of the items selected.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, it may be possible to move the pick members along a stationary surface, thereby providing for movement of textile items along the incline. In these embodiments, pick member <b>16</b> may project openings in the stationary surface. In other embodiments, pick member <b>16</b> may be coupled or mounted to face <b>34</b> such that pick member <b>16</b> moves with face <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As explained above, in some examples it may be desirable to further process textile items after textile items have been separated, and carried away from the pile of textile items P. Further processing may include processing within textile receiving area <b>18</b>, located in a textile receiving relationship with respect to transport mechanism <b>14</b>. As best shown in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, transport mechanism <b>14</b> may project over textile receiving area <b>18</b>. In some examples, a textile item separated by pick member <b>16</b> may travel over a precipice of transport mechanism <b>14</b>, and may drop onto textile receiving area <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Textile receiving area <b>18</b> may include an inspection station employing a powered conveyer <b>38</b> for conveyance of separated textile pieces away from transport mechanism <b>14</b>, as illustrated by directional arrow D<b>3</b>. The rate of conveyance through the inspection station may depend on the time needed for inspection, sorting, and/or collection of the textile items. A human operator may inspect the separated textile items or, alternatively, textile receiving area <b>18</b> may include an optical inspection machine or scanner. Alternative examples of textile receiving area <b>18</b> may include other known mechanisms for spaced movement of textile items. Textile receiving area <b>18</b> may further include a gate <b>40</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to selectively impede movement of the textile items.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, in some examples, textile separating apparatus <b>10</b> may include automated bagging system <b>20</b> to provide automatic bagging and sealing of the separated textile items. For example, textile separating apparatus <b>10</b> may include a Max&#x2122; Bagging Machine, manufactured by Sharp Packaging Systems of Sussex, Wis. Other exemplary automated bagging systems include the Titan 6500 Semi-automatic Packaging Machine manufactured by James Dawson Enterprises, Ltd. of Plattsburg, N.Y.; the T1000 Advance Poly-Bagger manufactured by Advanced Poly Packaging of Akron, Ohio; or the Autobagger manufactured by Automated Packaging Systems of Streetsboro, Ohio. Each of these systems is capable of bagging and sealing up to 60 bags per minute. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, automated bagging system <b>20</b> may include an exit conveyer <b>46</b> for conveying filled bags away from the area surrounding automated bagging system <b>20</b>, as illustrated by directional arrow D<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Inspection station <b>38</b> may further include a photoelectric eye <b>42</b>. Photoelectric eye <b>42</b> may count the textile items at inspection station <b>38</b>, for example, as they pass on a belt conveyor. Photoelectric eye <b>42</b> may be mounted approximately 10-inches from the distal end of inspection station <b>38</b>. Photoelectric eye <b>42</b> may be protected by a photoelectric eye cover <b>44</b>. In some examples of textile separating apparatus <b>10</b>, photoelectric eye <b>42</b> may be operationally interconnected with gate <b>40</b> and/or automated bagging system <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An exemplary method of separating textiles in accordance with the present disclosure and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> may proceed as follows. A number of textile items may be loaded in to textile collection area <b>12</b>, all at once, or in intermittent loads. Advancement mechanism <b>30</b> may advance the resulting pile of textile items P towards transport mechanism <b>14</b>, so that the pile of textile items P and transport mechanism <b>14</b> intersect. Pick member <b>16</b>, projecting from face <b>34</b> of transport mechanism <b>14</b>, may separate individual textile items from the pile of textile items P, and carry the separated textile items towards textile receiving area <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Once separated, textile items may be released or dropped into textile receiving area <b>18</b>. Pick member <b>16</b> may then return in a continuous loop to successively separate additional textile items from the pile of textile items P. Upon being dropped into textile receiving area <b>18</b>, textile items may be conveyed in a spaced manner through the inspection station. Prior to the textile items leaving the inspection station, individual textile items may be sorted by human action or automatic mechanism, and/or counted by photoelectric eye <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, after a predetermined quantity of textiles (set by automated bagging system <b>20</b>) are counted, photoelectric eye <b>42</b> may send a signal to gate <b>40</b>, directing gate <b>40</b> to close (typically after a time delay). While gate <b>40</b> is closed, automated bagging system <b>20</b> may cycle, reposition a new bag to collect the textile items coming off the end of belt conveyor <b>38</b>, and then signal gate <b>40</b> to open so that textile items may begin to fill the next bag. The filled bag may then leave the area surrounding automated bagging system <b>20</b> via exit conveyor <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Some examples of a textile separating apparatus may include additional control features to further the accuracy and efficiency of the textile separating apparatus. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the examples of a textile separating apparatus including advancement mechanism <b>30</b>, advancement mechanism <b>30</b> may feed textiles towards transport mechanism <b>14</b> at a controlled rate and/or on an intermittent timed basis with the use of a repeat cycle timer <b>48</b>, which provides for control of advancement mechanism <b>30</b>. Rate of processing may therefore be independent of the speed of any individual operator, and productivity of the system may be readily determined.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The feed rate may be adjustable to ensure that the rate of travel is timed to supply an appropriate quantity of textile items to transport mechanism <b>14</b> based on the size of the textile items. If the rate of travel is too slow, there may be a gap in the textile items selected and fed through the process. If the rate is too high, the textile items may &#x201c;bunch up&#x201d; at transport mechanism <b>14</b> and cause double picks (meaning that pick member <b>16</b> may select more than one item at a time), thereby causing extra work for an inspector. Other operations and/or conveyors in the textile separating apparatus may also have rate adjustment ability. The present textile separating apparatus typically may be operated to process approximately 4,800 textile items per operator hour.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The components expressed so far descriptively, may be mounted on a framework that supports such components so that they are positioned for the maximum mechanical and operational advantage inherently possible between the components. Scaling of the individual components, and overall machine proportions, are variable and relative to the users operational specifications. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, some examples of textile separating apparatus <b>10</b> may be mounted on a wheeled framework for ease of movement, for example, around a warehouse.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the claimed method and apparatus for separating textiles, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the system. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present subject matter relates generally to drilling, and, more particularly, to a one-step drilling system and methods of using same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are many types of machines in use today for drilling holes such as dowel holes, pocket holes, and so forth, in various types of workpieces. Pocket hole wood joinery involves joining boards by inserting a fastener at an angle through the edge of one board into the other. Such joints are commonly used for face frames, cabinet boxes, leg-to-rail joinery in chairs and tables, and so forth. Drill guides, jigs, and pocket hole boring machines are used to drill the holes through which the fasteners or pocket screws are inserted into the adjoining workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional devices utilize a two-step process to manually clamp and then drill. Such a process is inconvenient and time-consuming. Additionally, such clamps do not readily accommodate common material thicknesses. Other devices utilize a one-step process, but require an expensive pneumatic air cylinder with a clamp pad. The use of pneumatics further requires a source of air, i.e., an air compressor, which adds to the inconvenience and expense.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a need in the art for an improved drilling system.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A non-pneumatic drilling system comprising a handle connected to an adjustable clamp and to a drill switch, wherein the adjustable clamp is not in contact with a workpiece and the drill switch is off when the handle is in a first position, further wherein the adjustable clamp is in contact with the workpiece and the drill switch is on when the handle is in a second position is described. In most embodiments, the drill switch is turned on prior to the handle reaching the second position, i.e., at some point after the handle is moved away from the first position. In one embodiment the adjustable clamp is about 0.01 to 0.2 inches above the workpiece when the handle is in the first position. In one embodiment, the second position is lower in height than the first position, and the handle moves from the first position to the second position when manually pulled in a downwardly direction. The drill switch is in electrical contact with a drill, and the drill and adjustable clamp start moving at about the same time as the handle is being moved from the first position to the second position, such that a workpiece can be clamped and drilled in one step. In one embodiment, the drill is secured at an angle of about 15 degrees to a work surface, on which the workpiece is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the adjustable clamp comprises a compression spring in contact with a clamp pad, and the clamp pad remains stationary on the workpiece as the compression spring applies increasing force. The system is designed so that a drill bit, which is insertable into the drill, contacts the workpiece after the clamp pad contacts the workpiece. The adjustable clamp is in contact with the workpiece and the drill bit is at its maximum depth within the workpiece when the handle is in a third position, which, in one embodiment, is lower in height than the second position, such that the handle moves from the second position to the third position when manually pulled in a downwardly direction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment the handle is located at an angle of about 45 degrees from the workpiece when in the third position. In one embodiment, the ratio of movement between the adjustable clamp and drill is between about 1:1 and about 1:10 as the handle moves from the first position to the third position. In most embodiments, the handle is pivotally connected to a central axis rod via a bracket, the adjustable clamp is pivotally connected to the central axis rod via a linkage arm and the drill is pivotally connected to the central axis rod with a connector. In one embodiment, the linkage arm is connected to the central axis rod with a linkage bracket, and the linkage arm comprises first and second linkage arms, wherein the first linkage arm is pivotally connected to the linkage bracket at one end and pivotally connected to the second linkage arm at an opposing end, and the second linkage arm is pivotally connected to the adjustable clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the system further comprises a clamping tower secured to the adjustable clamp and pivotally connected to the second linkage arm such that upward force from the first and second linkage arms is transferred to a downward clamping force on the adjustable clamp as the handle is moved in a downwardly direction. In one embodiment, guide rods connected to the drill and to a guide block secured beneath the work surface are used to guide the drill bit into the guide block and up through an opening in the work surface during drilling of the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A pocket hole boring machine comprising a power source connected to a cabinet, the cabinet having a work surface; a clamp assembly secured to the cabinet on top of the work surface; a drill secured to the cabinet beneath the work surface, the drill electrically connected to a remote switch and pivotally connected to the clamp assembly; and non-pneumatic means for simultaneously activating the remote switch and the clamp assembly with a handle, wherein the handle, clamp assembly and drill are each connected to a central axis rod is also provided. The machine can further include, in one embodiment, a fence secured to the cabinet. The fence is used to support movable stops, such as flip-stops, although the invention is not so limited. In one embodiment, the non-pneumatic means for activating the remote switch is provided by removing contact between the linkage arm and a tab located in the switch to close the electrical circuit when the handle is manually moved away from a first position. In one embodiment, the clamp assembly is pivotally connected to the central axis rod with a linkage arm which extends beneath the work surface, and the means for activating the clamp assembly is provided by pivoting the linkage arm against a clamping tower secured to the clamping assembly when the handle is manually moved away from a first position. The clamp assembly preferably contains a compression spring which continues to apply increasing force as the handle is moved from the first position to the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An adjustable clamp assembly for securing a workpiece to a work surface comprising a compression spring surrounding a spring rod, wherein the adjustable clamp assembly is adjustable in length and oriented substantially perpendicular to the workpiece with a linkage arm connected to the work surface is also provided. In one embodiment, the compression spring can be preloaded by securing a clamp pad to the spring rod. In a particular embodiment, the spring rod has a threaded end and the compression spring is preloaded by threading the clamp pad onto the spring rod. In one embodiment, the compression spring is preloaded at least about 125 lb<sub>f</sub>. In one embodiment, the adjustable clamp assembly is adjustable in length with an adjusting knob securable to a fixed section, the fixed section pivotally connected to the linkage arm. In a particular embodiment, the fixed section has fixed section outer threads and the adjusting knob has adjusting knob inner threads securable to the fixed section outer threads. In one embodiment, the adjustable clamp assembly further comprises a locking knob to lock the fixed section and adjusting knob in place. The compression spring can provide up to about 0.5 inches of displacement to the clamp assembly, such as up to about 0.25 inches. In one embodiment, the compression spring provides up to about 300 lb<sub>f </sub>of force to a workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the invention further include a method comprising activating an adjustable clamp assembly and a remote drill switch substantially simultaneously by pulling a handle connected to the adjustable clamp assembly and the remote drill switch in a downwardly direction, wherein clamping and drilling are completed in one step without the use of compressed air. In one embodiment, the method further comprises drilling a hole in a workpiece with a drill connected to the remote drill switch, the drill having a drill bit connected thereto. In one embodiment, the method further comprises pushing the handle in an upwardly direction after the hole has been drilled. In most embodiments, the drill and adjustable clamp assembly start moving at about the same time. The drill switch is in off when the handle is in a first position. The drill switch is on when the handle is in either a lower second position or an even lower third position.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the handle is a lever and the user operates the device by first positioning the material to be drilled and then pulling the lever forward. This motion activates the switch, which in turn activates the drill motor and further throws or moves the clamp assembly. The drill stroke is completed by continuing to pull on the lever and then returning the lever to its home position. Although the lever is operated manually, the automated features of the device allows the user to quickly drill holes, such as pocket holes.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the drilling systems and methods described herein allow a user, for the first time, to use a semi-automatic device to clamp material of variable dimensional thicknesses and drill holes, such as pocket holes, in one step without the use of a pneumatic clamping cylinder.</p>

The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of embodiments of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one embodiment of a novel pocket hole boring machine <b>100</b>. In this embodiment, the machine <b>100</b> comprises a cabinet <b>102</b> housing a drill <b>108</b> pivotally connected to an adjustable clamp, clamping cylinder or clamp assembly <b>110</b>. The cabinet <b>102</b> (shown partially cut away in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) comprises a work surface (i.e., worktable) <b>101</b>, a back surface <b>105</b> with a back surface opening <b>107</b>, two side surfaces <b>111</b> (one shown) and a front surface <b>113</b>. In some embodiments, the cabinet <b>102</b> further comprises legs. The worktable <b>101</b> has a top surface <b>104</b>, a bottom surface <b>103</b>, and a drill bit opening <b>106</b>. In this embodiment, the machine <b>100</b> further houses upper and lower linkage arms, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, respectively, a fence <b>116</b> secured to top surface <b>104</b> and in communication with one or more stops <b>118</b> to guide a workpiece (not shown). Although triangular stops are shown, in practice any suitable type of stops <b>118</b> known in the art can be used. The fence <b>116</b> can be secured to the worktable <b>101</b> from the topside or underside and, in one embodiment, is movable forwards or backwards to change the position of a pocket hole from the edge of the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The machine <b>100</b> further houses a central axis rod <b>119</b> connected to the top surface <b>104</b> with a central axis rod bracket <b>121</b> and secured in place to an opening in a central axis bracket <b>121</b> with a securing device <b>123</b>, such as the nut shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A connector or connecting rod <b>120</b> connects the drill <b>108</b> to the central axis rod <b>119</b> (shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref>). A guide block <b>126</b> is secured to the bottom surface <b>103</b> of the worktable <b>101</b> by any suitable means, such as with threaded screws from the top. Two guide rods <b>124</b> are removably secured into guide rod openings in the guide block <b>126</b> in any suitable manner (e.g., set screws, threads, press fit, etc.) and are in substantially parallel alignment with a guide bushing <b>128</b> removably secured into bushing openings in the guide block <b>126</b> by any suitable means (e.g., set screws, threads, press fit, etc.), although the invention is not so limited. In other embodiments, no guide bushing <b>128</b> is used. However, the guide bushing <b>128</b> is useful in supporting a drill bit <b>109</b> and the two guide rods <b>124</b> during drilling, keeping them in substantially parallel alignment and minimizing deflection of the drill bit <b>109</b> as it contacts a workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The central axis rod <b>119</b> is in turn connected to the upper and lower linkage arms, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, respectively, by a linkage arm bracket <b>125</b>, which also extends beneath the worktable <b>101</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). More specifically, in this embodiment, the linkage arm bracket <b>125</b> is connected to a first end <b>127</b> of the lower linkage arm at pivot point &#x201c;A&#x201d; with a central axis/lower linkage pivot pin <b>129</b>, while a second end <b>131</b> of the lower linkage arm <b>114</b> is connected to a first end <b>132</b> of the upper linkage arm <b>112</b> at pivot point &#x201c;B&#x201d; with an upper linkage/lower linkage pivot pin <b>134</b>. The central axis rod <b>119</b> is also connected to a handle <b>136</b> via a handle bracket <b>137</b> as shown, the handle <b>136</b> also having a hand grip <b>138</b> secured at its opposing end as shown. In the embodiment shown in the figures, the handle <b>136</b> is a lever pivotally connected via a handle bracket <b>137</b> to the central axis rod <b>119</b>, which serves as a fulcrum. Although the handle <b>136</b> is shown as movable in a downwardly direction to activate the clamp assembly <b>110</b> and switch (<b>202</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the invention is not so limited. In other embodiments, the handle <b>136</b> may be a lever designed to move in an upwardly direction to activate the components. In yet other embodiments, any other type of suitable handle <b>136</b> can be used. Although the connection between the handle <b>136</b> and the handle bracket <b>137</b> is at an acute angle as shown, this is provided in order to orient the handle <b>136</b> at an appropriate angle to the user and not to provide a pivot point. In other embodiments, there is no bracket <b>137</b> and the handle <b>136</b>, having any suitable bend, connects directly to and pivots on the central axis rod <b>119</b>. The clamp assembly <b>110</b> is connected to a second end <b>140</b> of the upper linkage arm <b>112</b> at pivot point &#x201c;C&#x201d; with a clamp/tower bracket <b>144</b> and clamp assembly pivot pin <b>146</b>. A clamping tower <b>142</b> is connected to the upper linkage arm <b>112</b> with a clamping tower bracket <b>148</b> at pivot point &#x201c;D&#x201d; with a clamping tower pivot pin <b>150</b>. A clamp assembly bracket <b>152</b> also fixedly secures the clamp assembly <b>110</b> to the clamping tower <b>142</b> below pivot point &#x201c;D&#x201d; as shown. Thus, the clamping tower <b>142</b> not only secures the clamp assembly <b>110</b> in a fixed position during use, it also provides support for pivot point &#x201c;D&#x201d; with the upper linkage arm <b>112</b>. The clamping tower <b>142</b> therefore needs to be of a sufficient height to not only be secured to the upper linkage arm <b>112</b> at pivot point &#x201c;D&#x201d; but to also provide means to fix the clamp assembly <b>110</b> in place during use, such as with the clamp assembly bracket <b>152</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Although the clamping tower <b>142</b> is shown attached to the fence <b>116</b>, such as with a threaded bolt inserted from under the fence <b>116</b> (not shown), in other embodiments, the clamping tower <b>142</b> is located behind the fence <b>116</b>, and extends to the worktable <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The pivot points (A-D) allow the device to operate in one smooth and continuous manner to complete a drilling operation. Additionally, pivot point &#x201c;C&#x201d; allows the force provided by the clamp assembly <b>110</b> to be substantially perpendicular to the top surface <b>104</b>, thus minimizing the force required to perform the operation. Pivot point &#x201c;D&#x201d; allows for the transfer of force from an upward force provided by the upper and lower linkage arms, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, to a downward clamping force as the handle <b>136</b> is pulled.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The clamp assembly <b>110</b> is comprised of a compression spring <b>170</b>, a clamp pad <b>172</b>, a clamp guide <b>174</b>, an adjusting knob <b>176</b>, a fixed section <b>178</b> and a locking knob <b>180</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, both the locking knob <b>180</b> and the adjusting knob <b>176</b> have a knurled outer surface which provide a raised surface to improve gripping, although the invention is not so limited. The fixed section <b>178</b> is connected to the clamp/tower bracket <b>144</b> by any suitable means, such as with a threaded connection. The adjusting knob <b>176</b> is connectable to the fixed section <b>178</b> on one end by any suitable means. In one embodiment, the adjusting knob <b>176</b> is slideable within the fixed section <b>178</b>, similar to the type of adjustment mechanism found on a microscope. In another embodiment, the adjusting knob <b>176</b> screws onto the fixed section <b>178</b> (such as with threads <b>512</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The adjusting knob <b>176</b> extends through the inside of the clamp guide <b>174</b> and also provides a housing or covering for the compression spring <b>170</b> on the other end (seen below the clamp assembly bracket <b>152</b>). The adjusting knob <b>176</b> is used to adjust the clamp assembly <b>110</b> for variations in material thicknesses of the workpiece (not shown). In the embodiment, in which the adjusting knob <b>176</b> and fixed section <b>178</b> are screwed together, adjusting knob inner threads move up or down along outer threads of the fixed section as the adjusting knob <b>176</b> is turned within the clamp guide <b>174</b>. In most embodiments, the workpiece must be at least about &#x201c;&#x215c;-inches&#x201d; in thickness. Once the desired position is reached, the locking knob <b>180</b> is turned to lock the adjusting knob <b>176</b> into position, thus securing the clamp assembly <b>110</b> in place. The compression spring <b>170</b> provides desired &#x201c;give&#x201d; in the clamp assembly <b>110</b>. Additional details about the clamp assembly <b>110</b>, including the compression spring <b>170</b>, are discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a power source <b>152</b> (such as an ac/dc current) provides power for the electric box <b>153</b> via a power cord <b>155</b>. The electric box <b>153</b> is in turn electrically connected via suitable wiring <b>303</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to a switch <b>202</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The switch <b>202</b> is in turn connected to the motor <b>160</b> via a motor wire <b>154</b>. In other embodiments, the power source <b>152</b> is any other suitable source of power such as batteries, and the like, further including any alternative source of renewable power. However, as it is desirable not to run the motor <b>160</b> continuously, means are preferably provided in the various embodiments to turn off the motor <b>160</b> in between drilling operations, such as with the switch <b>202</b> discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The drill <b>108</b> comprises a motor <b>160</b>, motor bracket <b>162</b>, the guide rods <b>124</b>, drill bit <b>109</b>, collet <b>164</b> and, preferably a stop collar <b>166</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, although the invention is not so limited. It is also possible to complete the drilling operation without a stop collar <b>166</b> (See, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the drill <b>108</b> does not require any type of handle as it is activated by the user pulling down on the handle <b>136</b>, such as with the hand grip <b>138</b>. The collet <b>164</b> is secured to the motor <b>160</b> in any suitable manner. In one embodiment, the connection is a threaded connection. The drill bit <b>109</b> is secured to the collet <b>164</b> in any suitable manner as is known in the art, such as with a friction connection, set screws and the like. The drill <b>108</b> is secured at an angle of about 15 degrees to a workpiece in order to drill pocket holes, although the invention is not so limited. The drill <b>108</b> can be secured at any desirable angle as needed to drill any other type of hole. The motor <b>160</b> can provide any suitable amount of power. In one embodiment, the motor <b>160</b> provides anywhere from &#xbd; hp up to 1&#xbd; hp, although the invention is not so limited. In a particular embodiment, a &#xbe; hp motor is used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The guide rods <b>124</b> can extend any suitable distance into the guide block <b>126</b> and, in one embodiment, extend about one (1) to three (3) inches into the guide block <b>126</b>. Although two guide rods <b>124</b> are shown, in practice any number of guide rods <b>124</b> can be used as long as the intended function is performed. The motor <b>160</b> is mounted to the motor bracket <b>162</b> in any suitable manner. In one embodiment, the connection is a threaded connection. The motor bracket <b>162</b> preferably has suitable bushings <b>163</b> (one shown) to enhance the sliding motion of the drill <b>108</b> along the guide rods <b>124</b>. In one embodiment, springs (not shown) are also present on the guide rods <b>124</b> between the guide block <b>126</b> and the bushings <b>163</b> to help return the drill <b>108</b> to its initial position once the drilling is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The motor <b>160</b> is designed to provide the requisite revolutions per minute (RPM) and torque required for a pocket hole drilling operation. Typically the RPM ranges from about 2200 to 2800 RPM and the torque ranges from about 50 to 75 in/lb<sub>f</sub>. It is also important that the motor <b>160</b> be small enough to fit into the cabinet <b>102</b> and be able to easily move along the guide rods <b>124</b> in response to the hand grip <b>138</b> (and hence the handle <b>136</b>) being pulled down by the user. In a particular embodiment, the motor is no greater than about nine (9) inches in length and no greater than about five (5) inches in diameter, although a larger motor <b>160</b> could be used, depending on the size of the cabinet <b>102</b>. The motor <b>160</b> can be any suitable weight as long as it can easily slide along the guide rods <b>124</b>. In one embodiment, the motor is less than about eight (8) lbs, although the invention is not so limited. In a particular embodiment, the motor is about nine (9) inches in length, about five (5) inches in diameter, providing about 2600 RPM and about 65 in/lb<sub>f </sub>of torque. In one embodiment, Groschopp, Inc., having offices in Sioux Center, Iowa, provides certain basic components for the motor <b>160</b>, such as an armature, magnetic field, shaft, gears and bearings, as is known in the art, although such components are available from any number of commercial suppliers. Other components such as wiring, brushes (to transfer current and create the rotation needed for generating the appropriate RPM's) and housing can also be purchased commercially or custom made for a particular application. The housing should be designed so that the components are securely maintained in the proper position to allow the magnetic field to be substantially concentric to the armature and shaft. Additional considerations for the housing include providing proper air flow so the motor <b>160</b> does not overheat.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the drill <b>108</b> is a conventional handheld drill (such as a Bosch drill made by the Bosch Power Tool Company having offices in Chicago, Ill.) with appropriate modifications to change the drill <b>108</b> from being activated by a trigger in the handle to being remotely controlled as described. In one embodiment, the drill <b>108</b> is controlled remotely with a wireless device. Alternatively, the drill can be locked in the &#x201c;on&#x201d; position, although most drills are not designed for continuous operation and should be turned on and off as needed. Additional design considerations involve proper mounting of the drill <b>108</b> to a bracket <b>162</b> and to the guide rods <b>124</b>. In one embodiment a Bosch Model 1005VSRK &#x215c;&#x2033; electric drill is used after appropriate modifications have been made.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the motor <b>160</b> (not shown) is activated by a switch <b>202</b> secured to the bottom surface <b>103</b> with a bracket <b>310</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), although the invention is not so limited. The switch <b>202</b> can be located in any suitable position and secured to the worktable <b>101</b> in any suitable manner. In one embodiment, the switch <b>202</b> is an on/off switch that is &#x201c;off&#x201d; only when the handle <b>136</b> is in its &#x201c;home&#x201d; or inactive position, i.e., the &#x201c;up&#x201d; position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>. Specifically, linkage arm bracket <b>125</b> extends down below the central axis rod <b>119</b>, passes through an upper surface slot <b>204</b>, and connects to the connecting rod <b>120</b> with a connecting rod bracket <b>206</b> below the top surface <b>104</b> of the worktable <b>101</b> as shown. The back surface opening <b>107</b> allows the components to move freely in and out of the cabinet <b>102</b> as needed. In this embodiment, the switch <b>202</b> is activated by removing contact with a tab <b>208</b>, which is secured to the linkage arm bracket <b>125</b> as shown, although the invention is not so limited. Any suitable means can be used to activate the switch <b>202</b>, including providing means to contact the switch <b>202</b> with a suitable device in order to activate it (versus removing contact with a component, such as the tab <b>208</b>, in order to activate it). Basically, any device which allows the switch <b>202</b> to change from having an open electrical circuit (no power) to a closed electrical circuit (power) can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the switch <b>202</b> is not depressed (closed electrical circuit) because there is no contact with the tab <b>208</b> and therefore power is running to the motor <b>160</b> (not shown), causing the motor <b>160</b> to be on. The handle <b>136</b> is therefore not in its uppermost or &#x201c;home&#x201d; position. Conversely, when the switch <b>202</b> is in contact with, i.e., depressed by the tab <b>208</b>, the motor <b>160</b> would be off. Again, this would occur when the handle <b>136</b> is in the uppermost &#x201c;home&#x201d; position (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, suitable wiring <b>303</b> is provided as is known in the art to connect the switch <b>202</b> to the electrical box <b>153</b>. Suitable wiring <b>154</b> is also provided to connect the motor <b>160</b> to the electrical box <b>153</b> as previously discussed. Any suitable type of switch <b>202</b> can be used. In one embodiment, the switch <b>202</b> is a spring loaded switch which responds to pressure and removal of pressure by the tab <b>208</b>. See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which provides another view of the various connections underneath the worktable <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The various components of the pocket hole boring machine <b>100</b> can be made from any suitable materials and be of any suitable size and shape. The upper and lower linkage arms, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, respectively, are necessarily made from materials having sufficient strength to transfer the requisite forces across their length without any bending and flexing. In one embodiment, these components are made from metal (e.g., steel or aluminum). Other materials, such as wood or plastic can be used, but would likely require substantial thickness to have the requisite strength. In one embodiment, the material is &#x201c; 3/16-inch&#x201d; steel. In one embodiment, the force transferred through these components is greater than about 200 lb<sub>f </sub>up to about 300 lb<sub>f</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the upper linkage arm <b>112</b> is about four (4) to seven (7) inches in length and the lower linkage arm <b>114</b> is about three (3) to five (5) inches in length, although the invention is not so limited. The linkage arm bracket <b>125</b> can also be any suitable shape and size, and in one embodiment, the upper portion of the linkage arm bracket <b>125</b> extending from the center axis rod <b>119</b> to the first end <b>127</b> of the lower linkage arm <b>114</b>) is about one (1) to three (3) inches in length and the lower portion of the bracket extending from the center axis rod <b>119</b> to the connecting rod bracket <b>206</b> is at least about two to three times longer than the upper portion. In a particular embodiment, the upper linkage arm <b>112</b> is about 5.9 inches, the lower linkage arm <b>114</b> is about 4.2 inches, the upper portion of the linkage arm bracket <b>125</b> is about 1.8 inches and the lower portion of the linkage arm bracket <b>125</b> is about 3.8 inches. In other embodiments, the lower linkage arm <b>114</b> is about the same size or larger than the upper linkage arm <b>114</b>. Generally, however, the upper portion of the linkage arm bracket <b>125</b> will be shorter than the linkage arm components, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, although the invention is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The clamping tower <b>142</b> and fence <b>116</b>, as well as the stops <b>118</b> can also be made from metal, such as steel or aluminum, wood or plastic. In embodiments in which the clamping tower <b>142</b> is secured to the fence <b>116</b> the fence <b>116</b> should be made from a material capable of withstanding the force provided by the clamping tower <b>142</b> during operation. The clamping tower <b>142</b> can also be of any suitable size and shape. In one embodiment, the clamping tower <b>142</b> is a substantially rectangular shape with a height of sufficient dimension to accommodate the height of the clamp assembly <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the clamping tower <b>142</b> has a height of sufficient dimension to provide a suitable pivot point &#x201c;D&#x201d; for optimum performance of the clamp assembly <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the clamping tower <b>142</b> has a height of about four (4) to seven (7) inches or more, depending on the size of the clamp assembly <b>110</b> and linkage arms <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, as well as whether or not the clamping tower <b>142</b> is secured to the fence <b>116</b> or the worktable <b>101</b>. In another embodiment, the clamping tower <b>142</b> has a height of about five (5) to six (6) inches. In one embodiment, the clamping tower <b>142</b> has a width of sufficient dimension to attach the clamp assembly <b>110</b> with the bracket <b>152</b> and a depth of sufficient dimension to accommodate the pivot bracket <b>150</b>, such as about one (1) to 2.5 inches. In a particular embodiment, the clamping tower <b>142</b> has a height of about 5.4 inches, and a width and depth of about 1.5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Other components, such as the guide block <b>126</b> are made from any suitable material. In one embodiment, the guide block <b>126</b> is a machined block of aluminum of any desired size and shape, as long as the intended function can be performed. In one embodiment, the guide block <b>126</b> is a rectangular piece of material about four (4) inches in length, six (6) inches in width and about 1.25 inches in height or thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The handle <b>136</b>, central axis rod <b>119</b>, as well as the various brackets (e.g., <b>121</b>, <b>125</b>, <b>148</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>127</b> and <b>162</b>) should also be made of materials having sufficient strength, such as metal such as aluminum or steel. Although wood or plastic can be used, components made from these materials are likely more bulky and/or expensive. The central axis rod <b>119</b> can have any suitable diameter and length. In one embodiment, the central axis rod <b>119</b> has a diameter of about 0.25 to 0.75 inches and a length of about six (6) to 12 inches. The handle <b>136</b> can also be any suitable size and shape. In one embodiment, the end of the handle <b>136</b> nearest the hand grip <b>138</b> is elevated about 10 to 14 inches from the worktable <b>101</b> when in the off or home position, although the actual length of the handle <b>136</b> may be greater if it has a bend, or is affixed to the handle bracket <b>137</b> at an angle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The hand grip <b>138</b> can further be made of any suitable material which provides an adequate grip including all of the materials mentioned as well as ceramics, rubber and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The worktable <b>101</b> can also be made from any suitable material or materials, such as metal, wood or plastic, although wood or plastic surfaces need to be sufficiently thick to accept the connectors used to mount components to the worktable <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, the upper surface <b>104</b> of the worktable <b>101</b> is made from at least two different types of material (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). In one embodiment, the worktable <b>101</b> is made from steel. In a particular embodiment, the worktable <b>101</b> is an approximately &#x201c;&#xbc;-inch&#x201d; stamped steel plate about 13.5 inches in length and width. In an alternative the worktable <b>101</b> is machined aluminum, although this would be more expensive than steel. The worktable <b>101</b>, as well as the entire cabinet <b>102</b> can further be provided in multiple components which are secured together by any suitable means (such as the cabinet <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> in which a portion of the cabinet <b>102</b> has been removed to provide a view of the components inside).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The various pivot pins can also be made from any suitable material. In one embodiment, some or all of the pivot pins are steel clevis pins. In another embodiment, some or all of the pivot pins are threaded bolts with washers and nuts which are not tightened completely so as to allow independent pivoting motion of the various components. Although use of bolts, washers and nuts are more expensive, it allows a given pivot point to pivot with very little tolerance, thus providing a &#x201c;sturdy&#x201d; feel to the clamp assembly <b>110</b> as compared with a conventional pin, such as a clevis pin. In one embodiment, bolts, washers and nuts are used at pivot points &#x201c;B&#x201d; and &#x201c;D,&#x201d; while clevis pins are used at pivot points &#x201c;A&#x201d; and &#x201c;C,&#x201d; although the invention is not so limited. As noted above, in another embodiment, pivot point &#x201c;D&#x201d; is replaced with a fixed connection.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the clamp assembly <b>110</b> is comprised of the compression spring <b>170</b> surrounding a spring rod <b>504</b> having, in one embodiment, a threaded end <b>505</b>, the clamp pad <b>172</b>, the clamp guide <b>174</b>, the adjusting knob <b>176</b> having, in one embodiment, adjusting knob inner threads <b>512</b>, the fixed section <b>178</b> having, in one embodiment, fixed section outer threads <b>510</b> and the locking knob <b>180</b> having, in one embodiment, locking knob inner threads (not shown). As discussed herein, the compression spring <b>170</b> provides desired &#x201c;give&#x201d; in the clamp assembly <b>110</b>, thus providing the requisite adjustability for the clamp. Specifically, the compression spring <b>170</b>, which is preloaded by threading the clamp pad <b>172</b> onto the threaded end <b>505</b> prior to drilling, allows the clamp pad <b>172</b> to stop on the workpiece and maintain clamping pressure while the user is still continuing to pull on the handle <b>136</b> to complete the drilling cycle. Otherwise, once the clamp pad <b>172</b> contacts the workpiece, the drilling cycle would stop and the drill would not yet have drilled the pocket hole.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The compression spring <b>170</b> also allows a wide range of material thicknesses to be accommodated with any given position of the clamp assembly <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the compression spring <b>170</b> allows for adjustments of up to about &#x201c; 1/16-inch&#x201d; in material thickness either way, for a total range of about &#x201c;&#x215b;-inch&#x201d; in adjustments with any given clamp assembly position. In other embodiments, up to &#x201c;&#xbc;-inch&#x201d; or more of adjustability is provided. However, with adjustment levels in this range, the timing of the drill movement would need to be altered, i.e., slowed, to avoid having the drill bit <b>109</b> contact the workpiece before the clamp pad <b>172</b> does. Such adjustments can be made by adjusting the ratio of movement of the clamp assembly <b>110</b> and drill <b>108</b>, which can include adding slack to delay the movement of the drill <b>108</b>, as discussed below. This ability to adjust is unlike a toggle clamp which provides no range of adjustability at any given position of the clamp assembly <b>110</b>. Additionally, as there is no &#x201c;locking mechanism&#x201d; on the clamp assembly <b>110</b> to lock the clamp pad <b>172</b> into position, the clamp pad <b>172</b> is essentially &#x201c;locked&#x201d; in place by the user when he continues to pull on the arm <b>136</b>, thus allowing a one-step drilling operation. This is unlike conventional machines in which a conventional clamp, such as a toggle clamp, is used in one step to clamp the workpiece and a mechanical arm is used in a separate second step to activate only the drill.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The compression spring <b>170</b> is preferably a helical compression spring or a die spring made from steel and capable of withstanding between about 150 and 300 lb<sub>f </sub>with about 0.25 to 0.75 inches of deflection. In one embodiment, the compression spring <b>170</b> provides up to about 0.5 inches of displacement to the clamp assembly <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, about 0.25 inches of displacement is provided. In one embodiment, the compression spring <b>170</b> is capable of withstanding up to about 300 lb<sub>f </sub>or more at about 0.33 to 0.5 inches of deflection. In one embodiment, the spring is between one (1) and four (4) inches in length and about 0.5 and one (1) inches in diameter. In a particular embodiment a die spring made by Danly IEM, having offices in Cleveland, Ohio, is used. In a particular embodiment, the spring is a Danly DieMax XL spring model no. 9-1206-26 which is about 0.75 inches in diameter, about 1.5 inches in length, capable of withstanding up to about 295.2 lb<sub>f </sub>with a maximum deflection of approximately 0.45 inches. The spring rod <b>504</b> can be any rod around which the compression spring <b>170</b> is wound. In this embodiment, the spring rod <b>504</b> is a bolt with a threaded portion <b>505</b> as shown, such as an approximately 0.3 inch diameter bolt with the threaded portion <b>505</b> having a length of about 0.3 to 0.5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> show the range of motion of the various components throughout a drilling cycle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is in &#x201c;POSITION <b>1</b>&#x201d; which is at the beginning of a drilling cycle and is also likely the position in which the unit is stored. As can be seen, the handle <b>136</b>, having a handle centerline <b>601</b>, is in an up or home position, i.e., any suitable position which allows the switch <b>202</b> to be in an off position (i.e., in this embodiment, in contact with the tab <b>208</b>). In one embodiment, when the handle <b>136</b> is in the home position, the upper end of the handle <b>136</b> is at a vertical distance of about 10 to 14 inches from the worktable <b>101</b>. The upper and lower linkages, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, respectively, having centerlines <b>606</b> and <b>608</b>, respectively, are also in their home positions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, such that the clamp assembly <b>110</b> is at its maximum distance from the worktable <b>101</b>. In this position, distance <b>604</b> is about 0.75 to 1.65 inches. A workpiece <b>650</b> placed under the clamp assembly <b>110</b> has a maximum height <b>652</b> of about 0.75 inches in most embodiments, but can range from about 0.5 to 1.5 inches in height. In most embodiments, the &#x201c;gap&#x201d; (i.e., distance <b>660</b>) between the bottom of the clamp pad <b>172</b> and the top of the workpiece <b>650</b> prior to drilling is about 0.01 to 0.18 inches, up to about 0.2 inches. In one embodiment, distance <b>660</b> is about &#x201c;&#x215b;-inch.&#x201d; Preferably the distance <b>660</b> is sufficiently large to allow the workpiece <b>650</b> to be inserted and removed. However, if distance <b>660</b> is too large the drill bit <b>109</b> will contact the workpiece <b>650</b> before it is fully clamped. The compression spring <b>170</b> is also subject to its minimum load at this point, having only the preload created when the clamp pad <b>172</b> is threaded onto the spring rod <b>506</b>, such that distance <b>605</b> is at its maximum. In one embodiment distance <b>605</b> is between about 0.2 to 0.3 inches when the clamp assembly <b>110</b> is in an unclamped position as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. It is important that a sufficient amount of preload is used to prevent the drill bit from twisting the workpiece during operation. In one embodiment, a preload of between about 125 lb<sub>f </sub>and 175 lb<sub>f </sub>is used. In a particular embodiment, about 150 lb<sub>f </sub>is used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The various components can be positioned at different angles with respect to the worktable <b>101</b> when in their home or off position, depending on their length, size of the clamp assembly <b>110</b>, size of the clamping tower <b>112</b>, and so forth. In one embodiment, angle <b>602</b> between the handle centerline <b>601</b> and the worktable <b>101</b> is between about 52 and 72 degrees. In one embodiment, angle <b>612</b> between the upper linkage centerline <b>606</b> and the worktable <b>101</b> is about five (5) to 15 degrees.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is in &#x201c;POSITION <b>2</b>,&#x201d; which is after the user has pulled the handle <b>136</b> down such that a first contact with the workpiece <b>650</b> has occurred although the compression spring <b>170</b> is still at its minimum load, such that distance <b>605</b> remains the same as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. At this point in time the tab <b>208</b> is now no longer in contact with the switch <b>202</b> such that the motor <b>160</b> (not shown) has started. Additionally, although the compression spring <b>170</b> is still at its minimum load, the clamp assembly <b>110</b> has moved downwardly such that distance <b>604</b> has been reduced by about 0.01 to 0.1 inches (i.e., by the amount of distance <b>660</b>) such that distance <b>604</b> is now the same as distance <b>652</b>, i.e., the height of the workpiece <b>650</b>. Additionally, the various angles between the components have changed. In one embodiment, angle <b>602</b> between the handle <b>136</b> and the worktable <b>101</b> is now about 55 to 60 degrees. In one embodiment, angle <b>612</b> between the upper linkage centerline <b>606</b> and the worktable <b>101</b> is now about three (3) to 13 degrees.

In this embodiment, angle <b>622</b> between the upper linkage <b>112</b> and clamp assembly centerline <b>619</b> is between about 72 to 92 degrees.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the various components in &#x201c;POSITION <b>3</b>,&#x201d; which is after the user has pulled down the handle <b>136</b> a maximum distance, i.e., to an angle of about 45 degrees from the worktable <b>101</b> (although the invention is not so limited), and the drilling operation has just completed. The tab <b>208</b> remains pulled away from the switch <b>202</b> such that the motor <b>160</b> (not shown) is still running. At this point the compression spring <b>170</b> in the clamp assembly <b>110</b> is at its maximum compression and the various angles between the components have further changed. In one embodiment, angle <b>602</b> between the handle <b>136</b> and the worktable <b>101</b> is now about 35 to 40 degrees. In one embodiment, angle <b>612</b> between the upper linkage centerline <b>606</b> and the worktable <b>101</b> is now about zero (0) to ten (10) degrees. In one embodiment, angle <b>614</b> between the lower linkage centerline <b>408</b> and the worktable <b>101</b> is now about 78 to 88 degrees. In this embodiment, angle <b>616</b> between the linkage arm bracket centerline <b>617</b> and the worktable <b>101</b> is about 70 to 80 degrees.

In one embodiment angle <b>602</b> is about 37.5 degrees, angle <b>612</b> is about five (5) degrees, angle <b>614</b> is about 83 degrees, angle <b>616</b> is about 75 degrees, angle <b>620</b> is about 86 degrees and angle <b>622</b> is about 86 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At this point in time, the user would push up on the handle <b>136</b> causing the components to return to the home position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which in turn causes the motor <b>160</b> (not shown) to turn off due to the breaking of the circuit in the switch <b>202</b>, which, in this embodiment, is caused by the tab <b>208</b> again contacting the switch <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As long as the clamp assembly <b>110</b> is holding the workpiece <b>650</b> in place during the entire drilling operation, the ratio of the movement of the clamp assembly <b>110</b> and drill <b>108</b> can vary widely. In one embodiment, such as the embodiment described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, pulling the handle <b>136</b> forward to an angle of approximately 45 degrees with the worktable <b>101</b> causes the clamp assembly <b>110</b> and drill <b>108</b> to move in a ratio of about 1:6. In another embodiment, the ratio is less than 1:6 down to about 1:1 and in yet other embodiments the ratio is greater than 1:6 up to about 1:10. With a ratio of about 1:1, the handle <b>136</b> would likely be longer than with a higher ratio (as handle length affects the amount of travel in the clamp assembly <b>110</b>) and distance <b>604</b> would be much greater than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In most embodiments, the drill <b>108</b> begins its forward movement at substantially the same time the clamp assembly <b>110</b> begins moving, but the timing is such that the clamp pad <b>172</b> contacts the workpiece <b>650</b> before the drill bit <b>109</b> does. (In some instances it may be necessary to make adjustments in timing of drill movement to ensure the clamp contacts the workpiece prior to the drill bit. For example, additional slack can be created in movement of the drill <b>108</b>, such as with a chain linkage between the linkage arm bracket <b>125</b> and the connecting rod bracket <b>206</b>). Once the clamp pad <b>172</b> contacts the workpiece <b>650</b>, it stops moving while the rest of the clamp assembly <b>110</b> continues to compress the compression spring <b>170</b> further until drilling is complete. In embodiments which use a stop collar <b>166</b>, drilling is complete when the stop collar <b>166</b> contacts the guide bushing <b>128</b>, thus preventing any further advancement of the clamp assembly <b>110</b> and drill bit <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, the clamp assembly <b>110</b> travels about 0.25 inches (distance <b>660</b>) while the drill <b>108</b> travels about two (2) inches, such that the ratio of travel between the clamp assembly <b>110</b> and the drill <b>108</b> is about 1:8. Changing distance <b>660</b> will change the ratio of the movement of the clamp assembly <b>110</b> and drill <b>108</b>. It is also important to note that the movement of the clamp assembly <b>110</b>, not including the clamp pad <b>172</b>, will always be constant regardless of the type of compression spring <b>170</b> used. However, the movement of the clamp pad <b>172</b> in relation to the drill <b>108</b> is dependent on the type of compression spring <b>170</b> used. In fact, use of other types and sizes of compression springs <b>170</b> can cause this ratio to vary between about 1:4 up to 1:10. The higher the ratio, the more force is applied to the workpiece <b>650</b> by the clamp assembly <b>110</b> at the beginning of a drilling operation. It is particularly important to have a sufficient amount of force at the beginning of the drilling operation as the drill <b>108</b> starts to enter the workpiece <b>650</b> because the drill bit <b>109</b> has a tendency to move the workpiece <b>650</b> as it rotates and contacts the workpiece <b>650</b>. Once the drill bit <b>109</b> has entered the workpiece <b>650</b> this tendency is lessened. However, the device described herein allows sufficient clamping force to be maintained on the workpiece <b>650</b> throughout the drilling operation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In most embodiments, components are sized appropriately to provide optimum clamping pressure during all phases of the drilling cycle, with least resistance to the user. In a particular embodiment, the compression spring <b>170</b> is about 1.5 inches in length, and compressed to about 1.25 inches in length prior to beginning the drilling operation, thus giving the compression spring <b>170</b> (and therefore the clamp assembly <b>110</b>) a preload of about 164 lb<sub>f</sub>. As the drilling operation progresses and the clamp assembly <b>110</b> bears down on the workpiece <b>650</b>, the compression spring <b>170</b> travels, in one embodiment, another 0.25 inches, for a total of about 0.5 inches total deflection, providing a load of about 328 lb<sub>f</sub>, although, again, the invention is not so limited. It is important to note that the shorter the distance the compression spring <b>170</b> needs to travel, the less force is required by the user to operate the device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a simplified perspective view of a pocket hole drilling machine <b>100</b> in one embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the entire cabinet <b>102</b> can be seen as described herein. Such a unit, having, in one embodiment, a height of between about six (6) and eight (8) inches, is useful for placement on a table or work surface, although, as noted above, the unit can be made as a floor model, and, in some embodiments, can include legs. The machine <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> has the handle <b>136</b> in the up or &#x201c;1&#x201d; position, such that the clamp pad <b>172</b> is not in contact with the workpiece <b>902</b>. Once the handle <b>136</b> is pulled in the downwardly direction, as indicated, the clamp pad <b>172</b> will move down towards to contact the workpiece <b>902</b> as the drill <b>108</b> moves forward, allowing the drill bit <b>109</b> to then make contact with and ultimately drill a hole in the workpiece <b>902</b>. The clamp pad <b>172</b> is then released when the user pushes the handle <b>136</b> back up into the position shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> also shows an alternative stop <b>918</b> which can be used, although, again, the invention is not so limited. Any suitable type of stop can be used. The worktable <b>101</b> in this embodiment is divided into two sections, <b>904</b> and <b>906</b>, each made from a separate type of material. In one embodiment, <b>904</b> is any type of steel or aluminum and <b>906</b> is different type of steel or aluminum or any type of rubber, wood or plastic. In a particular embodiment, section <b>904</b> is made from zinc plated mild steel and section <b>906</b> is made from an acrylic material.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring again to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>8</b>, in use, a user grabs the hand grip <b>138</b> and starts pulling the handle <b>136</b> towards himself in a downwardly direction. This causes the upper and lower linkage arms, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, respectively, to move up and toward the user, allowing the clamp assembly <b>110</b> to move down on top of a workpiece <b>650</b> as discussed herein. Completing the pull of the handle <b>136</b> sends appropriate clamping pressure down on the workpiece <b>650</b>, such as about 200 to 300 lb<sub>f </sub>as discussed, holding it securely to the worktable <b>101</b>. Although higher clamping pressures could be used, pressures greatly in excess of 300 lb<sub>f </sub>likely could become excessive and only increase the work for the user. This action simultaneously pulls the drill <b>108</b> via the connecting rod <b>120</b> along the guide rods <b>124</b> sending the drill bit <b>109</b> up through the drill bit opening <b>106</b> (and optionally through a guide bushing <b>128</b>) and into the workpiece <b>650</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Embodiments of the invention further comprise a method comprising activating an adjustable clamp assembly and a remote drill switch substantially simultaneously by pulling a handle connected to the adjustable clamp assembly and the remote drill switch in a downwardly direction, wherein clamping and drilling are completed in one step without the use of compressed air. In one embodiment, the method further comprises drilling a hole in a workpiece with a drill connected to the remote drill switch, the drill having a drill bit connected thereto. In one embodiment, the method further comprises pushing the handle in an upwardly direction after the hole has been drilled. In most embodiments, the drill and adjustable clamp assembly start moving at about the same time. The drill switch is in off when the handle is in a first position. The drill switch is on when the handle is in either a lower second position or an even lower third position.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The semi-automatic system described herein provides a user, for the first time, with the ability to clamp and drill in a single step without the need for any compressed air, i.e., a non-pneumatic system. The compression spring within the adjustable clamp provides versatility in the thicknesses of boards which can be drilled at a given clamp setting, although adjustments to the length of the clamp can easily be made with an adjusting knob. The movement of the drill in relation to the handle can further be adjusted to provide for varying ratios of movement. This provides for even greater differences in material thicknesses which can be used without the need to adjust the clamp. However, some adjustments in timing of drill movement to ensure the clamp contacts the workpiece prior to the drill bit may be necessary as discussed herein. The result is a precision drilled hole made quickly, conveniently and economically.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement that is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiment shown. For example, the systems and methods described herein could also be used to drill other types of holes such as dowel holes. Additionally, the machine described herein could be altered for use as a line boring machine, or even as a sawing machine, by replacing the drill with a suitably-sized saw. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present subject matter. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that embodiments of this invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the particular example described, the photovoltaic solar panel <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) comprises a shell or external casing <b>3</b>, which in turn comprises a rear wall or tray <b>4</b>, a front wall <b>5</b> facing the wall <b>4</b> and made of a material permeable to light, for example glass, and two terminal closing elements, not visible in the attached figures.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The front wall <b>5</b> and rear wall <b>4</b>, and the terminal closing elements delimit between them a fluid-tight chamber <b>6</b>, which houses a plurality of photovoltaic cells <b>7</b> supported in fixed and pre-set positions by an attachment and supporting plate <b>9</b>, which is also housed in the fluid-tight chamber <b>6</b> and made at least in part of metal material. Within the chamber <b>6</b>, the photovoltaic cells are at least partially embedded in a cooling liquid, which is made to circulate inside the chamber <b>6</b> itself via a hydraulic circuit connected to a heat exchanger (not illustrated) external to the chamber <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The photovoltaic cells <b>7</b> are connected to an external electrical wiring <b>10</b>, terminating with a cable lug or eyelet <b>11</b> via the device <b>1</b>, which comprises a screw <b>12</b> made of metal material that forms a terminal for electrical connection of the photovoltaic cells <b>7</b> with the outside. The screw <b>12</b> comprises a head <b>13</b> housed in the chamber <b>6</b>, set bearing upon a shoulder <b>14</b> provided on the plate <b>9</b> and on the wall <b>4</b> and blocked in an angularly fixed position with respect to the plate <b>9</b>. The screw <b>12</b> comprises, then, an externally threaded stem <b>15</b> extending through two through holes <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, which are made in the plate <b>9</b> and, respectively, in the rear wall <b>4</b>, coaxially to an axis <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the screw <b>12</b>. Fitted on the stem <b>15</b> is an annular seal <b>19</b> comprising, starting from its free end facing the head <b>13</b> of the screw <b>12</b>, a cylindrical end stretch <b>20</b> extending through the hole <b>16</b> and set bearing upon the head <b>13</b> of the screw, an intermediate cylindrical stretch <b>21</b> extending through the hole <b>17</b> and having an outer diameter larger than that of the cylindrical stretch <b>20</b>, and a terminal flange <b>22</b> set bearing upon an outer surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the rear portion <b>4</b>. Screwed on the stem <b>15</b> of the screw <b>12</b> is an internally threaded blind cylindrical portion <b>24</b> of a cap nut <b>25</b> made of metal material, a milled external terminal flange <b>26</b> of which tightens the flange <b>22</b> against the rear wall <b>4</b><i>a </i>to form a fluid-tight seal. Fitted on the blind cylindrical portion <b>24</b> is the cable lug <b>11</b>, which extends, together with a terminal stretch of the wiring <b>10</b>, within a pipe-like body <b>27</b> made of insulating material for electrical insulation from outside of the cable lug <b>11</b> and the cap nut <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The pipe-like body <b>27</b>, which, together with the cap nut <b>25</b>, the seal <b>19</b>, and the cable lug <b>11</b>, forms part of the electrical-connection device <b>1</b>, comprises a barrel-shaped hollow portion <b>28</b>, which surrounds the cable lug <b>11</b>, the cap nut <b>25</b>, and the flange <b>22</b> of the seal <b>19</b>. The pipe-like body <b>27</b> moreover comprises a hollow appendage <b>30</b>, which radially and integrally extends from the barrel-shaped portion <b>28</b> and envelops the electrical wiring <b>10</b> and part of the cable lug <b>11</b> in a fluid-tight manner. The barrel-shaped portion <b>28</b> is set bearing upon the surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the wall <b>4</b> and is coupled to the surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>itself in a fluid-tight manner via two concentric front sealing projections <b>32</b> made in a single piece with the barrel-shaped portion <b>28</b> itself. The portion <b>28</b> partially houses a mushroom-shaped body <b>33</b>, which forms part of the pipe-like body <b>27</b> and closes the portion <b>28</b> in a fluid-tight manner. The body <b>33</b> comprises a head <b>34</b> with a slot for a screw-driver set bearing upon a front surface of the barrel-shaped portion <b>28</b> and coupled to the front surface itself in a fluid-tight manner by a front annular sealing projection <b>35</b> made in a single piece with the barrel-shaped portion <b>28</b> itself. The body <b>33</b> moreover comprises a hollow stem <b>36</b>, which terminates bearing upon the cable lug <b>11</b> and delimits a blind hole <b>37</b>, housing, with radial play, the blind cylindrical portion <b>24</b> of the cap nut <b>25</b>. Blocked in the stem <b>36</b> in a fixed position and coaxially to the axis <b>12</b><i>a </i>is a tightening nut <b>38</b>, which is screwed on an externally threaded terminal stretch <b>39</b> of the blind cylindrical portion <b>24</b> for gripping the cable lug <b>11</b> between the cap nut <b>25</b> and the flange <b>26</b> and forcing in a fluid-tight way the projections <b>32</b> against the surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the rear wall <b>4</b> and the projection <b>35</b> against its head <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Installation of the device <b>1</b> is performed as defined in what follows. During assembly of the solar panel <b>2</b>, the screw <b>12</b> is coupled to the plate <b>9</b>, and then the seal <b>19</b> is inserted in the holes <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> and the flange <b>22</b> brought to bear upon the surface <b>4</b><i>a</i>. At this point, the cap nut <b>25</b> is screwed on the stem <b>15</b> until it forces the flange <b>22</b> against said part and insulates the chamber <b>6</b> from the outside in a fluid-tight manner, after which the cable lug <b>11</b>, previously housed in the barrel-shaped body <b>28</b> is fitted on the portion <b>24</b>, brought to bear upon the flange <b>26</b> and tightened against the flange itself via the lid <b>33</b>, the nut <b>38</b> of which is screwed on the portion <b>24</b> itself and gripped by pack-tightening together the plate <b>9</b>, the tubular portion <b>28</b>, and the cable lug <b>11</b>, to form in this way an external fluid-tight chamber <b>40</b> insulated from the chamber <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">From the foregoing, it appears evident how the characteristics of implementation of the device <b>1</b> described, on the one hand, render the chamber housing the photovoltaic cells fluid-tight preventing any leakage of liquid or entry of external agents into the chamber itself and, on the other, insulate electrically from outside the cable lug <b>11</b>, part of the corresponding electrical wiring and the stem of the screw <b>12</b> for electrical connection through the casing by enclosing them in a dedicated chamber. Since the chamber <b>40</b> is fluid-tight, it receives and withholds any possible leakage of fluid from the chamber <b>6</b>, preventing the fluid from being dispersed into the surrounding environment, thus contaminating it, once again, however, without ever jeopardizing the electrical functionality of the solar panel. It is therefore evident that the device <b>1</b> described presents an efficiency and reliability that are not only high but are practically invariant over time.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">From the foregoing, it appears evident that modifications and variations may be made to the device <b>1</b> described herein, without thereby departing from the scope of protection defined by the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In particular, the screw <b>12</b> could be different from the one indicated and, for example, of the stud-screw type with a terminal or intermediate portion screwed in a threaded through hole of the plate <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Finally, from the foregoing it appears evident that the device <b>1</b> described can find applications different from the one indicated and, in particular, in all the cases in which is it becomes necessary to make a fluid-tight electrical connection through a wall separating two environments, at least one of which houses or is traversed by a liquid.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to French Patent Application No. 06/04462 filed 18 May 2006, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This present invention concerns a life-saving garment, in particular intended for rescue at sea.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The principal application of the invention is in the creation of a life jacket intended to be worn by individual adults or children engaged in nautical activities, whether in a professional capacity, and fishing crews in particular, or members of the merchant navy, coastguards, coastal rescue crews or the staff of oil rigs, but also for leisure activities and in particular intended for pleasure sailors, regatta crews, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This garment can consist, though not exclusively, of a jacket or vest, and it is this example which will be detailed in this present application.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Nevertheless, the solutions described for the jacket are also easily transferable to other types of garment covered by the invention, such as watch-keepers' jackets in particular, or indeed work overalls.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many types of life jacket exist on the market and standardised life jackets in particular.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first particularly common type of life jacket is a keyhole model of generally triangular design with a hole for passage of the wearer's head.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This type of life jacket nevertheless has drawbacks, and in particular its structure is relatively rigid and cannot be worn continuously in comfort by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other words, this life jacket is worn only when immediate danger is foreseen, and in particular in the event of a sinking incident.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another type of particularly common life jacket consists of a jacket that surrounds the trunk of the wearer and that has two openings for passage of the arms and a hood at the collar. This type of jacket is used particularly in nautical sports.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This type of jacket has one major drawback in that it does not have a neck design that adequately protects the neck of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This drawback is particularly troublesome because this is a very vulnerable area, in particular because of the position of a person overboard at sea, when the head and as a consequence the respiratory tracts must be kept clear and protected from the water in order to increase the chances of survival.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">This present invention has as its purpose to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, and to this end, to propose a life jacket that can be worn continuously by a user without being an impediment to his activities.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another objective of this present invention is to propose a life jacket which, when the user is in the water, provides optimum support for the head, that is at the sides and at the rear.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another objective of this present invention is to propose a life jacket that, once fitted, requires no particular manipulation of the jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another objective of this present invention is to propose a life jacket that is particularly strong and reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To this end, the life jacket according to invention includes a collar that is intended to be positioned behind the head of a user, and a main body attached to two lateral extremities of the collar.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the invention, the jacket also includes positioning resources designed to pass the collar from a down position, in which it is intended to rest upon the top of the back, to an up position, in which it is intended to rest behind the head.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">This characteristic of the positioning resources is used to create a life jacket with two positions, one called the rest position corresponding to the configuration of the life jacket when the user is out of the water, and a so-called safety position with the collar raised and holding the head at the sides and at the back, when in the water.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the invention, the collar has a convex configuration in the down position and a concave configuration in the up position.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">This characteristic allows the shape of the collar to be adjusted as a function of its position either at the back of the user, or behind the head of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the invention, it is arranged advantageously that the positioning resources include elastic tensioning resources between the main body and the collar, and/or between different elements of the collar, and a hinge to provide a pivoting connection between the body and the collar.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">This advantageous characteristic allows automatic passage between the two positions of the life jacket when the user falls into the water, with passage to the concave position being obtained by the pressure of the water on the collar, and with passage from the concave position to the convex position being effected manually.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Advantageously, the hinge can include a collar that is designed to at least partially hug the neck of the user, and that is connected to the main body, this collar being surrounded by a strip of material connected to or forming part of the collar. This arrangement allows good positioning of the life jacket on the user, and in particular in the area of the neck and shoulders, and provides close contact between the jacket and the lower part of the neck.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an implementation variant, it is arranged that the elasticity of the tensioning resources is not placed at the junction between the collar parts, but at the collar parts themselves, using deformable foams whose controlled deformation creates the elastic tension.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this implementation variant, the junction zones between the collar parts are pre-tensioned.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Like the first method of implementation of the elastic tensioning resources, there is again automatic passage between the two positions of the life jacket when the user falls into the water, because of the pressure of the water exerted on the collar.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the invention, it is also possible to arrange that the tensioning resources include a bellows or concertina element and at least one elastic element connecting the collar to the top edge of part of the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">This arrangement firstly enables the passage of water between the collar and the main body to be prevented and, secondly protects the elastic element and in particular reduces the risk of tearing the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the invention, it is also possible to arrange, in addition to the tensioning resources, for additional tensioning resources that also include a bellows or concertina element and at least one elastic element connecting two parts of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">This characteristic favours the deformation of the collar and as a consequence the passage from the convex configuration to the concave position, with the transition being achieved more rapidly on entry of the life jacket into the water.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the invention, the collar can be composed of one or more pockets, each of which can accommodate a buoyancy block.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the case of a collar that has at least two pockets, it is arranged that the connection between the pockets should allow relative angular movement of the pockets allowing the collar to assume a substantially rounded shape that hugs the shape of the neck and the lower head.</p>

<description-of-drawings>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This present invention will be understood more clearly on reading the description that follows of a preferred example of implementation, where this description is provided only by way of a non-limiting example, with reference to the appended drawings in which:</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically represents an example of implementation of a life jacket according to invention, placed flat,</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents a view in perspective of a life jacket placed on a model, the life jacket being in the rest position,</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents the life jacket shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, here placed in the safety position,</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a detail of the implementation of the life jacket.</p>
</description-of-drawings>
<?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring mainly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, we see a life jacket <b>1</b> that includes a collar <b>2</b> and a main body <b>3</b>. The main body <b>3</b> is attached to the collar <b>2</b> at the lateral extremities <b>4</b> of the said collar.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The life jacket <b>1</b> also includes positioning resources <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">These positioning resources <b>5</b> can be placed at different heights on the jacket <b>1</b>, and the term collar <b>2</b> refers, in the remainder of the application, to the part of the life jacket <b>1</b> that can pass from a down position to an up position, where this part can be of various dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In particular, as illustrated in the appended drawings, this collar can substantially constitute a half-collar. However, it is also possible to create life jackets with collars that surround the head of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">This collar <b>2</b> can be composed of one or more pockets <b>6</b>, where each pocket <b>6</b> accommodates a buoyancy block.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the method of implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, it can be seen that the collar <b>2</b> includes two pockets <b>6</b> attached to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Advantageously, the connection between the pockets <b>6</b> allows angular movement of the pockets <b>6</b> in relation to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Regarding the positioning resources <b>5</b>, we see particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that they include elastic tensioning resources <b>7</b> composed of an elastic strip, associated with a bellows or concertina element <b>8</b>. When the pressure of the water on the rear of the collar <b>2</b> is sufficiently high, these positioning resources <b>5</b> allow the deformation of the collar <b>2</b>, which passes from a convex position to a concave position, with this latter position providing back and side support for the person in the water.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In order to facilitate this deformation, it is also possible to arrange for additional tensioning resources <b>9</b>, where these tensioning resources <b>9</b> can be of reduced dimensions in relation to tensioning resources <b>7</b>, but of a similar structure and in particular can include a bellows or concertina element <b>10</b> and at least one elastic element <b>11</b> connecting the two parts of the main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Advantageously, the main body <b>3</b> includes two additional tensioning resources <b>9</b> placed in the vicinity of the tensioning resources <b>7</b> between the main body <b>3</b> and the collar <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the implementation example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the elastic tensioning resources <b>7</b> are placed between the main body <b>3</b> and the collar <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Advantageously, the elastic tensioning resources <b>7</b> are positioned at the lateral extremities <b>4</b> of the collar. Nevertheless it is also possible to arrange that these tensioning resources <b>7</b> could also be placed between different elements of the collar <b>2</b>, in particular when the latter is composed of several pockets <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">By now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, it can be seen that the positioning resources <b>5</b> include a hinge <b>12</b>, where this hinge <b>12</b> allows the collar <b>2</b> to pivot in relation to the main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thus, the elastic tensioning resources <b>7</b> allow a deformation of the collar <b>2</b> and the hinge <b>12</b>, so as to allow this collar <b>2</b> to pivot in relation to the main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Advantageously, this hinge <b>12</b> is composed of a collar <b>13</b> connected firstly to the main body <b>3</b>, and secondly connected by a strip of material <b>14</b> to the collar <b>2</b> or incorporated into this collar <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Advantageously, at the top, the collar <b>13</b> is of a substantially cylindrical configuration so that it can at least partially hug the neck of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, we see a life jacket <b>1</b> placed on a model which corresponds to the rest position of the life jacket, that is where the jacket has its collar <b>2</b> in the convex configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Under the effect of the pressure of the water, shown by the upward arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, on immersing the model, the collar will move away from the back of the wearer and deform, with this deformation being enabled by the elastic tensioning resources <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The collar <b>2</b> can then pivot into the up position, with the pivoting action being allowed by the hinge <b>12</b>, to take up the position represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Once a secure position has been established, the user can easily re-position the collar <b>2</b>, into the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, by holding the upper extremities of the collar <b>2</b> for example, and pulling backwards.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">We thus see how the structure of the life jacket <b>1</b> allows us to create a jacket <b>1</b> that is easy to operate and provides the user with characteristics of safety and comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to an advantageous characteristic of the invention, it is also arranged that the security aspect is further enhanced by fitting onto the collar <b>2</b>, elements that increase the visibility of the jacket, such as reflecting elements, which can include reflecting &#x201c;patches&#x201d; for example.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Naturally, other characteristics that are within the scope of the professional in this area can also be envisaged without moving outside the coverage of the invention as determined by the following claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to copending U.S. application Ser. No. 11/261,338, filed Oct. 28, 2005, entitled &#x201c;Imaging Members&#x201d;, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates, in various embodiments, to electrophotographic imaging members. The imaging members described herein can be used as photosensitive members, photoreceptors or photoconductors useful in electrophotographic systems, including printers, copiers, other reproductive devices, and digital apparatuses. More particularly, the imaging members of this disclosure do not require an anti-curl back coating to maintain flatness, etc., and comprise at least a flexible substrate and a layer comprising a charge transport material having certain characteristics. The disclosure also relates to methods of imaging utilizing such imaging members.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrophotographic imaging members, such as photoreceptors or photoconductors, typically include a photoconductive layer formed on an electrically conductive substrate or formed on layers between the substrate and photoconductive layer. The photoconductive layer is an insulator in the dark, so that during machine imaging processes, electric charges are retained on its surface. Upon exposure to light, the charge is dissipated, and an image can be formed thereon, developed using a developer material, transferred to a copy substrate, and fused thereto to form a copy or print. Electrophotographic imaging members are typically in either a flexible belt configuration or rigid drum form. Flexible imaging member belts may either be seamed or seamless belts. However, for reasons of simplicity, the disclosure hereinafter will focus only on electrophotographic imaging members in a flexible belt configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For typical negatively-charged flexible electrophotographic imaging member belts, the outermost exposed photoconductive layer is a charge transport layer. Therefore, under normal machine service conditions, the charge transport layer is repeatedly subjected to various machine subsystems mechanical interactions and constantly exposed to corona effluents (emitted from a charging device) and other volatile organic compound (VOC) species/contaminants. Mechanical interactions against imaging member cause the charge transport layer to develop wear, abrasion, and scratch. Wear reduces the charge transport layer thickness, effectively changing the charging field strength. Scratches manifest themselves as printout defects. Exposure to corona effluents and chemical contaminants gives rise to charge transport layer material degradation and lateral charge migration (LCM) problems. Charge transport layer material degradation facilitates the premature onset of layer cracking and LCM. All of these physical and mechanical failures impact copy image quality and cut short the intended functional life of an electrophotographic imaging member belt, requiring frequent and costly belt replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a service environment, a flexible imaging member belt, mounted on a belt supporting module, is exposed to repetitive electrophotographic image cycling which subjects the outer-most charge transport layer to mechanical fatigue as the imaging member belt bends and flexes over the belt drive roller and all other belt module support rollers, as well as sliding bend contact above each backer bar's curving surface. This repetitive imaging member belt cycling leads to a gradual deterioration in the physical and mechanical integrity of the exposed outer charge transport layer leading to premature onset of fatigue charge transport layer cracking. The cracks developed in the charge transport layer as a result of dynamic belt fatiguing manifest themselves as copy printout defects which adversely affect image quality. In essence, the appearance of charge transport cracking cuts short the imaging member belt's intended functional life.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many advanced imaging systems are based on the use of a flexible imaging member belt mounted over and around a belt support module design employing small diameter belt rollers. Although small diameter for belt module support rollers are used to provide easy paper self-stripping, the benefit of easy paper copy stripping negated by the large charge transport layer bending strain induced during dynamic fatigue belt flexing/bending motions over the small belt module support roller during image member belt machine functioning. The large bending strain induced by each small belt support module roller aggravates the mechanical problems that lead to early onset of charge transport layer cracking. Moreover, charge transport layer cracking frequently occurs at those belt segments parked over the support rollers during prolonged machine idling or overnight/weekend shut off periods as a result of exposure to residual corona effluents and airborne chemical contaminants. The early onset of charge transport layer cracking is a serious issue that impacts copy printout quality.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For typical negatively-charged imaging member belts, such as flexible photoreceptor belt designs, there are multiple layers comprised of a flexible supporting substrate, a conductive ground plane, a charge blocking layer, an optional adhesive layer, a charge generating layer, and an outermost exposed charge transport layer. The charge transport layer is usually the last layer to be coated and is applied by solution coating followed by drying at elevated temperatures, then cooling to ambient room temperature. When a production web stock of several thousand feet of coated multilayered photoreceptor material is obtained after finishing the charge transport layer coating and drying/cooling process, upward curling of the multilayered photoreceptor is observed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This upward curling has been determined to be the consequence of thermal contraction mismatch between the applied charge transport layer and the substrate support. Because the charge transport layer in a typical conventional photoreceptor device, using polycarbonate as binder, has a coefficient of thermal contraction approximately 3.7 times greater than that of the flexible substrate support (usually a polyethylene naphthalate or a polyethylene terephthalate), the charge transport layer has a greater dimensional contraction than that of the substrate support as it cools down to ambient room temperature. The resulting internal tension strain in the charge transport layer causes the photoreceptor to exhibit upward curling. If unrestrained, the photoreceptor would spontaneously curl upwardly such as into a 1.5-inch tube. To offset this curl and keep the photoreceptor web stock flat, an anti-curl back coating (ACBC) is applied to the backside of the flexible substrate support, opposite to the side having the charge transport layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Although an ACBC is required to keep the photoreceptor flat, its application represents more than just an additional coating step. It increases the labor and material cost and also decreases daily photoreceptor production through-put by about 25%. Moreover, the ACBC coating application frequently results in photoreceptor production yield lost due to web stock scratching damage caused by handling. In addition, the use of an ACBC has also been determined to cause an internal built-in strain of about 0.28% in the charge transport layer. This internal strain is cumulatively added onto each photoreceptor bending induced strain as the photoreceptor belt flexes over a variety of belt module support rollers during dynamic belt cycling function within a machine. Consequently, this internal built-in strain compounds and exacerbates the fatigue bending strain in the charge transport layer, causing early onset of charge transport layer cracking.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Seamed flexible photoreceptor belts are fabricated from sheets cut from an electrophotographic imaging member web stock having anti-curl back coating. The cut sheets are generally rectangular in shape. All edges may be of the same length or one pair of parallel edges may be longer than the other pair of parallel edges. The sheet is formed into a belt by joining the overlapping opposite marginal end regions of the sheet. A seam is typically produced in the overlapping opposite marginal end regions at the point of joining. Joining may be effected by means such as welding (including ultrasonic processes), gluing, taping, or pressure/heat fusing. However, ultrasonic seam welding is generally the preferred method of joining because it is rapid, clean (no application of solvents) and produces a thin and narrow seam. The ultrasonic seam welding process involves a mechanical pounding action of a welding horn which generates a sufficient amount of heat energy at the contiguous overlapping marginal end regions of the imaging member sheet to maximize melting of one or more layers therein. A typical ultrasonic welding process is carried out by pressing down the overlapping ends of the flexible imaging member sheet onto a flat anvil and guiding the flat end of the ultrasonic vibrating horn transversely across the width of the sheet and directly over the overlapped junction to form a welded seam having two adjacent seam splashings consisting of the molten mass of the imaging member layers ejected to either side of the welded overlapped seam.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These seam splashings of the ejected molten mass comprise about 40% by weight of the anti-curl back coating material. Seam splashings are undesirable projection features because they interfere with cleaning blade action, causing blade damage and wear which leads to premature loss of cleaning efficiency. The seam splashing present at the back side of the photoreceptor belt has also been found to physically interact with the belt support module roller, affecting the photoreceptor belt's delicate motion/cycling speed during an imaging process and impacting toner image formation as reflected in the copy printout quality.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another disadvantage of an ACBC is that the ACBC is in constant mechanical interaction with the machine belt support rollers and backer bars; this causes substantial wear of the ACBC. The ACBC may also be susceptible to degradation by ozone attack, which also accelerates wear. ACBC wear generates dust inside the machine cavity and reduces the thickness of the anti-curl layer, diminishing its ability to keep the photoreceptor belt flat. This upward belt curling, caused by loss of ACBC thickness, produces significant surface distance variation between the photoreceptor belt surface and the machine charging device; this variation causes non-uniform charging density over the photoreceptor belt surface, degrading copy printout quality.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, photoreceptor belt upward curling under dynamic belt functioning conditions causes the belt to physically interact/interfere with the xerographic subsystems, particularly in those machines employing a hybrid scavengeless development (HSD) or hybrid jumping development (HJD) subsystem. This interaction leads causes undesirable artifacts which manifest themselves as printout defects.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">With the noted undesirable traits described above, it is clear that flexible seamed photoreceptor belts which do not require an ACBC can reduce the belt unit manufacturing cost, increase belt yield and daily production throughput, provide extended service life, and suppress of early onset of charge transport layer cracking by eliminating internal strain.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,369 to R. Yu, issued on Feb. 18, 1992, the disclosure of which is fully incorporated herein by reference, an electrophotographic imaging member having a supporting substrate and a charge generating layer, the supporting substrate material having a thermal contraction coefficient which is about the same as that of the charge generating layer, is disclosed. Substrate materials that have a thermal contraction coefficient value from about 5.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>/&#xb0; C. to about 9.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>/&#xb0; C. are used in combination with a benzimidazole perylene charge generating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">U.S. Pat. No. 5,167,987 to R. Yu, issued on Dec. 1, 1992, discloses a process for fabricating an electrostatographic imaging member including providing a flexible substrate comprising a solid thermoplastic polymer, forming an imaging layer coating including a film forming polymer on the substrate, heating the coating and substrate, cooling the coating and substrate, and applying sufficient predetermined biaxial tensions to the substrate while the imaging layer coating and substrate are at a temperature greater than the Glass Transition Temperature (Tg) of the imaging layer coating to substantially compensate for all dimensional thermal contraction mismatches between the substrate and the imaging layer coating during cooling of the imaging layer coating and the substrate, removing application of the biaxial tensions to the substrate, and cooling the substrate whereby the final hardened and cooled imaging layer coating and substrate are free of internal stress and strain. The disclosure of the '987 patent is also fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">U.S. Pat. No. 4,983,481 to R. Yu, issued on Jan. 8, 1991, discloses an imaging member without an anti-curl backing layer having improved resistance to curling. The imaging member comprises a flexible supporting substrate layer, an electrically conductive layer, an optional adhesive layer, a charge generating layer, and a charge transport layer, the supporting substrate layer having a thermal contraction coefficient substantially identical to the thermal contraction coefficient of the charge transport layer. The supporting substrate may be a flexible biaxially oriented layer. The disclosure of this patent is further fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">While the above mentioned curl-free flexible imaging members having no ACBC may be useful for their intended purpose of resolving specific problems, resolution of one problem has often been found to create new ones. For example, the selection of a supporting substrate having thermal contraction matching that of the charge transport layer has been observed to be susceptible to attack and damage by solvents used in the charge transport layer coating solution, rendering the imaging member useless. Other substrate supports have good thermal contraction matching properties but also have inherently low glass transition temperatures (Tg) which are not suitable for imaging member fabrication. Applying biaxial tensioning stress onto imaging members maintained at a temperature slightly above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the charge transport layer is a costly and cumbersome batch process.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">There continues to be a need for improved imaging members, especially flexible imaging member belts, which do not have an ACBC, wherein the layer comprising the charge transport material has little or no internal built-in strain, is less susceptible to cracking induced by fatigue bending, and is less susceptible to material failure from exposure to corona effluents and airborne chemical contaminants.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A flexible imaging member which does not require the use of an anti-curl back coating is disclosed herein. The flexible imaging member has a layer comprising two charge transport molecules dispersed in a film-forming polymer binder. The first charge transport molecule is a biphenyl amine, terphenyl diamine, or bis(triarylamine) stilbene. The second charge transport molecule is a bis(triarylamine), tri-p-tolylamine, or triphenylamine. The weight ratio of second charge transport molecule to first charge transport molecule is from about 90:10 to about 66:34. Trifluoro acetic acid is also added to the layer containing the charge transport material.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The exemplary embodiments of this disclosure are more particularly described below with reference to the drawings. Although specific terms are used in the following description for clarity, these terms are intended to refer only to the particular structure of the various embodiments selected for illustration in the drawings and not to define or limit the scope of the disclosure. The same reference numerals are used to identify the same structure in different Figures unless specified otherwise. The structures in the Figures are not drawn according to their relative proportions and the drawings should not be interpreted as limiting the disclosure in size or location.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated a conventional electrophotographic flexible imaging member <b>10</b>, used for a negatively charging system, in the form of a sheet having a first end marginal region <b>12</b> overlapping a second end marginal region <b>14</b> to form an overlap region ready for a seam forming operation into a flexible belt. The flexible imaging member <b>10</b> can be utilized within an electrophotographic imaging member device and may be a member having a flexible substrate support layer combined with one or more additional coating layers. At least one of the coating layers comprises a film forming binder.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The flexible imaging member sheet <b>10</b> may comprise multiple layers. If the flexible imaging member sheet is a negatively charged photoreceptor device, the flexible imaging member sheet may comprise a charge generating layer sandwiched between an electrically conductive substrate surface layer (coated over the flexible substrate support layer) and a charge transport layer. Alternatively, the flexible member sheet may comprise a charge transport layer sandwiched between a conductive surface layer and a charge generating layer to give a positively charged photoreceptor device.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The layers of the flexible imaging member sheet <b>10</b> can comprise numerous coating layers containing materials of suitable mechanical properties. Examples of typical layers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,570, U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,117 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,021,309, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The cut sheet of flexible imaging member sheet <b>10</b> with overlapping ends shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, including the two end marginal regions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, comprises from top to bottom a charge transport layer <b>16</b>, a charge generating layer <b>18</b>, an interface layer <b>20</b>, a blocking layer <b>22</b>, an electrically conductive substrate surface layer <b>24</b>, a flexible supporting substrate layer <b>26</b>, and an anti-curl back coating layer <b>28</b> which maintains imaging member flatness.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The overlapping end marginal regions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can be joined by different means including ultrasonic welding, gluing, taping, stapling, and pressure and heat fusing to form a continuous imaging member seamed belt, sleeve, or cylinder. However, due to considerations such as ease of belt fabrication, short operation cycle time, and mechanical strength of the fabricated joint, the ultrasonic welding process is usually used to join the overlapping end marginal regions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> of flexible imaging member sheet <b>10</b> into a seam <b>30</b> in the overlapping region, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to form a seamed flexible electrophotographic imaging member belt. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the location of seam <b>30</b> is indicated by an encircling dotted line; the seam <b>30</b> comprises two vertical portions joined by a horizontal portion. The flexible electrophotographic imaging member sheet <b>10</b> is thus transformed from a cut sheet of imaging member material having desirable dimensions as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> into a continuous flexible electrophotographic imaging member seamed belt as pictorially represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The flexible imaging member seamed belt has a first major exterior or top surface <b>32</b> and a second major exterior or bottom surface <b>34</b> on the opposite side. The seam <b>30</b> joins the two overlapping ends of flexible imaging member sheet <b>10</b> so that the bottom surface <b>34</b> (generally including at least one layer immediately above) at and/or near the first end marginal region <b>12</b> is integral with the top surface <b>32</b> (generally including at least one layer immediately below) at and/or near the second end marginal region <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When an ultrasonic welding process is employed to transform the sheet of flexible electrophotographic imaging member material into an imaging member seamed belt, the seam of the belt is created by the high frequency mechanical pounding action of a welding horn over the overlapped opposite end regions of the imaging member sheet to cause material fusion. In the ultrasonic seam welding process, ultrasonic energy generated by the welding horn action, in the form of heat is applied to the overlap region to melt layers such as the charge transport layer <b>16</b>, charge generating layer <b>18</b>, interface layer <b>20</b>, blocking layer <b>22</b>, conductive layer <b>24</b>, a small part of the substrate support layer <b>26</b>, and the anti-curl back coating <b>28</b> as well. Therefore, direct material fusing at the interface between the contacting surfaces of the two overlapping ends of the substrate support layer provides best adhesion bonding to give highest seam rupture strength.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Upon completion of welding of the overlapping region of the imaging member sheet into a seam <b>30</b> with the ultrasonic seam welding techniques, the overlapping ends are converted into an abutting region shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Within the abutting region, the end marginal regions <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are joined by the seam <b>30</b> such that they abut one another. The welded seam <b>30</b> contains top and bottom splashings <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>; the splashings are formed by the process of joining the end marginal regions together. Molten mass of materials, consisting of all of the imaging member layers at inside domain of the overlapping ends, are necessarily ejected to either side of the overlap region as opposite ends am fused together; this causes the formation of two splashings <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> on either side of the welded seam <b>30</b>. The top splashing <b>68</b> is located above the overlapping end marginal region <b>14</b> abutting the top surface <b>32</b> and adjacent to and abutting the overlapping end marginal region <b>12</b>. The bottom splashing <b>70</b> is located below the overlapping end marginal region <b>12</b> abutting bottom surface <b>34</b> and adjacent to and abutting the overlapping end marginal region <b>14</b>. A typical seam splashing has a height or thickness t of about 80 micrometers above the bet surface. The seam splashings <b>66</b> and <b>70</b> may extend beyond the two imaging member belt edges or sides in the overlap region of the welded flexible imaging member seamed belt, they are therefore usually undesirable for many machines, such as electrophotographic copiers, duplicators and copiers, that require precise edge positioning of a flexible member seamed belt during machine operation. The bottom splashing <b>70</b> also interacts physically with the belt support rollers and the backer bars of the belt module it travels over, affecting the imaging member belt's delicate motion/transporting speed. The top splashing <b>68</b> with a rough surface morphology <b>74</b> can mechanically interfere with the cleaning blade's sliding action by nicking the blade and exacerbating blade wear, causing the cleaning blade's premature loss of cleaning efficiency during electrophotographic imaging member belt machine function. For these reasons, the splashing extensions are usually removed or notched out from the two bet edges with a puncher.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Large tension stresses will develop in the vicinity adjacent to the seam <b>30</b> due to the excessively large seam splashing size <b>68</b> and its material and geometrical discontinuity thereof. The detrimental effect of stress concentration compounded by the repeating cleaning blade striking/impact on the seam during imaging member belt cycling promotes the early development of a seam cracking/delamination failure site <b>80</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The failure site <b>80</b> acts as a deposit site for toner, paper fibers, dirt, debris and other unwanted materials during electrophotographic imaging and cleaning processes of the flexible imaging member seamed belt. For example, during the cleaning process, a cleaning instrument, such as a cleaning blade, will repeatedly pass over the failure site <b>80</b>. As the failure site <b>80</b> becomes filled with debris, the cleaning instrument may dislodge at least a portion of this highly concentrated level of debris. The amount of debris, however, is beyond the removal capacity of the cleaning instrument. Instead, portions of the highly concentrated debris are deposited onto the surface of the seamed belt. In effect, the cleaning instrument spreads the debris across the surface of the flexible imaging member seamed belt instead of removing the debris therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition to seam failure and debris spreading, the portion of the flexible imaging member seamed belt above the failure site <b>80</b> can act as a flap which moves upwardly. This flap can become an obstacle to the cleaning instrument as it travels across the surface of the seamed belt. When the cleaning instrument strikes the flap, great force is exerted on the cleaning instrument which can lead to damage, e.g., excessive wear, nicking, and tearing of the cleaning blade.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Besides damaging the cleaning blade, the striking of the flap by the cleaning instrument can cause unwanted vibration in the flexible imaging member seamed belt. This unwanted vibration adversely affects copy/print quality because imaging occurs on one part of the seamed belt simultaneously with the cleaning of another part of the seamed belt.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the flexible imaging member seamed belt bends over the exterior surfaces of the rollers of a belt module within an electrophotographic imaging apparatus, the bottom surface <b>34</b> of the flexible imaging member seamed belt is compressed while the top surface <b>32</b> is stretched under tension. Compression stresses, such as those at the bottom belt surface <b>34</b>, rarely cause seam failure. Tension stresses, such as that induced at the top belt surface <b>32</b>, however, are a more serious problem. Tension stress is the cause of charge transport layer cracking; additionally, such cracks may propagate throughout the other layers of the imaging member. These fatigue-induced cracks manifest themselves into copy printout defects. Consequently, the usefulness and service life of a flexible imaging member seamed belt is shortened from about 105,000 belt cycles for an imaging member belt of the present disclosure to about 47,000 belt cycles for a control imaging belt member when dynamically tested in an imaging machine utilizing a belt support module equipped with two 19 millimeter diameter rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Imaging members of the present disclosure may comprise a flexible supporting substrate <b>26</b>, a conductive layer <b>24</b>, an optional charge blocking layer <b>22</b>, an optional adhesive layer <b>20</b>, a charge generating layer <b>18</b>, a charge transport layer <b>16</b>, and an overcoat layer. However, the imaging member of the present disclosure does not contain an anti-curl back coating <b>28</b> of conventional prior art imaging member <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each layer of the imaging member is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The substrate may be opaque or substantially transparent and may comprise numerous suitable materials having the required mechanical properties. When the substrate material is an electrically non-conductive material, the substrate may further be provided with an electrically conductive layer; i.e. the electrically conductive layer may be optional. Accordingly, the substrate may comprise a layer of an electrically non-conductive or conductive material such as an inorganic or organic composition. As electrically non-conducting materials, there may be employed various resins known for this purpose including polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyurethanes, and the like. The electrically insulating or conductive substrate may be flexible, semi-rigid, or rigid, and may have any number of different configurations such as, for example, a sheet, a scroll, an endless flexible belt, a cylinder, and the like. The substrate may be in the form of an endless flexible belt which comprises a commercially available biaxially oriented polyester known as MYLAR&#x2122;, MELINEX&#x2122;, and KALADEX&#xae; available from E. I. du Pont de Nemours &#x26; Co.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The thickness of the substrate layer depends on numerous factors, including mechanical performance and economic considerations. The thickness of this layer, especially for a flexible imaging member belt, may range from about 50 micrometers to about 200 micrometers. The surface of the substrate layer is preferably cleaned prior to coating to promote greater adhesion of the deposited coating composition. Cleaning may be effected by, for example, exposing the surface of the substrate layer to plasma discharge, ion bombardment, and the like methods. However, in specific embodiments, the substrate has a thickness of from about 50 micrometers to about 125 micrometers, based on the considerations of optimum light energy transmission for effective back erase, adequate substrate flexibility, and cost impact. A substrate of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) is also effectively used in embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The conductive layer on the flexible substrate may vary in thickness over substantially wide ranges depending on the optical transparency and degree of flexibility desired for the electrophotographic member. Accordingly, for a flexible photoresponsive imaging device, the thickness of the conductive layer may be from about 20 angstrom units to about 750 angstrom units, and more preferably from about 100 Angstrom units to about 200 angstrom units for an optimum combination of electrical conductivity, flexibility and light transmission. The electrically conductive substrate surface layer may be an electrically conductive metal layer formed, for example, on the substrate by different coating technique, such as a vacuum depositing technique. Typical metals include aluminum, zirconium, niobium, tantalum, vanadium and hafnium, titanium, nickel, stainless steel, chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, and the like. Regardless of the technique employed to form the metal layer, a thin layer of metal oxide forms on the outer surface of most metals upon exposure to air. Thus, when other layers overlying the metal layer are characterized as &#x201c;contiguous&#x201d; layers, it is intended that these overlying contiguous layers may, in fact, contact a thin metal oxide layer that has formed on the outer surface of the oxidizable metal layer. In embodiments, for rear erase exposure, an electrically conductive substrate surface layer light transparency of at least about 15% is desirable. The electrically conductive substrate surface layer need not be limited to metals. Other examples of electrically conductive substrate surface layers may be combinations of materials such as conductive indium tin oxide as a transparent layer for light having a wavelength from about 4000 Angstroms to about 7000 Angstroms or a transparent copper iodide (CuI) or a conductive carbon black dispersed in a plastic binder as an opaque conductive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">An optional charge blocking layer may be applied to the electrically conductive substrate surface layer prior to or subsequent to application of the anti-curl backing layer to the opposite side of the substrate. Generally, electron blocking layers for positively charged photoreceptors allow holes from the imaging surface of the photoreceptor to migrate toward the conductive layer. Any blocking layer capable of forming an electronic barrier to holes between the adjacent photoconductive layer and the underlying conductive layer may be utilized. The blocking layer may be nitrogen containing siloxanes or nitrogen containing titanium compounds as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,338,387, U.S. Pat. No. 4,286,033 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,291,110, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In embodiments, a preferred blocking layer comprises a reaction product between a hydrolyzed silane and the oxidized surface of a metal ground plane layer. The blocking layer may be applied by different techniques such as spraying, dip coating, draw bar coating, gravure coating, silk screening, air knife coating, reverse roll coating, vacuum deposition, chemical treatment and the like. For convenience in obtaining thin layers, the blocking layers in embodiments are preferably applied in the form of a dilute solution, with the solvent being removed after deposition of the coating by techniques such as by vacuum, heating and the like. The blocking layer should be continuous and have a thickness of less than about 0.2 micrometer. A greater thickness may lead to undesirably high residual voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">An optional adhesive layer may be applied to the hole blocking layer. Typical adhesive layer materials include, for example, polyesters, DUPONT 49,000 (available from E. I.

In embodiments, satisfactory results may be achieved with an adhesive layer thickness from about 0.05 micrometer (500 Angstroms) to about 0.3 micrometer (3,000 Angstroms). Techniques for applying an adhesive layer coating mixture to the charge blocking layer include spraying, dip coating, roll coating, wire wound rod coating, gravure coating, bird applicator coating, and the like.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The combination of the given first and second charge transport molecules is critical. The first charge transport molecules have better photoelectrical properties than the second charge transport molecules. However, the first charge transport molecules also cause the charge transport layer to curl upward, whereas the second charge transport molecules do not. The second charge transport molecules reduce the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the charge transport layer more quickly on a weight basis than the first charge transport molecules. This is undesirable because a minimum Tg of at least 5&#xb0; C. above a xerographic machine operational temperature needs to be maintained or else the charge transport layer plasticizes and becomes unusable. Although the combination of first and second charge transport molecules is a critical factor to balancing the Tg of the charge transport layer and affect the outcome of imaging member flatness, the blending of these two types of charge transport molecules also minimizes the thermal contraction coefficient mismatch between the charge transport layer and the substrate support to reduce the internal strain from the charge transport layer of this disclosure. Therefore, the effect of Tg reduction complemented by minimizing the thermal contraction mismatch produces a synergy to render the resulting imaging member with flatness without the need of an anti-curl back coating.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">It has been found that as the weight ratio of second charge transport molecule to first charge transport molecule (second:first) increases in a charge transport layer, the degree of upward curling decreases and the Tg decreases as well. For example, when the charge transport layer contains only m-TBD, the photoreceptor will curl into a tube having a diameter of curvature of 1.5 inches. However, when the second:first ratio is 50:50 by weight, the tube has a diameter of curvature of 6.25 inches. When the second:first ratio is 66:34 by weight, the photoreceptor exhibits no upward curling and becomes flat. When the second:first ratio is 0:100 by weight (or no TTA, but m-TBD only), the Tg is 85&#xb0; C.; when the second:first ratio is 66:34 by weight, the Tg is 46&#xb0; C. In specific embodiments, the second:first weight ratio is from about 90:10 to about 55:45. In other specific embodiments, the second:first weight ratio is from about 90:10 to about 60:40. In more specific embodiments, the second:first weight ratio is from about 90:10 to about 66:34. The second:first weight ratio is critical to obtaining a photoreceptor which exhibits no upward curling and to obtaining a charge transport layer with a given Tg.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In specific embodiments, the weight ratio of second:first is selected so that the Tg is between from about 35&#xb0; C. to about 45&#xb0; C. This ensures that the resulting charge transport layer is free of built-in internal strain. Because the charge transport layer of the present disclosure has no internal strain, it eliminates charge transport layer cracking due to flexing and/or normal service conditions.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Conventional Example</heading>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">A prior art flexible electrophotographic imaging member web was prepared by providing a 0.02 micrometer thick titanium layer coated on a substrate of a biaxially oriented polyethylene naphthalate substrate (KADALEX, available from DuPont Teijin Films) having a thickness of 3.5 mils (89 micrometers). The titanized KADALEX substrate was extrusion coated with a blocking layer solution containing a mixture of 6.5 grams of gamma aminopropyltriethoxy silane, 39.4 grams of distilled water, 2.08 grams of acetic acid, 752.2 grams of 200 proof denatured alcohol and 200 grams of heptane. This wet coating layer was then allowed to dry for 5 minutes at 135&#xb0; C. in a forced air oven to remove the solvents from the coating and form a crosslinked silane blocking layer. The resulting blocking layer had an average dry thickness of 0.04 micrometers as measured with an ellipsometer.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">An adhesive interface layer was then extrusion coated by applying to the blocking layer a wet coating containing 5 percent by weight based on the total weight of the solution of polyester adhesive (MOR-ESTER 49,000, available from Morton International, Inc.) in a 70:30 (v/v) mixture of tetrahydrofuran/cyclohexanone. The resulting adhesive interface layer, after passing through an oven, had a dry thickness of 0.095 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The adhesive interface layer was thereafter coated over with a charge generating layer. The charge generating layer dispersion was prepared by adding 1.5 gram of polystyrene-co-4-vinyl pyridine and 44.33 gm of toluene into a 4 ounce glass bottle. 1.5 grams of hydroxygallium phthalocyanine Type V and 300 grams of &#x215b;-inch (3.2 millimeters) diameter stainless steel shot were added to the solution. This mixture was then placed on a ball mill for about 8 to about 20 hours. The resulting slurry was thereafter coated onto the adhesive interface by extrusion application process to form a layer having a wet thickness of 0.25 mils. However, a strip of about 10 millimeters wide along one edge of the substrate web stock bearing the blocking layer and the adhesive layer was deliberately left uncoated by the charge generating layer to facilitate adequate electrical contact by a ground strip layer to be applied later. The wet charge generating layer was dried at 125&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes in a forced air oven to form a dry charge generating layer having a thickness of 0.4 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">This coated web stock was simultaneously coated over with a charge transport layer and a ground strip layer by co-extrusion of the coating materials. The charge transport layer was prepared by combining MAKROLON&#xae; 5705, a Bisphenol A polycarbonate thermoplastic having a molecular weight of about 120,000, commercially available from Farbensabricken Bayer A.G., with m-TBD in an amber glass bottle in a weight ratio of 1:1 (or 50 weight percent of each).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The resulting mixture was dissolved to give 15 percent by weight solid in methylene chloride. This solution was applied on the charge generating layer by extrusion to form a coating which upon drying in a forced air oven gave a charge transport layer 29 micrometers thick.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The strip, about 10 millimeters wide, of the adhesive layer left uncoated by the charge generating layer, was coated with a ground strip layer during the co-extrusion process. The ground strip layer coating mixture was prepared by combining 23.81 grams of polycarbonate resin (MAKROLON&#xae; 5705, 7.87 percent by total weight solids, available from Bayer A.G.), and 332 grams of methylene chloride in a carboy container. The container was covered tightly and placed on a roll mill for about 24 hours until the polycarbonate was dissolved in the methylene chloride. The resulting solution was mixed for 15-30 minutes with about 93.89 grams of graphite dispersion (12.3 percent by weight solids) of 9.41 parts by weight of graphite, 2.87 parts by weight of ethyl cellulose and 87.7 parts by weight of solvent (Acheson Graphite dispersion RW22790, available from Acheson Colloids Company) with the aid of a high shear blade dispersed in a water cooled, jacketed container to prevent the dispersion from overheating and losing solvent. The resulting dispersion was then filtered and the viscosity was adjusted with the aid of methylene chloride. This ground strip layer coating mixture was then applied, by co-extrusion with the charge transport layer, to the electrophotographic imaging member web to form an electrically conductive ground strip layer having a dried thickness of about 19 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The imaging member web stock containing all of the above layers was then passed through 125&#xb0; C. in a forced air oven for 3 minutes to simultaneously dry both the charge transport layer and the ground strip. At this point, the imaging member, having a 29-micrometer thick dried charge transport layer, spontaneously exhibited upward curling into a 1.5-inch tube when unrestrained.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">An anti-curl coating was prepared by combining 88.2 grams of polycarbonate resin (MAKROLON&#xae; 5705), 7.12 grams VITEL PE-200 copolyester (available from Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company) and 1,071 grams of methylene chloride in a carboy container to form a coating solution containing 8.9 percent solids. The container was covered tightly and placed on a roll mill for about 24 hours until the polycarbonate and polyester were dissolved in the methylene chloride to form the anti-curl back coating solution. The anti-curl back coating solution was then applied to the rear surface (side opposite the charge generating layer and charge transport layer) of the electrophotographic imaging member web by extrusion coating and dried to a maximum temperature of 125&#xb0; C. in a forced air oven for 3 minutes to produce a dried anti-curl backing layer having a thickness of 17 micrometers and flatten the imaging member.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Control Example</heading>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">An electrophotographic imaging member web was prepared as in the Conventional Example, except the anti-curl back coating (ACBC) was not applied. The fabricated imaging member, as a rectangular cut sheet of 12&#x2033;&#xd7;12&#x2033; exhibited spontaneous upward curling into a 1.5-inch tube.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Disclosure Example I</heading>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Four electrophotographic imaging member webs were prepared as in the Control Example, except the charge transport layer was modified to contain various amounts of a second charge transport molecule, Tri-p-tolylamine (TTA). By keeping the ratio of total charge transport molecules to MAKROLON&#xae; 5705 at a constant of 50:50 weight ratio in the charge transport layer, the TTA replaced the m-TBD to give TTA:m-TBD weight ratios of 34:66, 50:50, 66:34, and 75:25 (Note that m-TBD represents the first charge transport molecule, while TTA represents the second charge transport molecule. Therefore, the TTA:m-TBD ratio is equivalent to the second:first ratio previously discussed.). The resulting imaging members (without an ACBC) were measured for the degree of upward curling as a function of the TTA content in the charge transport layer (CTL). The results thus obtained are listed in Table 1 below:</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The data showed that as the TTA:m-TBD weight ratio increased in the CTL, the degree of imaging member upward curling and the Tg both decreased. When the TTA:m-TBD weight ratio was 66:34, the imaging member had no upward curling and was absolutely flat. When the TTA:m-TBD weight ratio was 0:100 (or had no TTA present, same as that of the Control Example), the Tg was 85&#xb0; C.; when the TTA:m-TBD weight ratio was 66:34, the Tg was 46&#xb0; C. The observed reduction in the degree of curling was attributed to the combination of the effect of Tg reduction coupled with the decrease in thermal contraction mismatch between the CTL and the substrate support as a consequence of TTA incorporation into the CTL. The CTL of the curl-free imaging member of this disclosure, having no built-in internal strain, should therefore be more resistant to the fatigue bending CTL cracking problem under a normal imaging member belt cyclic functioning conditions in the field.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0001">This present application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/714,527, filed Sep. 14, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The invention relates to novel compounds that function as protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The family of 5-oxo-5,8-dihydro-pyrido-pyrimidines has exhibited promising pharmaceutical properties in the past; U.S. Pat. No. 4,556,709, JP 09221424 and DE 19532235 are indicative of recent investigations. More particularly, the invention relates to novel compounds that function as inhibitors of c-fms kinase.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">c-Fms is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase selectively expressed on macrophages and their progenitors. The extracellular Ig domain of c-fms binds macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), also known as colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). Binding of CSF-1 induces receptor dimerization and trans-phosphorylation of the intracellular c-fms kinase domain on Y723 and other tyrosine residues. Once phosphorylated, c-fms efficiently phosphorylates several cytoplasmic signaling molecules that lead to de novo gene expression and proliferation. Small molecule inhibitors of the kinase catalytic site of c-fms are expected to prevent CSF-1 induced cellular responses.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Macrophages are a predominant source of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the destructive pannus of rheumatoid arthritis. TNF and IL-1 activate stromal expression of hematopoietic factors including CSF-1. In turn, CSF-1 recruits monocytes and promotes macrophage survival, functional activation, and in some settings, proliferation. Thus, TNF and CSF-1 interact in a perpetuating cycle that leads to inflammation and joint destruction. The exclusive receptor for CSF-1 is c-fms, and the disclosed invention is a c-fms inhibitor designed to interrupt this cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Macrophages are abundant at sites of chronic inflammation where they are often the most important source of TNF, IL-1, and other cytokines. Moreover, macrophages can be an important source of factors that function in tissue remodeling such as plasminogen activators, matrix metalloproteases, vascular endothelial growth factor, and transforming growth factor-&#x3b2;. The numbers of macrophages present within target tissues have strongly correlated with disease severity in rheumatoid arthritis (Ann Rheum Dis 53 (1994) pp 39-44), immune nephritis (Kidney Int 54 (1998) pp 143-151), and graft rejection (Transpl Int 7 Suppl 1 (1994) pp 577-579). Macrophage numbers are also elevated in atherosclerotic plaque (Arch Pathol Lab Med 109 (1985) pp 445-449), adipose tissue in obesity (J Clin Invest 112 (2003) pp 1796-1898), diabetic nephropathy (Kidney Int 65 (2004) pp 116-128), cardiac hypertrophy (Hypertension 25 (1999) pp 132-138), and in many solid tumors (Trends in Immunology 23 (2002) pp 549-555), particularly breast cancer (J. Experimental Medicine 193 (2001) pp 727-739), where they are thought to contribute to disease progression. Modulation of macrophage function through inhibition of c-fms thus is expected to be useful in treating inflammatory mediated diseases and conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Another example of the invention is the use of any of the compounds described herein in the preparation of a medicament for treating: rheumatoid arthritis, graft rejection, atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetic nephropathy, cardiac hypertrophy and solid tumor diseases, especially breast cancer, in a subject in need of such treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">Preclinical data suggest CSF-1/FMS is a particularly viable therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis. Recent work has shown that neutralizing antibodies to CSF-1 reduce substantially the severity of collagen-induced arthritis in mice (J Leukoc Biol 68 (2000) pp 144-150). The authors additionally demonstrated that recombinant CSF-1 exacerbated the disease progress in this model. Therefore, a preferred use for the invention is the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0340">The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by methods known to those who are skilled in the art. The following reaction schemes are only meant to represent examples of the invention and are in no way meant to limit the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0341">The following general reaction schemes display various methods of reaching the compounds of Formula I. It is recognized by those skilled in the art that some compounds of Formula I may be further derivatized to provide additional embodiments of the invention. Representative further derivatizations appear in schemes I, II, and V.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0342">A typical preparation of compounds of the present invention is shown in Scheme I, wherein Ph is phenyl, which may be optionally further substituted with R<sup>101</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0343">An amine was reacted with ethyl 3-chloropropionate at elevated temperature at the presence of an inorganic base and a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium bromide to afford the aminopropionate ester 1-1.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0344">The amine was reacted with ethyl 4-chloro-2-methylthio-5-pyrimidinecarboxylate to produce the corresponding 4-substituted aminopyrimidine 1-2. Cyclization of this diester under Dieckmann conditions afforded the bicyclic compound 1-3.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0345">Subsequent halogenation with bromine followed by dehydrohalogenation gave the unsaturated 1-4 (Eur J Med Chem 9 (2000) pp 585-590). The methylthio group was oxidized to the sulfone 1-5, which was subsequently replaced with an amine by nucleophilic substitution.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0346">The resulting carboxylic ester 1-6 was converted to the carboxylic acid 1-7 via basic hydrolysis. Decarboxylation to give 1-8 occurred when the carboxylic acid was heated in DMSO in the presence of sodium cyanide (Tet Lett 35 (1994) pp 8303-8306).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0347">The carboxylic acid 1-7 was reacted with an amine under normal coupling conditions to form the corresponding amide 1-9. The amide 1-9 could also be prepared directly from the ester 1-6 when the amine R<sub>1</sub>&#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>was ammonia, or an alkylamine.</p>

The solvent was evaporated under vacuum to give a brown solid (&#x2dc;3 g), which was taken in 50 mL of acetic acid. To the stirring solution was added 20 mL of hydrogen peroxide (30% in water). The resulting yellow solution was stirred at r.t. overnight. Water (50 mL) was added and the solvent was evaporated in vacuum with minimal heating. The yellow residue was dried on high vacuum for two days. Then it was suspended in thionyl chloride (18 mL) and the mixture was heated to reflux (80&#xb0; C.) for 6 hours. The volatiles were evaporated to leave a yellow solid, which was used for next step without purification.</p>

<p id="p-0367" num="0609">An autophosphorylation, fluorescence polarization competition immunoassay was used to determine the potency for c-fms inhibition exhibited by selected compounds of Formula I. The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (LJL BioSystems). The assay buffer used was 100 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine 1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.5, 1 mM 1,4-dithio-DL-threitol (DTT), 0.01% (v/v) Tween-20. Compounds were diluted in assay buffer containing 4% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) just prior to the assay. To each well, 5 &#x3bc;L of compound were added followed by the addition of 3 &#x3bc;L of a mix containing 33 nM c-fms and 16.7 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(Sigma) in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 2 &#x3bc;L of 5 mM ATP (Sigma) in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the assay were 10 nM c-fms, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2% DMSO. Control reactions were ran in each plate: in positive and negative control wells, assay buffer (made 4% in DMSO) was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 &#x3bc;L of 50 mM ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid (EDTA).</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0610">The plates were incubated at room temperature for 45 min. At the end of the incubation, the reaction was quenched with 1.2 &#x3bc;L of 50 mM EDTA (EDTA was not added to the positive control wells at this point; see above). Following a 5-min incubation, each well received 10 &#x3bc;L of a 1:1:3 mixture of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 10&#xd7;, PTK green tracer, 10&#xd7; (vortexed), FP dilution buffer, respectively (all from PanVera, cat. # P2837). The plate was covered, incubated for 30 min at room temperature and the fluorescence polarization was read on the Analyst. The instrument settings were: 485 nm excitation filter; 530 nm emission filter; Z height: middle of well; G factor: 0.93. Under these conditions, the fluorescence polarization values for positive and negative controls were approximately 300 and 150, respectively, and were used to define the 100% and 0% inhibition of the c-fms reaction.</p>

<p id="h-0292" num="0000">Peptide (Non-Phosphorylated) Assay</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0613">A fluorescence polarization competition immunoassay was used to measure compound inhibition of CSF-1R phosphorylation of tyrosine on a synthetic CSF-1R<sub>555-568 </sub>peptide (SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ). The assay was performed in black 96-well microplates (Cat # 42-000-0117, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). To each well, 5 &#x3bc;L of compound (in 4% DMSO) were mixed with 2 &#x3bc;L of 3.5 nM CSF-1R, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20), and 2 &#x3bc;L of 1540 &#x3bc;M peptide in assay buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 1 &#x3bc;L of 10 mM ATP in assay buffer. The final concentrations in the 10 &#x3bc;L reaction mixture were 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 2% DMSO, 308 &#x3bc;M SYEGNSYTFIDPTQ, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.7 nM CSF-1R. Positive and negative control wells were included on each plate, where 4% DMSO in assay buffer was substituted for the compound; in addition, positive control wells received 1.2 &#x3bc;L of 50 mM EDTA before the start of the reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0614">The plates were covered and incubated at room temperature for 80 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of 1.2 &#x3bc;L of 50 mM EDTA. Each well then received 10 &#x3bc;L of a 1:1:3 mixture of 10&#xd7; anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 10&#xd7;PTK green tracer, and FP dilution buffer, respectively (Cat. # P2837, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The plates were covered, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the fluorescence polarization was read on an Analyst plate reader (Molecular Devices). Instrument settings were: 485 nm excitation, 530 nm emission, with a 505 nm cut-off filter; Z height: middle of well; G factor: 0.93. Under these conditions, the fluorescence polarization values for positive and negative controls were approximately 290 and 160, respectively, and were used to define 100% and 0% inhibition of the CSF-1R reaction.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to telechelic polymers having azlactone or ring-opened azlactone terminal groups.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The chemistry of acetoacetate compounds, and the Michael addition to acrylates has been described. For example, Mozner and Rheinberger reported the Michael addition of acetoacetates having a &#x3b2;-dicarbonyl group to triacrylates and tetracrylates to form gel products. See Macromolecular Rapid Communications 16 135-138 (1995).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,025,410 notes that the stoichiometry of the Michael donor to the Michael acceptor is critical to controlling the molecular weight. The reference teaches that certain soluble liquid uncrosslinked oligomers, made by one step Michael addition of acetoacetates to multi-acrylates, can be further crosslinked using ultraviolet light without using photoinitiators. If proportions below the claimed ranges are used, crosslinked gels or solid products are made which are not useful because only un-gelled, uncrosslinked liquid oligomers will further crosslink without adding photoinitiators. The described liquid oligomer compositions, since they are liquids, can readily be applied to various substrates using conventional coating techniques such as roll or spray prior to ultraviolet light cure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,367 describes NCO-free resins and cured products thereof. The cured products are obtained by a Michael reaction of an acetoacetylated (meth)acrylic resin or an acetoacetylated polyester and an NCO-free polyurethane having at least two (meth)acrylic end groups. U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,367 however does not teach the use of these products in electrical applications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP 227454 discloses a process for preparing a cured polymer involving the Michael reaction of an acetoacetylated polyol and a poly &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-unsaturated ester. The obtained cured products are said to exhibit excellent adhesion, excellent solvent resistance, excellent gloss retention, good flexibility and hardness.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,178 describes mixtures comprising an acetoacetate ester, an &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-ethylenically unsaturated monomer and a liquid tertiary amine catalyst. A cured system is obtained by reacting these components. The acetoacetate ester used is prepared by transesterification of polyhydroxyl compound having an average of at least two hydroxy groups with an alkylacetoacetate.</p>

No. 4,871,822 discloses a Michael reaction of olefinically unsaturated compounds with compounds containing at least two active hydrogen atoms for 2 component lacquers. As olefinically unsaturated compounds there are considered compounds having at least two &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-unsaturated carbonyl groups. There are a large number of Michael donors including acetoacetylated polyols or polyamines and such compounds as e.g. acetylacetone or benzoylacetone.</p>

Trumbo in Polymer Bulletin 26, pages 265-270 (1991) discloses Michael addition polymers obtained from 1,4- and 1,3-benzenedimethanol diacetoacetates and tripropylene glycol diacrylate. The reference describes that in case the reactants are used in stoichiometric amounts of the reactive groups, gelation of the system is observed. In another paper (Polymer Bulletin 26, pages 481-485 (1991)) the same author described Michael addition polymers obtained from the reaction of a bis(acetoacetyl) amide or an aliphatic acetoacetate and a di-acrylate comonomer. However, no utilisation or properties of the polymers are described in these articles.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides a curable composition comprising a Michael donor component, a polyacryl component, and 1) an ethylenically unsaturated monomer having a reactive azlactone functional group, or 2) an ethylenically unsaturated monomer having a reactive ring-opened azlactone functional group. In another aspect, the invention provides a telechelic polymer that is the reaction product of these components.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, the invention provides a method for preparing a telechelic polymer of controlled molecular weight by reacting a Michael donor component, a polyacryl component, and 1) an ethylenically unsaturated monomer having a reactive azlactone functional group, or 2) an ethylenically unsaturated monomer having a reactive ring-opened azlactone functional group. The invention overcomes the problems in the art by using a mono-ethylenically unsaturated monomer to regulate and control the molecular weight of the resulting polymers and to render the polymer telechelic. Thus the product polymer has at least one terminal group that may be used for further functionalization.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, curable compositions according to the present invention are coated on a substrate and at least partially polymerized to form a protective coating. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a composite article comprising a substrate having thereon a coating preparable by at least partially polymerizing the curable composition.</p>

wherein

R<sup>1 </sup>represents hydrogen, an alkyl group or an aryl group;
<br/>
W<sup>1 </sup>and W<sup>2 </sup>each independently selected from a cyano group, a nitro group, an alkyl carbonyl group, an alkoxy carbonyl group, an aryl carbonyl group, an aryloxy carbonyl group, an amido group, a sulphonyl group;

P represents a mono- or multi-valent organic residue, or the reaction residue of a polyol or polyamine in an acetoacetylation reaction, and

</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One useful class of Michael donors according to formula (I) are acetoacetylated polyols, which may be represented by Formula I where P is the residue of a polyol. The acetoacetylated polyol can be prepared by transesterification with an alkyl acetoacetate. A preferred transesterification reagent for this purpose is tert-butyl acetoacetate described by J. S. Witzeman and W. D. Nottingham in J. Org. Chem., 1991, (56), pp. 1713-1718. The polyols being acetoacetylated in this invention preferably have two or more hydroxy groups. The conversion of hydroxy groups to acetoacetate groups should be between 80 mol % and 100 mol % and more preferably between 85 mol % and 100%. Suitable acetoacetylated polyols are, for example, those obtained from one of the following polyols: polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polybutylene glycol, pentaerythritol, trimethylolethane, trimethylol propane, bis-trimethylol propane, K 55&#x2122; (available from Bayer AG) which is a condensation product of trimethylolpropane and propyleneoxide, dipentaerythritol, castor oil, glycerine, dipropyleneglycol, N,N,N&#x2032;N&#x2032;-tetrakis(2-hydroxypropyl)ethylendiamine, neopentylglycol, propanediol, butanediol, diethyleneglycol and the like. One or more of the hydroxyl end groups of such polyols may be acetoacetylated. In some embodiments it may be advantageous to acetoacetylate one end group, and to functionalize the other groups with an ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable group, such as an allyl group, a vinyl group or a (meth)acrylate group.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Where a hydrophilic telechelic polymer is desired, a acetoacetylated poly(alkylene oxide) may be used. The functional groups terminating the poly(alkylene oxide) may include hydroxy groups, and amine groups, which may be acetoacetylated as previously described. Poly(ethylene oxide), poly(propylene oxide), poly(ethylene oxide-propylene oxide), and combinations thereof may be acetoacetylated at one or both terminal ends.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Lower functionalised acetoacetylated polyols allow a more selective and better control of cross-linking than higher functionalised acetoacetylated polyols. Preferably, an acetoacetylated polyol in connection with this invention has an equivalent weight of less than 200 g/mol. A preferred range of equivalent weight of an acetoacetylated polyol in connection with this invention is between 30 g/mol and 5000 g/mol.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Examples of Michael donors according to formula (II) are e.g. compounds of the type p-CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;SO<sub>2</sub>NHCO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;P&#x2032; wherein P&#x2032; represents the residue of a polyol such as e.g. pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane, 1,6-hexanediol, ditrimethylolpropane, propanediol, diethyleneglycole and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Examples of compounds according to formula (III) are NC&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CN, CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CN, CF<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CF<sub>3</sub>, CF<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, p-CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;SO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, (CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>, p-O<sub>2</sub>NC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CN, and the like. Further examples may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,256,473.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With respect to Formulas I, II, and III, any of P, W<sup>1 </sup>or W<sup>2 </sup>may be further substituted with an ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable group, such as a methacryl group, a vinyl groups or an allyl group.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">There is a differential reactivity between acryl and methacryl groups with respect to Michael-type addition. Michael-type addition typically occurs easily with acryl groups (e.g., mere combination of a reactive fluorinated polyether with a compound having an acryl group, optionally with mild heating, typically, although not necessarily, results in spontaneous Michael-type addition), but may occur only with difficulty if at all, in the case of methacryl groups. For this reason, the polyacryl component typically has at least two acryl group (e.g., as part of acryloxy or acrylamido functionality), although the poly(meth)acryl compound may also have additional (meth)acryl groups (e.g., as part of methacrylate or methacrylamido functionality). Advantageously, composition may be prepared in which Michael addition occurs through the acryl groups, leaving methacyl groups unreacted. Such unreacted methacryl groups may be subsequently free-radically polymerized.</p>

For example, a compound of formula I such as methylacetoacetate has two protons alpha to both of the carbonyl groups, and so can react with two acryl groups. Thus methylacetoacetate has two functional group equivalents. In general, the ratio of Michael donor functional group equivalents (&#x201c;donor equivalents&#x201d;) to Michael acceptor functional group equivalents (&#x201c;acceptor equivalents&#x201d;) is less than 2:1, more preferably less than 1.5:1 and most preferably less than 1.1:1.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0082">The amount of unsaturated monomer having an azlactone (or ring-opened azlactone) reactive functional group is generally less than or equal to the difference between the amount of Michael donor functional group equivalents to Michael acceptor functional group equivalents. Most preferably, donor equivalents&#x2267;acceptor equivalents+azlactone monomer. For example where the ratio of donor equivalents to acceptor equivalents is less than 2:1, the amount of azlactone monomer is 2 equivalents or less. Where the ratio of donor equivalents to acceptor equivalents is less than 1.5:1, the amount of azlactone monomer is 1 equivalent or less. Where the ratio of donor equivalents to acceptor equivalents is less than 1.1:1, the amount of azlactone monomer is 0.2 equivalents or less.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0086">More complex structures where the donor or acceptor component have a functional equivalent of more than two may also be produced and are within the scope of the invention.

<p id="p-0088" num="0098">Curable compositions according to the present invention may be coated on a substrate and at least partially cured to provide a composite article. Suitable substrates include, for example, glass (e.g., windows and optical elements such as, for example, lenses and mirrors), ceramic (e.g., ceramic tile), cement, stone, painted surfaces (e.g., automobile body panels, boat surfaces), metal (e.g., architectural columns), paper (e.g., adhesive release liners), cardboard (e.g., food containers), thermosets, thermoplastics (e.g., polycarbonate, acrylics, polyolefins, polyurethanes, polyesters, polyamides, polyimides, phenolic resins, cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, polystyrene, and styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers), and combinations thereof. The substrate may be a film, sheet, or it may have some other form.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0099">The curable composition may be applied to the substrate by conventional techniques such as, for example, spraying, knife coating, notch coating, reverse roll coating, gravure coating, dip coating, bar coating, flood coating, or spin coating. Typically, the curable composition is applied to the substrate as a relatively thin layer resulting in a dried cured layer having a thickness in a range of from about 40 nm to about 60 nm, although thinner and thicker (e.g., having a thickness up to 100 micrometers or more) layers may also be used. Next, any optional solvent is typically at least partially removed (e.g., using a forced air oven), and the polymerizable composition is then at least partially polymerized (i.e., cured) to form a durable coating, for example, as described hereinabove.</p>

<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">This invention relates to a method for selecting a polyolefin having a die swell within a pre-selected range, the method comprising (a) obtaining from reference samples of a plurality of polyolefin batches a data set for at least one property, other than die swell, of the polyolefin; (b) obtaining a die swell data set from the reference samples of the polyolefin; (c) correlating the at least one property and the die swell data set using a regression analysis to generate an equation for predicting the die swell as a function of the at least one property from step (a); (d) obtaining from a non-reference polyolefin sample a value for each variable in the equation from step (c) and calculating the predicted die swell from the equation from step (c); (e) comparing the predicted die swell of step (d) to the die swell within the pre-selected range, and (f) rejecting the non-reference polyolefin when the predicted die swell for the non-reference polyolefin is outside of the pre-selected range of the die swell. This invention relates to the use of the method in the production of blow-molded articles and in the control of a polyolefin reactor process.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a method of identifying and selecting a polyolefin based on rheological measurements and controlling a polyolefin producing process based on the rheological measurements.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Currently a manufacturer of polyolefins, such as polyethylene, may test die swell characteristics of the polyolefin by producing a blow-molded product, such as a bottle, and then measuring the die swell. For example, the swell properties of a dairy grade polyethylene blow-molded bottle is measured by using a Uniloy blow-molding apparatus to prepare a bottle and then measuring the tab width, i.e., the flashing at the bottom of the bottle. The term &#x201c;tab width&#x201d; is synonymous with &#x201c;die swell.&#x201d; The processability of the polyolefin, as indicated by the swell analysis, is an important predictor of bottle quality. A polyolefin with too little swell will not properly fill the extremities of a mold, such as the handle of a bottle. A polyolefin with too much swell may form a molded article having flash in non-pinch-off areas and/or neck/tail flash which is difficult to trim. It is desirable to control swell in blow molding processes within acceptable limits.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Present methods of testing blow-molded articles, such as bottles, require large amounts, as much as 200 pounds, of polyolefin per batch and are labor intensive, time consuming and costly. There exists a need for a method of predicting die swell that reduces the labor, time, cost and amount of polyolefin tested per batch of polyolefin. There exists a need for a method of predicting, from one or more properties of the polyolefin, die swell of a polyolefin in a timely manner to permit modification of a polyolefin producing process to control the die swell of the polyolefin. There exists a need for a method of identifying and selecting polyolefins having predicted die swell within pre-selected ranges wherein the predicted die swell is based on rheological properties, other than die swell, of the polyolefin.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Applicants have developed a method of predicting die swell of a polyolefin from one or more properties of the polyolefin, a method for selecting a polyolefin having a predetermined die swell, a method for manufacturing a blow-molded article having a predicted die swell, and a method for modification of a polyolefin producing process to control the die swell of the polyolefin. The terms &#x201c;pre-selected range&#x201d; or &#x201c;control value&#x201d; used in reference to die swell typically refer to die swell values taken from a product manufacturing specification or product sales specification, which may be different for different polyolefins or different grades of the same polyolefin.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, this invention relates to a method for selecting a polyolefin having a predicted die swell within a pre-selected range comprising (a) obtaining, from reference samples of a plurality of polyolefin batches, a data set for at least one property, other than die swell, of the polyolefin; (b) obtaining a die swell data set from the reference samples of the polyolefin; (c) correlating the at least one property and the die swell data set using a regression analysis to generate an equation for predicting the die swell as a function of the at least one property from step (a); (d) obtaining, from a non-reference polyolefin sample, a value for each variable in the equation from step (c) and calculating the predicted die swell from the equation from step (c); (e) comparing the predicted die swell of step (d) to the die swell within the pre-selected range, and (f) rejecting the non-reference polyolefin when the predicted die swell for the non-reference polyolefin is outside of the pre-selected range of the die swell.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">This method of predicting die swell permits the identification and selection of a polyolefin batch that will have an acceptable die swell for a die having a slit of a given width.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The regression analysis used in any embodiment according to the present invention includes all conventional regression analysis methods. The regression analysis method includes, but is not limited to, partial least squares calculations. Unless otherwise noted, all partial least squares calculations were performed using the program MINITAB&#x2122; Release 13.32 sold by MINITAB, Inc. All embodiments according to the present invention may optionally include a computer system for acquiring data and/or storing data used in the regression analysis and for performing the regression analysis calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment according to the present invention, the polyolefin comprises a polyethylene homopolymer, a polyethylene copolymer, a polypropylene homopolymer or a polypropylene copolymer. In another embodiment, the polyolefin is selected from a dairy grade polyethylene, a household industrial chemical grade polyethylene and a high load melt index polyethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The reference samples are a population of samples for a polyolefin composition that encompasses the variation of properties typically found in the polyolefin produced over an extended period of time. For example, typical process variation for a polyolefin may result in a die swell ranging from about 6.08 inches to about 6.24 inches for samples produced at different times. The non-reference polyolefin is any sample from a batch of polyolefin of the same formulation as the reference samples, but that was not included in the reference samples. If the composition of the reference samples is altered or if the production conditions are altered, a new set of references samples may be obtained and tested to determine whether the properties of the polyolefin have changed sufficiently to require that a regression analysis be conducted to generate a new correlation equation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Typically, a data set of one or more properties was obtained from a set of reference samples by the test methods described below. Oscillation disk rheology (ODR) may be used to obtain data, such as tangent delta (hereafter &#x201c;tan (delta)&#x201d;), crossover frequency, and crossover point using, for example, an RDA III rheometer. In all embodiments the reference samples and non-reference samples may be in the form of a powder or a pellet. The properties from which the data sets may be constructed include, but are not limited to, tan (delta), melt index, polydispersity index, crossover frequency and crossover point. The tan (delta) data may be acquired at a single temperature or at multiple temperatures, for example 150&#xb0; C. and 155&#xb0; C. Tan (delta) data are typically acquired at temperatures ranging from about 145&#xb0; C. to about 155&#xb0; C. Tan (delta) is the ratio of loss modulus divided by storage modulus. Die swell data, typically Uniloy tab width data, is obtained from the same set of reference samples. The total sample size required for testing each property, such as tan (delta) and melt index, is typically about 1 gram, rather than multi-pound samples required by conventional blow molding test methods. The total time involved for test sample preparation and testing for the other properties is also generally much less than the time needed to prepare and test a blow-molded article.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, once the data sets of one or more properties and the die swell for a set of reference samples were obtained, the die swell data was correlated to one or more of the properties using a partial least squares calculation to produce an equation describing a model for predicting die swell from measurements of properties of the polyolefin. The equation describing the model for predicting die swell has one variable for each type of data included in the partial least squares calculation. The partial least squares calculation may be performed by any conventional method, one example of which is MINITAB&#x2122; Release 13.32 sold by MINITAB, Inc, for all embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment according to the present invention the tan (delta) at 150&#xb0; C. data for the pellet samples were correlated to the Uniloy tab width data for the same samples using a partial least squares calculation. In one embodiment according to the present invention both the tan (delta) at 150&#xb0; C. data and the tan (delta) at 155&#xb0; C. data for the pellet samples were correlated to the Uniloy tab width data for the same samples using a partial least squares calculation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment according to the present invention the tan (delta) at 150&#xb0; C. data, the tan (delta) at 155&#xb0; C. data and the melt index data for the pellet samples were correlated to the Uniloy tab width data for the same samples using a partial least squares calculation in MINITAB&#x2122; to generate the following Equation 1, having a variable for each property data set included in the partial least squares calculation, as a model for predicting die swell:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Predicted die swell=(24*Tan (delta) at 155&#xb0; C.)+(2.225*Melt Index)&#x2212;(22.46*Tan (delta) at 150&#xb0; C.)+0.7959&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Once the predicted die swell equation has been calculated for a given polyolefin formulation, a non-reference sample of polyolefin was tested for each property in the predicted die swell equation. The predicted die swell value for the particular batch of polyolefin was calculated from the predicted die swell equation. For example, in Equation 1 the tan (delta) at 150&#xb0; C., tan (delta) at 155&#xb0; C. and the melt index are measured for a non-reference polyolefin sample. The values for the tan (delta) at 150&#xb0; C., tan (delta) at 155&#xb0; C. and the melt index are inserted into Equation 1 and a predicted swell value for the polyolefin is calculated. This sampling, testing and calculation, after the equation has been generated, are typically completed in less than two hours. In contrast, sampling and preparation of blow-molded bottles and measurement of the Uniloy tab width may take up to eight hours.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another embodiment according to the present invention the tan (delta) at 150&#xb0; C. data for powder samples were correlated to the Uniloy tab width data for the same samples using a partial least squares calculation. In another embodiment according to the present invention, the tan (delta) at 150&#xb0; C. data and the tan (delta) at 155&#xb0; C. data were correlated to the Uniloy swell data for powder samples by a partial least squares calculation. In another embodiment according to the present invention the tan (delta) at 150&#xb0; C. data, the tan (delta) at 155&#xb0; C. data, and the melt index data for powder samples were correlated to the Uniloy tab width data for the same samples using a partial least squares calculation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, this invention relates to a method for manufacturing a blow-molded article having a predicted die swell within a pre-selected range comprising (a) obtaining, from reference samples of a plurality of polyolefin batches, a data set for at least one property, other than die swell, of the polyolefin; (b) obtaining a die swell data set from the reference samples of the polyolefin; (c) correlating the at least one property and the die swell data set using a regression analysis to generate an equation for predicting the die swell as a function of the at least one property from step (a); (d) obtaining from a non-reference polyolefin sample a value for each variable in the equation from step (c) and calculating the predicted die swell from the equation from step (c); (e) comparing the predicted die swell of step (d) to the die swell within the pre-selected range, and (f) blow-molding the polyolefin sample, having the predicted die swell within the pre-selected range, to form the blow-molded article.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment, this invention relates to a method of controlling a polyolefin reactor comprising (a) obtaining from reference samples of a plurality of polyolefin batches a data set for at least one property, other than die swell, of the polyolefin; (b) obtaining a die swell data set from the reference samples of the polyolefin; (c) correlating the at least one property and the die swell data set using a regression analysis to generate an equation for predicting the die swell as a function of the at least one property from step (a); (d) obtaining from a non-reference polyolefin sample a value for each variable in the equation from step (c) and calculating the predicted die swell from the equation from step (c); (e) comparing the predicted die swell of step (d) a control value for die swell; and (f) modifying at least one reactor condition to reduce a difference between the control value and the predicted die swell for the polyolefin sample from the reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, steps (a) through (f) are conducted as described above. Step (f) changes the current predicted swell value by modifying a condition in the reactor selected from temperature, olefin concentration, hydrogen concentration or a combination of the conditions in the reactor. For example, if the predicted die swell is too high, then the hydrogen concentration is increased or if the predicted die swell is too low, then the hydrogen concentration is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The following definitions are useful in understanding the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Various types of polyethylenes are known in the art. Low density polyethylene (&#x201c;LDPE&#x201d;) can be prepared at high pressure using free radical initiators and typically has a density in the range of 0.916-0.940 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. LDPE is also known as &#x201c;branched&#x201d; or &#x201c;heterogeneously branched&#x201d; polyethylene because of the relatively large number of long chain branches extending from the main polymer backbone. Polyethylene in the same density range, i.e., 0.915 to 0.940 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is linear and does not contain large quantities of long chain branching is also known; this &#x201c;linear low density polyethylene&#x201d; (&#x201c;LLDPE&#x201d;) can be produced with conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts or with single site catalysts, such as metallocene catalysts, discussed further below. Relatively higher density LDPE or LLDPE, typically in the range of 0.928 to 0.940 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>are sometimes referred to as medium density polyethylene (&#x201c;MDPE&#x201d;) or Linear Medium Density Polyethylene (&#x201c;LMDPE&#x201d;). Polyethylenes having still greater density are the high density polyethylenes (&#x201c;HDPEs&#x201d;), i.e., polyethylenes having densities greater than 0.940 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and are generally prepared with Ziegler-Natta catalysts, chrome catalysts or even single site catalysts such as metallocene catalysts. Very low density polyethylene (&#x201c;VLDPE&#x201d;) is also known. VLDPEs can be produced by a number of different processes yielding polymers with different properties, but can be generally described as polyethylenes having a density less than 0.915 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, typically 0.890 up to 0.915 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or 0.900 up to 0.915 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. VLDPEs produced using metallocene or other single-site catalysts, as discussed further below, are referred to as a type of plastomer. Plastomers having a density as low as 0.860 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>are commercially available. Polyethylenes produced using single-site catalysts are referred to herein using the prefix &#x201c;m&#x201d; before one of the above designations, depending on density, e.g., mLLDPE or mVLDPE. The densities above are those measured using ASTM D-1505.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Polyethylene generally may also be characterized as homopolymers or copolymers of ethylene. Polymers having more than two types of monomers, such as terpolymers, are also included within the term &#x201c;copolymer&#x201d; as used herein.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The comonomers that are useful in the present invention include alpha-olefins, such as C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>alpha-olefin and preferably C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alpha-olefins. The alpha-olefin comonomer can be linear or branched, and two or more comonomers can be used, if desired. Examples of suitable comonomers include linear C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alpha-olefins, and alpha-olefins having one or more C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3 </sub>alkyl branches, or an aryl group. Specific examples include propylene; 3-methyl-1-butene; 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene; 1-pentene; 1-butene; 1-pentene with one or more methyl, ethyl or propyl substituents; 1-hexene; 1-hexene with one or more methyl, ethyl or propyl substituents; 1-heptene with one or more methyl, ethyl or propyl substituents; 1-decene; 1-dodecene; 1-octene with one or more methyl, ethyl or propyl substituents; 1-nonene with one or more methyl, ethyl or propyl substituents; ethyl, methyl or dimethyl-substituted 1-decene; 1-dodecene; and styrene. It should be appreciated that the list of comonomers above is merely exemplary, and is not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one aspect of the invention, the polyolefin is selected from polypropylene homopolymer, polypropylene copolymers, and blends thereof. The homopolymer may be atactic polypropylene, isotactic polypropylene, syndiotactic polypropylene and blends thereof. The copolymer can be a random copolymer, a block copolymer, and blends thereof. In particular, polymer blends include so called impact copolymers, elastomers and plastomers, any of which may be physical blends or in situ blends of polypropylene and polypropylene copolymer. The method of making the polypropylene is not critical, as it can be made by slurry, solution, or gas phase processes, and by using either Ziegler-Natta-type catalysts, metallocene-type catalysts, or a combination thereof. Such catalysts are well known in the art, and are described in, for example, Z<smallcaps>IEGLER </smallcaps>C<smallcaps>ATALYSTS </smallcaps>(Gerhard Fink, Rolf Mulhaupt and Hans H. Brintzinger, eds., Springer-Verlag 1995); Resconi et al., <i>Selectivity in Propene Polymerization with Metallocene Catalysts, </i>100 C<smallcaps>HEM.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The polyolefin may be a propylene homopolymer. A desirable propylene homopolymer has a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) ranging from 1.5 to 10, and from 2.0 to 7 in another embodiment, and from 2.0 to 5 in yet another embodiment, and from 2.0 to 4 in yet another embodiment. The Gardner impact strength, tested on 0.125 inch disk at 23&#xb0; C., of the propylene homopolymer may range from 20 in-lb to 1000 in-lb in one embodiment, and from 30 in-lb to 500 in-lb in another embodiment, and from 40 in-lb to 400 in-lb in yet another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, the 1% secant flexural modulus of the propylene homopolymer ranges from 100 MPa to 2300 MPa, and from 200 MPa to 2100 MPa in another embodiment, and from 300 MPa to 2000 MPa in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable polyolefin may exhibit any combination of any upper flexural modulus limit with any lower flexural modulus limit. The melt flow rate (MFR) (ASTM D 1238, 230&#xb0; C., 2.16 kg) of propylene homopolymer ranges from 0.1 dg/min to 2500 dg/min in one embodiment, and from 0.3 to 500 dg/min in another embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The polypropylene homopolymer or copolymer useful in the present invention may have some level of isotacticity. Thus, in one embodiment, isotactic polypropylene is a useful polyolefin, and highly isotactic polypropylene in another embodiment. As used herein, &#x201c;isotactic&#x201d; is defined as having at least 10% isotactic pentads according to analysis by <sup>13</sup>C-NMR. As used herein, &#x201c;highly isotactic&#x201d; is defined as having at least 60% isotactic pentads according to analysis by <sup>13</sup>C-NMR.

<p id="p-0047" num="0053">An HDPE, sold by ExxonMobil Chemical Company under the designation AD60007 and useful for making blow-molded dairy bottles, was tested for tan (delta) at 150 C, tan (delta) at 155 C and melt index. The plaques for testing were prepared according to ASTM-D4703. Melt index testing was conducted according to ASTM-D1238 with a load of 2.16 kg. The oscillation dynamic rheology was conducted with a Rheometric Dynamic Analyzer III using 25-mm parallel plates, a temperature sweep from 145&#xb0; C. to 155&#xb0; C. at 4&#xb0; C./minute, with a strain of 10% and a frequency of 12.588 radians per second. The data is listed in Table 1. Graph 1 shows correlation between the actual die swell measured on articles made on a Uniloy blow molding apparatus versus the predicted die swell based on Equation 1. The partial least squares regression analysis of the data in Table 1 provided the Equation 1:

<p id="p-0049" num="0055">An HDPE powder resin, used to make AD60007 pellets, was tested for melt index according to ASTM-D1238 with a load of 2.16 kg. Plaques for testing were prepared according to ASTM-D4703. The oscillation dynamic rheology was conducted with a Rheometric Dynamic Analyzer III using 25 mm parallel plates, a temperature of 155&#xb0; C., a strain of 10% and a frequency sweep from 1 to 100 radians per second. The data is shown in Table 2. Graph 2 shows the actual versus predicted die swell based on the data in Table 2. The partial least squares on analysis of the data in Table 2 provided the Equation 2:

<p id="p-0051" num="0057">A HIC grade HDPE resin, sold by ExxonMobil Chemical Company under the designation AG45004, AA45004 and AS55003, was tested for melt index according to ASTM-D1238 with a load of 2.16 kg. Plaques for testing were prepared according to ASTM-D4703. The oscillation dynamic rheology was conducted with a Rheometric Dynamic Analyzer III using 25 mm parallel plates, a temperature sweep from 145&#xb0; C. to 155&#xb0; C. at 4&#xb0; C./minute, a strain of 10% and a frequency of 12.588 radians per second. The data is shown in Table 3. Graph 3 show the correlation of measured Uniloy die swell values versus predicted die swell (ODR predicted) values based on Equation 3. The partial least squares on analysis of the data in Table 3 provided the Equation 3:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Predicted die swell=6.34&#x2212;(24.5*tan (delta) at 155&#xb0; C.)+(1.55*melt index)+(0.0278*tan (delta) at 155&#xb0; C./melt index)+(23.7*tan (delta) at 145&#xb0; C.)&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 3<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

The partial least squares ion analysis of the data in Table 4 provided the Equation 4:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Predicted die swell=4.7881+(1.365*tan (delta) at 155&#xb0; C.)&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 4<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

<p id="p-0055" num="0061">An HDPE, sold by ExxonMobil Chemical Company under the designation AD60007, was tested for tan (delta) at 155&#xb0; C. and melt index. The plaques for testing were prepared according to ASTM-D4703. Melt index testing was conducted according to ASTM-D1238 with a load of 2.16 kg. The oscillation dynamic rheology (ODR) was conducted with a Rheometric Dynamic Analyzer III using 25 mm parallel plates, a temperature of 155&#xb0; C., with a strain of 10% and a frequency sweep from 1 to 100 radians per second. The data is listed in Table 5. Graph 5 shows correlation between the actual die swell measured on articles made on a Uniloy blow molding apparatus versus the predicted die swell based on Equation 5. The partial least squares regression analysis of the data in Table 5 provided the Equation 5:

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 2005-030343 filed on, Apr. 12, 2005, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a display device, and in particular to an organic light emitting display (OLED) having a structure to improve display quality.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An organic light emitting display (OLED) is self-emissive and generally includes a plurality of pixels. Each pixel includes an anode, an organic light emitting layer, and a cathode. The organic light emitting layer includes an organic material having a low molecular weight or polymer. When a voltage is applied to the pixel, a positive charge from the anode is combined with a negative charge from the cathode to form excitons in the organic light emitting layer, and light is generated from the organic light emitting layer when holes are combined with electrons moving to a lower energy state.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, a partition member is formed on the anode to cover edges of the anodes while exposing a portion of the anode via an aperture. Typically, the aperture has been a rectangular shape and the corners of the aperture have had right angles. The organic light emitting layer is formed by an ink jet method, in which an ink jet dispenses organic material through each aperture. The partition member holds the organic material in a specific pixel area and prevents organic material from diffusing to other pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Organic material has a liquid phase which has the property of keeping surface tension energy as low as possible. Therefore, when organic material is dispensed onto the anode through the aperture, the organic material forms into a spherical shape to keep the surface tension energy low. Disadvantageously, organic material cannot fill (or wet) sharp corners (e.g., at right or acute angles) of the aperture exposing the anode. If the corners of the aperture are not completely filled (or wetted) with organic material, the organic light emitting layer does not have uniform thickness. Lack of thickness uniformity causes the brightness of the display (i.e., display luminance) to lack uniformity. Also, the anode and cathode may contact and cause a short circuit in the area where organic material cannot fill completely.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, a display device with improved uniformity in the organic light emitting layer and a fabrication method thereof are highly desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect of the present invention, a display device includes: a substrate; a first electrode formed over the substrate; a partition member having a first aperture; an emitting control layer covering a portion of the first aperture and providing a second aperture to expose a portion of the first electrode, wherein the second aperture has a quadrangular shape with chamfered corners; a light emitting layer formed within the second aperture; and a second electrode formed over the partition member, the emitting control layer, and the light emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The emitting control layer extends from the edges or the corners of the partition member to cover a portion of the first aperture. The emitting control layer includes a material, such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, amorphous silicon, or polysilicon, having an affinity to organic material for forming a light emitting layer. The emitting control layer may be formed under the partition member in one example.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first aperture may have a quadrangular shape with chamfered corners or a substantially rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one example, the chamfered length &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the second aperture is defined by the equation 5 &#x3bc;m&#x3c;b&#x3c;a/2, where &#x201c;a&#x201d; represents a length of the shortest side of the second aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method of manufacturing a display device includes: providing a substrate, a first electrode formed over the substrate, and a partition member having a first aperture; covering a portion of the first aperture with an emitting control layer to provide a second aperture exposing a portion of the first electrode, wherein the second aperture has a quadrangular shape with chamfered corners; forming a light emitting layer within the second aperture; and forming a second electrode over the partition member, the emitting control layer, and the light emitting layer.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one example, chamfered length b satisfies equation 1 below.

where &#x201c;w&#x201d; is a predetermined length and &#x201c;a&#x201d; is the length of the shortest side of first aperture <b>275</b>. For example, &#x201c;a&#x201d; is a shorter one of longitudinal length a&#x2032; and latitudinal length a&#x2033;. In one example, &#x201c;w&#x201d; is about 5 &#x3bc;m, and thus chamfered length &#x201c;b&#x201d; is greater than 5 &#x3bc;m and less than a half of the shorter side (either a&#x2032; or a&#x2033;) of first aperture <b>275</b>. In another example, the longitudinal length &#x201c;a&#x201d; of aperture <b>275</b> is greater than about 10 &#x3bc;m, and the chamfered length &#x201c;b&#x201d; of aperture <b>275</b> is greater than about 5 &#x3bc;m.
</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Chamfered length &#x201c;b&#x201d; depends on various factors, including but not limited to gravity which influences a droplet of organic material dispensed within aperture <b>275</b>, size of the organic material droplet, surface roughness of partition member <b>270</b>, and a difference between a surface energy of the droplet and a surface energy where the organic material droplet is dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Organic material is dispensed by ink jet within aperture <b>275</b> of partition member <b>270</b> and is dried so that organic light emitting layer <b>243</b> is formed. Advantageously, the shape of first aperture <b>275</b> allows organic material droplets to disperse uniformly to all corners of first aperture <b>275</b>, causing organic light emitting layer <b>243</b> and first aperture <b>275</b> to have substantially the same shape with substantially the same lengths. Thus, a light emitting area of OLED has the quadrangular shape with chamfered corners having no acute angular vertex. Accordingly, uniformity of brightness (luminance) is increased and an opening ratio of first aperture <b>275</b> may also be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a partial plan view of a modified partition member aperture in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, emitting control layer <b>600</b> extends from edges of partition member <b>270</b> towards a center of first aperture <b>275</b> by a constant width, thus providing a second aperture <b>605</b> to expose interior portions of anode <b>241</b>. The second aperture <b>605</b> has a quadrangular shape with chamfered corners (e.g., the corners have no acute angular vertex).

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for synchronizing a clock signal with a reference signal is disclosed. One embodiment has a first synchronization part which has a bit pattern having a particular clock period, a pause whose length is a multiple of this clock period plus a fraction of the clock period, and a second synchronization part having the particular clock period. The method includes generating a phase difference signal which is proportional to a phase difference between the clock signal and the reference signal, filtering the phase difference signal and providing a filtered phase difference signal, driving a digital oscillator in such a manner that the frequency of the clock signal is changed on the basis of the filtered phase difference signal, the phase of the clock signal within a clock period being corrected by a value corresponding to the fraction of the clock period at an end of the pause in the reference signal.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Utility Patent Application claims priority to German Patent Application No. DE 10 2006 007 094.1-42 filed on Feb. 15, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a method for synchronizing a clock signal with a reference signal with the aid of a phase locked loop.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a digital transmission system, a transmitter uses a transmission channel to transmit a data word according to a transmission clock to a receiver. In order to be able to recover the digitally transmitted word from a received signal sequence, the receiver needs the transmission clock signal with which the word was transmitted. Since this clock signal is not concomitantly transmitted in many applications, the receiver must reconstruct the clock signal from the received signal sequence. Therefore a transmitted signal sequence generally includes a synchronization part which is placed in front of the data part. In this case, the receiver can reconstruct the transmission clock signal from the signal sequence, which is typically effected with the aid of a phase locked loop. These signal sequences are often standardized and cannot be arbitrarily configured by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A special signal sequence which is used, for example, in remotely controllable central locking systems in motor vehicles and which includes a code for opening or closing the vehicle in the data part is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The signal sequence <b>50</b> includes a first synchronization part <b>53</b>, a pause, a second synchronization part <b>54</b> and data words <b>55</b> which comprise, for example, a code for opening a vehicle. The synchronization parts <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> include a bit sequence which is also present in the transmission clock. The clock period of this transmission clock is denoted T<sub>Z </sub>below. A length T<sub>P </sub>of the pause <b>51</b> is equal to an integer multiple of the transmission clock period T<sub>Z </sub>plus a fraction of the transmission clock period T<sub>Z</sub>. The time t<sub>1 </sub>denotes the beginning of the pause <b>51</b> and the time t<sub>2 </sub>denotes the end of the pause <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The two synchronization parts <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> form the reference signal x which is interrupted by the pause <b>51</b> and can be used by a phase locked loop (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), which is arranged at the receiver end, to reconstruct the transmission clock signal. The reconstructed clock signal is available at the output of the phase locked loop and is at the same frequency and has the same phase as the reference signal x.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a conventional phase locked loop, the reconstructed transmission clock signal at the output of the phase locked loop is adjusted, during the first synchronization part <b>53</b> of the reference signal x, until its phase and frequency match the phase and frequency of the transmitted reference signal x. This adjustment results in a transient process during which the frequency of the reconstructed clock signal can vary slightly. During the pause <b>51</b> in the reference signal, regulation is interrupted and the clock signal at the output of the phase locked loop oscillates at that frequency and with that phase which it had at the beginning t<sub>1 </sub>of the pause <b>51</b>. However, after the end t<sub>2 </sub>of the pause <b>51</b>, regulation of the output signal is intended to be continued again. If the length T<sub>P </sub>of the pause were an integer multiple of the clock period T<sub>Z </sub>of the reference signal, it would be necessary to correct at most one small regulation error in the phase during the second synchronization part. However, since the length of the pause is a noninteger multiple of the clock period T<sub>Z</sub>, the clock signal and the reference signal x have a relatively large phase difference at the beginning of the second synchronization part, which in turn results in a relatively long transient regulation process during which the frequency of the output signal from the phase locked loop also changes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This transient process when adjusting the phase difference is inevitably present in the known phase locked loops and is justified by the principle of feedback. However, there is a need for a method for synchronizing a clock signal with a reference signal and for a corresponding phase locked loop, which provides a good stabilization process in the event of a sudden phase change in the reference signal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One embodiment of the invention provides a clock signal synchronized with a reference signal. In this case, the reference signal includes a first synchronization part having a bit pattern with a particular clock period, a pause whose length is a multiple of this clock period plus a fraction of this clock period, and a second synchronization part having this particular clock period.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one embodiment of the method, a phase difference signal which is proportional to a phase difference between the clock signal and the reference signal is generated. The method also involves filtering the phase difference signal and providing a filtered phase difference signal. In addition, a digital oscillator is driven in such a manner that the frequency of the clock signal is changed on the basis of the filtered phase difference signal. The phase of the clock signal within a clock period is corrected by a value corresponding to the fraction of the clock period at an end of the pause in the reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This correction is possible because the length of the pause and the resulting phase difference between the reconstructed clock signal and the reference signal are known. This known phase correction value is supplied to an oscillator, which generates the clock signal, during a clock period that follows the end of the pause, which oscillator, as a result, suddenly changes the phase of the clock signal (the output signal from the oscillator) without changing the frequency of the latter in the process.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">So that the phase locked loop does not continue to regulate during the pause in the reference signal and the oscillator which generates the clock signal remains in its state (that is to say the frequency and phase of the clock signal remain at that value which they had at the beginning of the pause), the phase difference signal is set to zero at the beginning of the pause, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The digital oscillator may have an accumulator register, at least one state memory and an adder. In this oscillator, the current value of the filtered phase difference signal is added to the value stored in the accumulator register in each clock period, and the known phase correction value is additionally added to the accumulator register, and thus the phase of the clock signal is suddenly corrected, only in that clock cycle in which the end of the pause is also detected.</p>

In this regard, directional terminology, such as &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;back,&#x201d; &#x201c;leading,&#x201d; &#x201c;trailing,&#x201d; etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the Figure(s) being described. Because components of embodiments of the present invention can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a signal sequence <b>50</b> as is used, for example, in remotely controllable central locking systems of motor vehicles. The reference signal x includes, in temporal succession, a first synchronization part <b>53</b>, a pause <b>51</b> of the length T<sub>P </sub>between the starting time t<sub>1 </sub>of the pause and the end time t<sub>2</sub>, and a second synchronization part <b>54</b>. The latter is followed by a data part <b>55</b> having data words which are to be transmitted and contain, for example, a code for opening or closing a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first synchronization part <b>53</b> includes a bit pattern (for example 101010101) having a transmission clock period T<sub>Z</sub>. The second synchronization part <b>54</b> includes a further bit pattern having the same transmission clock period T<sub>Z</sub>. However, this further bit pattern need not be identical to the bit pattern of the first synchronization part. In this case, the length of the pause T<sub>P </sub>is always a noninteger multiple of the clock period T<sub>Z</sub>. This method is used to synchronize a clock signal with the reference signal x, which has a pause <b>51</b>, and thus to reconstruct the transmission clock signal which is needed to correctly receive the data words transmitted in the data part <b>55</b> of the signal sequence <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a phase locked loop according to one embodiment of the invention having a phase correction unit <b>41</b>. The phase locked loop also includes a phase detector unit <b>10</b> having a first input and a second input. The reference signal x is supplied to the first input of the phase detector unit <b>10</b> and the clock signal y, which simultaneously represents the output signal from the phase locked loop, is supplied to the second input of the phase detector unit <b>10</b>. The phase detector unit <b>10</b> is designed to determine the phase difference between the reference signal x and the clock signal y and to provide a phase difference signal s, which is dependent on this phase difference, at a first output of the phase detector unit <b>10</b>. The phase detector unit <b>10</b> is also designed to signal the end t<sub>2 </sub>of the pause <b>51</b> in the reference signal x using an output signal en at a second output of the phase detector unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The phase locked loop also includes a loop filter unit <b>20</b> having an input and an output. The phase difference signal s is supplied to the input of the loop filter unit <b>20</b>. The loop filter unit typically has the characteristic of a PI filter or a P filter and is designed to provide a filtered phase difference signal s&#x2032; at its output.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">This filtered phase difference signal s&#x2032; is supplied to a first input of an oscillator unit <b>30</b>. The oscillator unit <b>30</b> is designed to change the frequency of the clock signal y, which is provided at a first output of the oscillator unit, in accordance with this phase difference signal. If the end t<sub>2 </sub>of the pause <b>51</b> in the reference signal x is signaled at the second output of the phase detector <b>10</b> using the output signal en, a phase correction value y<sub>corr</sub>, which is stored in a memory <b>40</b> and is used to correct the phase of the clock signal y in a clock period by that phase correction value y<sub>corr</sub>, is additionally supplied to a second input of the oscillator. The phase correction unit <b>41</b> detects and signals the end t<sub>2 </sub>of the pause <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one possible implementation of the oscillator unit <b>30</b>. The latter includes a state memory <b>31</b>, an adder <b>32</b>, a modulo 2<sup>n </sup>operator <b>33</b> and an accumulator register <b>34</b>. The filtered phase difference signal s&#x2032;, the value stored in the state memory <b>31</b> and, depending on the signal en, the phase correction value y<sub>corr </sub>as well are supplied to the adder. The output of the adder is connected to the input of the modulo 2<sup>n </sup>operator <b>33</b> whose output is in turn connected to the accumulator register <b>34</b>. The respective current value of the reconstructed transmission clock signal y is stored in this accumulator register <b>34</b>. The value is additionally stored in the state memory <b>31</b> which is feedback-connected to the adder so that the value of the reconstructed transmission clock signal y is again available as the summand for the next addition.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The adder adds the value of the filtered phase difference signal s&#x2032; and, depending on whether the phase detector unit signals an end of a pause in the reference signal x, also a phase correction value y<sub>corr </sub>to the value of the clock signal y stored in the state memory <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In practice, the modulo 2<sup>n </sup>operator <b>33</b> is automatically implemented using the overflow of the accumulator register having a word length of n bits, the accumulator register constituting the result register of the adder. If the addition results in a value of greater than 2<sup>n</sup>, where n is the word length of the accumulator register, the register overflows, that is to say the mod 2<sup>n </sup>operation is also applied to the result of the addition. Overflowing of the accumulator register corresponds to the end of an individual clock period T<sub>Z</sub>.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of telecommunications and, in that field, to methods of setting up a transfer of data between two communications devices that are connected to each other by a telecommunications network, and to communications devices for setting up this kind of transfer. The terminal portion of the network connected to a communications device is called a subscriber line. These methods of setting up a transfer of data are operative in particular when setting up a videoconference between two computers connected to each other by a telecommunications network. In the remainder of the application, the term &#x201c;network&#x201d; refers interchangeably to a plurality of segments of the same network and to a set of segments of different interconnected networks forming a web that may in particular be implemented by a public switched telephone network (PSTN), or by packet mode transmission networks, of which the TCP/IP network commonly known as the Internet is one example, as opposed to switched networks. The transmission control protocol (TCP) is a level 4 (transport layer) connected mode protocol used on the Internet over the Internet Protocol (IP). There are other networks that use the IP, in particular UDP/IP networks. The UDP (user datagram protocol) is a level 4 (transport layer) non-connected mode protocol used on the Internet over the IP. Below in this application, a network using the IP is referred to as an IP network. The term &#x201c;subscriber line&#x201d; means a telecommunications line set up either via a fixed network or via a wireless network. In each case the subscriber line is identified by the telephone number assigned to the person or entity responsible for paying the line subscription charges.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Prior art videoconference systems fall into two categories.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A first category comprises professional point-to-point and point-to-multipoint systems, which use a digital telephone-network such as the ISDN and conform to the H320 standard. They enable users to contact one another using their telephone subscriber numbers. They are limited by the capacity of an ISDN line, which is at most twice 64 kbit/s. It is possible to couple a plurality of ISDN lines together to increase capacity, but this leads to an increase in the cost of using the system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A second category comprises consumer systems using the Internet and conforming to the H323 standard, for example. These systems exploit the high capacity of the offers from Internet service providers (ISP). Using asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) technology, these offers provide capacities of 64 kbit/s in the uplink direction and 128 kbit/s in the downlink direction, or even 256 kbit/s and 1024 kbit/s, respectively. The methods employed by these systems provide very good picture and sound quality, but they do have drawbacks. One of the more important drawbacks is that their bit rate is not guaranteed. However, since these offers are based on a fixed charge for access to the Internet, calls cost the user nothing. Moreover, when executed by a computer, these methods require the user to have some knowledge of the underlying technicalities of computer identification on the Internet, and more generally on any IP network. Obtaining a fixed IP address that identifies a computer permanently is a costly operation for a consumer. This leads to the use of temporary IP addresses assigned to the user by the service provider. This address is not only temporary but also assigned for a period that is unknown to the user, which is reflected in unilateral withdrawal of the address at the initiative of the ISP at the end of that period. Although the user may immediately demand another IP address, and obtain it quickly, this withdrawal of the IP address without warning suddenly breaks off any videoconference that might be in progress.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Users wishing to interconnect in an IP videoconference may simplify their task by using dynamic domain name servers (DNS) which indicate the latest IP address assigned to a computer, provided that the symbolic name given to the computer is known. This method therefore enables the IP address of the computer with which the videoconference must be established to be recovered by interrogating a dynamic DNS. However, it has the following drawbacks. Firstly, the user must know the addresses of the dynamic DNSes. Secondly, each computer must declare itself to the dynamic DNS(es) so that they can identify it (them). Moreover, the user must know the symbolic name of the computer that is to be connected in a videoconference. Furthermore, the dynamic DNSes must be available for users to be able to interrogate them. Finally, this method necessitates intermediate equipment for setting up a videoconference between two computers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the invention is to alleviate the drawbacks of prior art techniques of setting up a transfer of data between first and second devices by means of a telecommunications network comprising an IP network. A particular object of the invention is to facilitate the relaunching of a session between two devices to re-establish an interrupted videoconference between those devices as a result of a change in the IP address of one of the devices.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To this end, the invention provides a method of setting up a transfer of data between a first communications device and a second communications device connected to each other by means of a telecommunications network comprising an IP network. The first device is equipped with software for sending/receiving data transmitted by the network, a first network interface connected to a subscriber line of the telecommunications network conveying a signaling channel and a second network interface connected to a subscriber line of the telecommunications network conveying a data channel. The method includes the step of the first device sending its IP address to the second device via the signaling channel using a specific signaling mode.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention further provides a communications device for setting up a transfer of data with another communications device. The device is equipped with data sending/receiving software, a first network interface and a second network interface. Each of the two network interfaces is connected to the same subscriber line conveying a signaling channel and a data channel separated by a filter and sent to the first network interface and to the second network interface, respectively. The device includes software for executing the step of the device sending its IP address to the other device via the signaling channel using a specific signaling mode.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus the use of a particular signaling mode on a signaling channel enables the first device to send its IP address to the second device. The second device can then call the first device, knowing its IP address.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Consequently, a method and a device of the invention limit user intervention in the process of recovering the IP addresses of the corresponding devices and consequently limit the problems that users may encounter in relaunching a session.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one particular embodiment of the above device the software is further adapted to execute the following preliminary steps:</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">the device is connected to an IP network via its data channel and via a service provider, and</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">the device stores a dynamic address supplied by the service provider to which it is connected, and the following step:</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">the device waits for a call from the other device sent on the data channel using the IP address of the device known to the other device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">After sending its IP address, the first device preferably waits for a call from the second device sent on the data channel using the IP address of the first device known to the second device. This preferred mode secures the sending and receiving of data by refusing any call other than that emanating from the second device, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The invention further provides a method of setting up a transfer of data between a first communications device and a second communications device. The first device is equipped with software for sending/receiving data, a first network interface connected to a subscriber line of the telecommunications network conveying a signaling channel, and a second network interface connected to a subscriber line of the telecommunications network conveying a data channel. Each subscriber line is connected to an IP network including an IP directory in accordance with the ENUM standard that identifies a device from its telephone number. The method comprises the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">the first device is connected to an IP network via the data channel and via a service provider,</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">the first device stores a dynamic address supplied by the service provider to which it is connected and enters that address in the directory,</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">the first device calls the second device on the signaling channel to trigger interrogation of the directory by the second device and reading by the latter of the IP address of the first device, and</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">the first device waits from a call from the second device sent on the data channel by means of the IP address of the first device read in the directory by the second device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this mode, the IP address of the first device is sent indirectly to the second device by means of a signaling channel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention further provides a method of setting up a transfer of data between a first communications device and a second communications device. Each of the two devices is equipped with software for sending/receiving data, a first network interface connected to a subscriber line of the telecommunications network conveying a signaling channel, and a second network interface connected to a subscriber line of the telecommunications network conveying a data channel. The method comprises the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">the first device is connected to an IP network via its data channel and via a service provider,</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">the first device stores a dynamic address supplied by the service provider to which it is connected,</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">the first device sends its IP address to the second device via its signaling channel using a specific signaling mode and, in response to the sending of the IP address from the first device to the second device:</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">the second device is connected to an IP network via its data channel and via a service provider,</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">the second device stores a dynamic address supplied by the service provider to which it is connected,</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">the second device sends its IP address to the first device via its signaling channel using a specific signaling mode, and</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">when prompted by its data sending/receiving software, the first device sends a call to the second device on its data channel using the IP address of the second device.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The invention further provides a method of setting up a transfer of data between a first communications device and a second communications device. Each of the two devices is equipped with software for sending/receiving data, a first network interface connected to a subscriber line of the telecommunications network conveying a signaling channel, and a second network interface connected to a subscriber line of the telecommunications network conveying a data channel. The method comprises the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">each of the two devices is connected to an IP network via its data channel and via a service provider,</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">each of the two devices stores a dynamic address supplied by the service provider to which it is connected,</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">each of the two devices sends its IP address to the other device via its signaling channel using a specific signaling mode, and</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">when prompted by its data sending/software, the first device sends a call to the second device on its data channel using the IP address of the latter device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The network interfaces handle adaptation of the signals sent via the network between the device and the network. The network interfaces are modems if the subscriber line(s) of the device form(s) part of a PSTN coupled to an xDSL offer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The invention applies equally to a fixed network with xDSL offers and to a mobile network. In particular, the general packet radio services (GPRS) standard defines a plurality of channels including a low bit rate digital voice channel that may in particular serve as a signaling channel and high bit rate channels intended for IP data transmission. Moreover, the invention may be implemented with any fixed or mobile IP data network, not only with a network coupled to xDSL offers.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Thus the subscriber line may form part of different types of network.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the case of an analog network, the IP address is sent in DTMF mode using voice frequencies on a voice channel of the signaling channel. In particular, the IP address, consisting of a series of digits, is transmitted in dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) mode in the form of a sequence of dual tones resulting from the translation of each digit into two frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, in the case of an analog network (PSTN) having a number and name offering function, IP addresses may be sent using an analog signaling mode for number and name offering.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the case of a digital network (ISDN), IP addresses are sent using a D channel signaling mode. In particular, the IP address, consisting of a series of digits, is sent in the Q.931 signaling mode, instead of the calling user's installation number.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The method of the invention may be used for different types of data exchange. The uses of the invention include videoconferences and file transfer between two devices in accordance with the file transfer protocol (FTP), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a manner complementary to sending IP addresses, the method may additionally send an indication of the remote service that is to be activated. To this end, it may use a mechanism similar to that used by standard IP ports, whereby the first device sends a code in addition to its IP address. For example, the use of a code 21 signifies that the device wishes to perform an FTP file transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The subscriber line may be common to both network interfaces or different for each of the two network interfaces. When the subscriber line is common to both network interfaces, the signaling channel and the data channel are conveyed by the same subscriber line, are separated by a filter, and are sent towards the first network interface and the second network interface, respectively. If there is a different subscriber line for each of the two network interfaces, the signaling channel is conveyed on the subscriber line connected to the first network interface and the data channel is conveyed on the subscriber line connected to the second network interface.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Any implementation of a method of the invention may either be started automatically when the device on which the method is executed is started up or it may be initiated by external action. The external action may consist in the activation of a user interface of the device. Furthermore, the sending of its IP address by the first device may either follow on automatically from storing its IP address or be initiated by external action. This action may be dialing the subscriber number of the second device on a telephone connected to the first device and to the subscriber line of the first device, the first device detecting the number dialed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A communications device of the invention is typically a personal computer. It may nevertheless take other forms, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or any other device that incorporates the means necessary for executing a method according to the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart of one implementation of a method of the invention. This implementation of the method is used to set up a videoconference between first and second devices via an IP network, which in this example is the Internet. The first device is equipped with videoconference software, a low bit rate modem and a high bit rate modem. Each of the two modems is connected to the same subscriber line, which conveys a low bit rate channel and a high bit rate channel separated by a filter and sent respectively to the low bit rate modem and to the high bit rate modem.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The method <b>1</b> comprises the steps described below.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a first step, the first device is connected (2) to the Internet via a service provider on its high bit rate channel.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a second step, the first device stores (3) a dynamic IP address assigned by the service provider to which it is connected.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In a third step, the first device sends (4) its IP address to the second device via the signaling channel and using a specific signaling mode. The first device may send the code 1720 with its IP address to tell the second device that it wishes to set up a videoconference.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of a first implementation of a method of the invention for establishing a transfer of data to establish a videoconference.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this implementation of the method two users A and B set up a telephone call and, while conversing, decide to continue by way of a videoconference.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each user A, B has a computer DVA, DVB and a telephone TA, TB. For each of the users A and B, the telephone TA or TB, is connected to a public switched telephone network PSTN by an xDSL subscriber line. The computer DVA or DVB, is connected to an IP network, which is the Internet in this example, by means of the same subscriber line as the corresponding telephone terminal TA or TB, and via a service provider ISP_A or ISP_B. The subscriber line of each of the users A and B conveys a low bit rate channel called the voice and signaling channel and a high bit rate channel called the data channel.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a first time period T<b>1</b>, user A uses the telephone handset TA to call the other party B on the low bit rate channel of that party's subscriber line. User A dials the telephone number of party B on his telephone handset TA. After party B has picked up the handset, user A and party B converse.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a second time period T<b>2</b>, the users A and B decide to continue by way of a videoconference. User A clicks on a button for activating the videoconference software installed on computer DVA. This connects the computer DVA to the Internet via the high bit rate channel of User A's subscriber line and via User A's service provider ISP_A. The service provider ISP_A assigns a dynamic IP address to the computer DVA. The computer DVA stores this IP address.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a third time period T<b>3</b>, the computer DVA sends its IP address to the computer of user B. The computer DVA sends this address via the low bit rate (voice) channel of user A's subscriber line using DTMF voice frequencies. Thus the IPv4 address, which comprises four sets of three digits, is sent in the form of a sequence of twelve dual tones.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">From the point of view of user B, the computer DVB may receive the IP address of user A in another signaling mode, in particular a signaling mode that is related to the type of network including user B's subscriber line. For example, if user B's subscriber line is part of a digital network, then the IP address may be received in a D channel signaling mode.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a fourth time period T<b>4</b>, user B's computer DVB is connected to the Internet via the high bit rate channel of the corresponding subscriber line. This connection follows reception of user A's IP address on the low bit rate channel and is effected via user B's service provider ISP_B. The service provider ISP_B assigns a dynamic IP address to the computer DVB. The computer DVB stores this IP address.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a fifth time period T<b>5</b>, the computer DVB sends a call for a videoconference to the computer DVA on the high bit rate channel of user B's subscriber line using the IP address of the computer DVA.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Once the videoconference has been set up, the users A and B may communicate on the high bit rate channel and can terminate their telephone conversation. However, if both users wish to optimize the real bit rate available on the IP link, they may continue the telephone call and not activate the audio coders/decoders controlled by the videoconference software. A configuration of this kind provides the maximum quality and fluidity for the available bit rate.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If the videoconference session is suddenly broken off following a change of IP address or a unilateral disconnection by one of the service providers ISP_A or ISP_B, it may be relaunched automatically or manually. Automatic or manual relaunching restarts the session from the second stage. However, in the case of a manual relaunch by one of the users, or by both users independently of each other, the user(s) may choose to phone first. Relaunching may be automatic because the disconnected device is able to diagnose the cause of the break in a manner that is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Unilateral disconnection by the service provider is referred to as a drop. For example, there are ADSL offers for which a drop occurs every 24 hours or once a week. Subscribing to a fixed IP address service does not avoid the drop. However, the IP address supplied by the service provider is always the same on each connection, for example after a drop.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram of a second implementation of a method of the invention for establishing a transfer of data to establish a videoconference.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Each user A, B has a computer DVA, DVB and a telephone TA, TB. For each of the users A and B, the telephone TA or TB is connected to a public switched telephone network PSTN by an xDSL subscriber line. The computers DVA and DVB are connected to the Internet via the same subscriber lines as the corresponding telephone terminals TA and TB, and via respective service providers ISP_A and ISP_B. The subscriber line conveys a low bit rate channel called the voice and signaling channel and a high bit rate channel called the data channel.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In a first time period T<b>1</b>, while it is started up, user A's computer DVA is connected to the Internet via the high bit rate channel of the subscriber line and via the service provider ISP_A. The service provider ISP_A assigns a dynamic IP address to the computer DVA. The computer DVA stores this IP address.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a second time period T<b>2</b>, the computer DVA sends its IP address to user B's computer DVB. The computer DVA sends this address via the low bit rate channel of user A's subscriber line. The computer DVA may prompt user A to enter user B's telephone number. This number may be a default value stored by the computer DVA. Alternatively, user B's telephone number may be entered via user A's telephone TA. This presupposes that the computer DVA has means for detecting the off-hook condition and reading the number that is entered. In this case, the computer DVA starts sending its IP address using the number it has read. The IP address is sent using a signaling mode. As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it may be sent using DTMF voice frequencies on the speech channel in the case of an analog PSTN. The signaling mode used in the case of an analog PSTN may be an analog signaling mode for number and name offering. Accordingly, by adapting the call processing effected within the network, the computer DVA calls the telephone number of the computer DVB and at the same time transmits its own dynamic IP address, for example by dialing over an established connection. In the case of an ISDN, the IP address may be sent by means of a D channel signaling mode. Thus the IP address may be sent in the signaling instead of the subscriber installation number or supplementary designation number (SDN).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In a third time period T<b>3</b>, the computer DVB receives the telephone call from the computer DVA via the low bit rate channel of user B's subscriber line, the calling telephone number and the dynamic ID address of the computer DVA being indicated in the signaling. The computer DVB may instigate an alert to advise user B of a videoconference call request. User B may choose between:

        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0075">responding to the videoconference request, in which case the videoconference is accepted by clicking on a button for activating the videoconference software installed on the computer DVB, for example. In this case, the computer DVB does not respond to the call on the low bit rate channel. Alternatively, the videoconference software installed on the computer DVB may be equipped with a button that limits the videoconference to the exchange of speech, which is the equivalent of Telephone over IP (ToIP). This may be combined with another button for setting up the exchange of pictures and selecting a videoconference configuration with exchange of pictures and audio data.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">In a fourth time period T<b>4</b>, user B's computer DVB is connected to the Internet via the high bit rate channel of the subscriber line. This connection is made on acceptance of the videoconference request after the IP address of computer DVA is received on the low bit rate channel. The connection is made via user B's service provider ISP_B. The service provider ISP_B assigns a dynamic IP address to the computer DVB. The computer DVB stores this IP address.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">In a fifth time period T<b>5</b>, the computer DVB sends a call for a videoconference to the computer DVA on the high bit rate channel of user B's subscriber line and using the IP address of the computer DVA. Once the videoconference has been set up between the computers, user A may hang up on telephone TA, if it is off-hook, in order to clear down the telephone call. Alternatively, this may be done automatically by the computer DVA.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078">Once the videoconference has been set up, users A and B may communicate over their high bit rate channel.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">If the videoconference session is broken off suddenly as the result of a change of IP address or unilateral disconnection by one of the service providers ISP-A or ISP-B, the session may be relaunched automatically or manually. Automatic or manual relaunching restarts the session from the first stage. The relaunch may be automatic because the disconnected device is able to diagnose the cause of the break in a manner that is known in the art.</p>

The computers DVA and DVB are connected to the Internet via the same subscriber lines as the corresponding telephone terminals TA and TB, and via respective service providers ISP_A and ISP_B. The Internet provides an IP directory conforming to the ENUM standard which identifies a device from its telephone number.

<p id="p-0083" num="0084">In a third time period T<b>3</b>, the computer DVA prompts the computer DVB to read its IP address in the ENUM directory by means of a call sent on the low bit rate channel of user A's subscriber line. This call is the direct result of user A picking up telephone TA handset and entering user B's telephone number, or of the equivalent action performed by the computer DVA. In which case, in order to contact the other party, the computer DVA may prompt user A to enter user B's telephone number, which may be a default value stored by the computer DVA.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">The computer DVB receives the telephone call from the computer DVA via the low bit rate channel of user A's subscriber line.

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Customer Traffic may be segregated using customer provisioned IPSec VPNs implemented using group security association for IPSec tunnels, by causing the CE network element to implement multiple VRFs for the several VPNs, each of which may be used for a different segment of the customer's traffic. The CE network element may implement a single MPBGP peering session with the GCKS/RR for all VPNs, and may establish secure data channels for each of the VPNs based on the group security associations for each of the VPNs. Although a common MPBGP peering session may be used, routing information for the several VRFs may be separated by applying per-VRF import policies at the CE, so that each VPN only has access to routes intended to be advertised to that VPN.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to U.S. Patent Application entitled Method And Apparatus For Learning Endpoint Addresses of IPSec VPN Tunnels, filed on even date herewith, the content of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to communication networks and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for supporting multiple customer provisioned EPSec VPNs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Data communication networks may include various computers, servers, nodes, routers, switches, bridges, hubs, proxies, and other network devices coupled together and configured to pass data to one another. These devices will be referred to herein as &#x201c;network elements.&#x201d; Data is communicated through the data communication network by passing protocol data units, such as data frames, packets, cells, or segments, between the network elements by utilizing one or more communication links. A particular protocol data unit may be handled by multiple network elements and cross multiple communication links as it travels between its source and its destination over the network.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The various network elements on the communication network communicate with each other using predefined sets of rules, referred to herein as protocols. Different protocols are used to govern different aspects of the communication, such as how signals should be formed for transmission between network elements, various aspects of what the protocol data units should look like, how packets should be handled or routed through the network by the network elements, and how information associated with routing information should be exchanged between the network elements. Two networks with the same network topography may operate in completely different ways depending on the particular protocols selected to enable the network elements to interoperate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example communication network <b>10</b> in which VPN tunnels may be established to interconnect CEs connected to one or more VPN sites. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a service provider provides interconnectivity amongst Customer Edge (CE) network elements <b>12</b>. A CE device <b>12</b> is a device which connects one or more VPN sites <b>14</b> to a Provider Edge node <b>16</b>. Essentially, a CE device allows one or more VPN sites to interconnect with an external network so that one or more VPN sites may be interconnected over the communication network <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A Provider Edge (PE) node is a router which connects to one or more CE devices using a dynamic routing protocol to exchange CE reachability information. The PE connects with at least one other PE or P node. When handling Internet Protocol (IP) MultiProtocol Label Switched (MPLS) traffic, a PE node acts as a Label Edge Router which terminates Label Switched Path (LSP) tunnels used to forward traffic to other PE nodes. PE nodes may be directly connected to other PE nodes, or may be connected through other network elements such as backbone routers <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Backbone routers <b>18</b> are commonly designated in the industry by the letter P. The Provider &#x201c;P&#x201d; routers are backbone routers which provide interior gateway protocol connectivity between PE nodes. It may be possible for a given router to act as a PE node for some VPNs and as a P router for other VPNs, however, depending on the configuration of the communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A Virtual Private Network (VPN) may be formed by securing communications between two or more networks or network elements to form a VPN tunnel, such as by encrypting or encapsulating transmissions between the networks or network elements. Using VPN tunnels enables geographically dispersed VPN sites to exchange information securely without obtaining dedicated resources through the network.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There are several common ways of establishing VPN tunnels on a network. For example, VPNs may be implemented at the Provider Edge (PE) network elements to allow the service provider to provision VPN services on behalf of the network customers. One common way to do this is described in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request For Comments (RFC) 2547, the content of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. RFC 2547 describes a VPN architecture in which MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS)&#x2014;based tunnels are used to forward packets over the network backbone. A protocol referred to as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute routes over the backbone for VPNs provisioned through a particular PE network element. Routing information for the Provider-Provisioned VPNs is stored in a VPN routing and forwarding table (VRF) or a distinguishable area of the PE's common VRF.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A VPN also may be established by customers themselves independent of the provider by deploying CE network elements configured with VPN software. One common way to implement a CE-based VPN is to create Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) tunnels through the communication network. An IPSec based VPN uses point-to-point IPSec tunnels formed using an EPSec Security Association (SA) between every pair of CEs that are connected to VPN sites on the VPN. As the number of VPN sites grow, this point-to-point solution does not scale, since the number of SAs required to implement the VPN will increase on the order on n<sup>2</sup>. To overcome this, it is possible to use a group SA to enable all tunnels between the CEs on the VPN to use the same security association. A Group Controller Key Server (GCKS) may be used to manage the group security association for the VPN.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a CE-based VPN, to enable devices on one VPN site to communicate with devices on another VPN site via an IPSec VPN tunnel, it is necessary to exchange VPN routing information between the two CEs connected to the VPN sites. The routing information enables the CEs to learn which VPN addresses may be reached via the VPN. As VPN sites and network elements are added and removed from the networks, the new routing information will be advertised to the other CEs connected to participating sites in the VPN.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Where MultiProtocol Border Gateway Protocol (MPBGP) is being used to distribute VPN routing information on a VPN, a given CE will establish an MPBGP peering session with every other CE with which it would like to exchange routing information. Where there are many CEs in the VPN, the GCKS may also serve as a route reflector to enable BGP routes to be exchanged between the various CEs by causing each CE to establish a single peering session with the route reflector, which will then distribute the routes to the other CEs.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Although the GCKS model of CE based VPNs is a single customer solution and supports a single VPN today, at times it may be desirable for a customer to be able to segregate traffic so that not all data is available to all users of the customer's network. For example, in a large corporation it may be desirable to segregate traffic between departments, so that each department is able to communicate securely without enabling other people in the company to have access to the data. An example of this may be where human resources has sensitive personal information about the corporation's employees that should not be made available to other persons within the corporation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">One way to implement multiple VPNs using a given CE is to cause the CE to instantiate multiple Virtual Routers, each of which may be used to handle traffic for a different VPN. A virtual router is a software construct in a physical router that has all the attributes of a physical router, but which shares processor time, switch plane resources, and other physical resources of the physical router. Because the virtual router is logically separate from other virtual routers, it has its own routing space, its own policy information, and is able to be provisioned much the same as any other router on the network. Virtual router based VPNs (VR-based VPNs) are described, for example, in an IETF Internet-Draft by Paul Knight, et al., entitled &#x201c;Network-based IP VPN Architecture using Virtual Routers,&#x201d; July 2002, the content of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Conventionally, the use of virtual routers to implement multiple CE-based VPNs has required the CEs to obtain Security associations with multiple other CEs on a per-CE pair basis. Additionally, since the virtual routers are independent processes, each virtual router is required to exchange routing information with the other sites in its VPN. Thus, although multiple virtual routers may be used to implement multiple CE-based IPSec VPNs to segregate customer traffic, it would be advantageous to provide another way in which traffic for a given customer may be segregated using customer provisioned VPNs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Traffic may be segregated using customer provisioned IPSec VPNs implemented using IPSec tunnels, by causing the CE network element to implement multiple VRFs for the several VPNs, each of which may be used for a different segment of the customer's traffic. The CE network element may implement a single MPBGP peering session with the GCKS/RR for all VPNs, and may establish unique secure data channels for each of the EPSec VPNs. Although a common MPBGP peering session may be used, routing information for the several VRFs may be separated by applying per-VRF import policies at the CE, so that each VPN only has access to routes intended to be advertised to that VPN. Thus, a single secure control channel between each CE and the GCKS/RR may be used to exchange routing information for all VPNs associated with the customer, while enabling different group security associations for each of the VPNs to be established so that traffic within the several VPNs may be kept secure.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The following detailed description sets forth numerous specific details to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, protocols, algorithms, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an IPSec encrypted IP packet that may be used to transfer data over an IPSec secure tunnel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an original IP packet <b>22</b> includes the original IP header <b>24</b> and the original payload <b>26</b>. When the packet is encrypted according to the IPSec standard, the encryption algorithm will add an Encapsulated Secure Payload (ESP) header <b>28</b>, an ESP trailer <b>30</b>, and an ESP authentication field <b>32</b>. The new packet will also be provided with a new outer IP header <b>34</b> that will be used to route the encrypted packet across the network. IPSec is well documented and, accordingly, a detailed explanation of how IPSec works will not be provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example communication network <b>50</b> in which VPN tunnels <b>52</b> have been configured between CE network elements <b>54</b>. Addresses A, B, C, and D are the public addresses of the CEs <b>54</b> and the GCKS <b>20</b>, and are also the IPSec tunnel endpoints for secure data channels (tunnels <b>52</b>) that extend between the VPN sites. A secure control channel <b>58</b> extends between the GCKS <b>56</b> and each of the CEs <b>54</b>. According to an embodiment of the invention, each CE network element may implement multiple VRF processes (one for each VPN site attached to the CE) to enable customer traffic to be separated, while using a common secure control channel to handle routing information for the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When a CE comes up, the CE will register with the GCKS <b>56</b> and establishes a secure control channel <b>58</b> with the GCKS. The secure control channel is represented as an unnumbered IP interface on the CE and terminates at the Network Routing Engine (NRE) on the CE. The NRE, in this context, is a Linux process containing the routing protocols and routing table for the service provider network. The NRE may be configured to operate as specified in IEEE RFC <b>2547</b>. A single BGP session runs between each CE and the GCKS over the secure control channel <b>58</b> regardless of the number of VPNs (VRFs) at the CE.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For each Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) <b>62</b> the CE <b>12</b> will establish a secure data channel <b>52</b>, which may be implemented as an IPSec tunnel. Each VPN will have a separate group secure association (key) obtained from the GCKS that will be used to encrypt data on the secure data channel for that VPN. The secure data channel is also represented as an unnumbered IP interface that terminates at the NRE. The NRE in the CE maintains a mapping between import Route Target (RT) to VRF to enable the NRE to populate the correct VRFs with the VPN routes received from other CEs.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the network shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, MPBGP may be used by the CEs to exchange routes (i.e. via the route reflector <b>60</b>), although the CEs may also exchange routes with each other directly via individual peering sessions. The MP-BGP extension for ipv4-vpn route exchange may be used in this context to exchange routes between the CEs directly or via the route reflector.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The VRFs maintain routing tables for routes that are relevant to their segregated section of the customer traffic. For example, as routes are received from the route reflector, the NRE will direct the routes to the correct VRF according to the route target contained in the route. In MPBGP, a route generally has three parts&#x2014;a route distinguisher which ensures uniqueness of IP routes in the presence of overlapping IP addresses between VPN sites, a next hop value, and a route target that designates the VLAN or VPN to which the route belongs. When a route is received, the NRE may use the route target value to identify which VRF should receive the route advertisement so that the routing table for that VRF may be updated to include the new route.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Table 1 shows the per-VRF routing tables after receipt of the routing updates shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (i.e. after receipt of routes &#x3c;RDa:a1, B, RTa&#x3e;; &#x3c;RDa:a2, B, RTa&#x3e;; &#x3c;RDb:b1, B, RTb&#x3e;; &#x3c;RDc:c1, C, RTc&#x3e;).</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As may be seen from Table 2, the per-VRF routing tables enable different portions of the customer's network to be segregated by causing only those routes relevant to the VPN to be imported into the VRF for that VPN, while enabling a single MPBGP session to be used to exchange routing information for all of the VPNs supported by the CE.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The NRE will also maintain routing tables so that it is able to direct traffic being handled by the CE. Once the CE has registered with the GCKS and established the secure control channel, the interface table in the NRE will contain an entry for the secure control channel. As the VRFs register with the GCKS, the interfaces will be added to the interface table in the NRE. Ultimately, once the secure control channel with the GCKS and the secure data channels have been established for each of the VRFs, the NRE interface table will include a mapping between the interface name and the interface ID for each of the secure control channels, secure data channels, and local interfaces. Interfaces may be logical or physical, and the network element will implement other processes to handle traffic based on the definition of the particular interface for particular traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of a CE network element <b>54</b> that may be configured to implement an embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the CE network element <b>54</b> generally includes a control plane <b>70</b> and a data plane <b>72</b>. The control plane <b>70</b> is configured to control operation of the network element <b>54</b> by specifying how the data plane <b>72</b> should handle particular packets or classes of packets. The control plane generally includes control service cards <b>74</b>, each of which includes one or more processors such as a CPU <b>76</b>. A bus <b>78</b> may be provided to interconnect the control service cards <b>74</b> to enable data and instructions to be communicated between the CPUs <b>76</b> in the control plane <b>70</b>. The CPUs may host VRFs <b>62</b>, NRE <b>63</b>, and other applications such as the sub-manager <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The network element <b>54</b> also includes a data plane <b>72</b> configured to handle packets of data on the communication network. The data plane <b>72</b> generally includes one or more Input/Output (I/O) cards <b>82</b>, one or more data service cards <b>84</b>, and a switch fabric <b>86</b>. Packets received over the I/O cards <b>82</b> are passed to the data service cards <b>84</b>, and then to the switch fabric <b>86</b>. The switch fabric <b>86</b> enables a packet entering on a port on one or more I/O cards <b>82</b> to be output at a different port in a conventional manner. A packet returning from the switch fabric <b>86</b> is received by one or more of the data service cards <b>84</b> and passed to one or more I/O cards <b>82</b>. The packet may be handled by the same data service card <b>84</b> on both the ingress and egress paths or may be handled by different data service cards <b>84</b> on the ingress and egress paths.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The I/O cards <b>82</b> are configured to connect to links in the communications network <b>50</b>. The I/O cards <b>82</b> may include physical ports, such as optical ports, electrical ports, wireless ports, infrared ports, or ports configured to communicate with other physical media, as well as configurable logical elements capable of being programmed to implement interface definitions. An interface may encompass one or more physical ports or may have a different definition.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The data service cards <b>84</b> include one or more network processors <b>88</b> configured to perform network processing on packets of data received via the I/O cards. The data service cards <b>84</b> also may include a CPU <b>90</b> configured to host applications such as a FIB agent <b>92</b> that may be used to program the network processing unit <b>88</b>. For example, the FIB agent <b>92</b> may be configured to program the NPU <b>88</b> to implement particular rules in the Forwarding Information Base <b>94</b>. The invention is not limited to the particular manner in which the data plane is architected, as many different data plane architects may be used to implement embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The VRF <b>62</b> and NRE <b>63</b> may implement processes to enable them to implement route updates to cause new routing information to be programmed into the data plane. For example, the NRE may include a MultiProtocol (MP) BGP process to advertise and receive advertised routs. The NRE may also include a Route Designator (RD) Task process which is configured to obtain the correct Virtual Router ID for a given import Route Target (RT) when a BGP route update is received.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The VRF <b>62</b> may include a RD Task process configured to filter routes by applying a per-VRF route import and route export policy. The RD Task may be configured to implement the export policy described above to implement an embodiment of the invention. The VRF also may include a Routing Protocol process configured to forward routing updates to the VPN sites <b>14</b> and receive route updates from the VPN sites. The VRF may also include a Real Time Manager process configured to manage the creation of interfaces on the network element.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the VRF includes a FIB Manager process that is configured to interface with a FIB agent <b>92</b> in the data plane to program the routes into the FIB in the data plane. By programming routes into the FIB, data that is received by the network element may be forwarded using the rules in the FIB.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Although a particular embodiment of a network element has been described, the invention is not limited in this manner as other types of network elements may be used as well. Accordingly, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is to be taken as illustrative only, and not to be interpreted as the only way of implementing the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an example of how the example network element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may handle routing updates received from a service provider's network to implement an embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when a route advertisement is received, it is sent to an MP-BGP process <b>200</b> in the NRE <b>63</b> (arrow <b>1</b>). The MP-BGP process receives MPBGP updates from its remote peer and applies global import policies to filter routes. Route updates, in this context, may be expected to have the format &#x3c;RD:prefix, BGP-nh, RT&#x3e; in which RD is the route distinguisher (enables uniqueness of IP route in the presence of overlapping IP addresses between VPN sites), BGP-nh is the next hop for the route, and RT is the route target. In a provider provisioned VPN, the route target is generally used to identify the VPN to which the route belongs. According to an embodiment of the invention, the RT of the route advertisement is used instead to identify the segregated area of a subscriber's VPN.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The MP-BGP process will then pass the route updates (arrow <b>2</b>) to the Route Designator task (RD-Task <b>204</b>). The RD-task uses the import route targets (RT) of the route updates in the BGP route advertisement to obtain the Virtual Router IDs (VrIDs) for the RTs of the route update. The RD-task then sends a request to the SubMgr <b>206</b> to retrieve the secure data channel interface IDs (SDC-IP-IfId(s)) for these VrIds (arrow <b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The SubMgr <b>80</b> uses the VrID as a key to look up the corresponding secure data channel Interface IDs (SDC-IP-IFIds), and replies with the list of SDC-IP-IfIds. If no corresponding SDC-IP-IfIds is found for a particular VrID, then no secure data channel exists for this route, and hence there is no corresponding VRF that should receive the route update. Accordingly, in this instance, the NRE will not forward the route to any VRF. Although an embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in which the RD-task accesses the SubMgr <b>206</b> to obtain a list of SDC-IP-IfIds, the invention is not limited in this manner as the RD-task may be configured to retain and dynamically update this list as well.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The RD task then filters the routes by applying a per-VRF VPN route import policy so that only those routes that the VRFs are supposed to learn about are forwarded to the VRFs. The RT-task will then replace the RT with the interface ID (SCD-IP-IfId) and forward the route to the appropriate VRF(s). The route, at this point, may be represented as &#x3c;RD:prefix, BGP-nh, SDC-IP-IfId&#x3e;, in which the RT values that were included in the original route updates have been replaced with the secure data channel interface IDs.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Routes forwarded by the VRF are received by RD-Task processes <b>210</b> in the VRFs <b>62</b>. Upon receipt of a route update, the RD task process will send the route to the Route Table Manager (RTM) process <b>214</b> which will interface a FIB manager process <b>216</b> to cause the route to be programmed into the forwarding tables. The FIB manager <b>216</b> will instruct a FIB agent <b>218</b> to program the VRF forwarding information base <b>220</b> in the network elements forwarding plane <b>222</b>, by causing the route to be programmed into the FIB in the forwarding plane. Thus, when subsequent packets are received that identify the route, the forwarding plane may forward those packets to the correct IPSec tunnel interface as defined by the SDC-IP-IfId associated with the route update. The route will also be passed to a routing protocol process <b>224</b> in the VRF that will announce the routes to those network elements on the VPN site that are part of the segment represented by the VRF according to the VRF's export policy.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a process that the network element may follow when it receives a local route from an attached VPN site. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the routing protocol process <b>224</b><i>a </i>receives a route, it will apply local import policy filters to the route before it is accepted. If accepted, the route will be passed to the RTM (arrow <b>1</b>) which will cause the route to be programmed into the forwarding plane by passing the route to the FIB manager <b>216</b><i>a </i>(arrow <b>2</b>). The FIB manager programs the route into the forwarding plane <b>220</b> via FIB agent <b>218</b> (arrow <b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The route will also be passed to the RD Task process <b>210</b><i>a </i>which will filter the routes based on export policy. If the route is to be advertised from the VRF, the RD task will send the route to the NRE process on the network element (arrow <b>4</b>). The route will be received by the RD task process <b>204</b> in the NRE and passed to the MP-BGP process <b>200</b> in the NRE (arrow <b>5</b>). The MP-BGP process <b>200</b> creates a route in MPBGP format, filters the routes by applying export policy, and then distributes the routes to remote VPN peers (arrow <b>6</b>). The RD-task process will also leak routes, if necessary, to other VRFs in the network element (arrow <b>7</b>). These other VRFs will follow a process similar to the one described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to cause the leaked routes to be programmed into their FIBs <b>220</b> in the forwarding plane <b>222</b>. Specifically, the RD-task processes in the other VRFs will apply per-VRF VPN route import policy and selectively downloading routes via their FIB manager to the FIB agent <b>218</b> so that they may be programmed into the forwarding plane.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a process that the network element may follow when transmitting a data packet from an attached VPN site onto the service provider's network. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when a packet is received (arrow <b>10</b>) the network element will apply inbound IP services, and the inbound IP interface will identify the specific VRF FIB for lookup for that packet. The packet will then be passed to the identified VRF FIB. After the packet has been filtered by the VRF FIB, the network element will apply tunnel IP services, encrypt the packet, and apply the outer IP header (arrow <b>11</b>). The format of the packet at this point is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The packet will then be passed to the NRE FIB, after which the network element will apply L2 encapsulation and send the packet to an outbound interface. The outbound interface will apply outbound IP services and forward the packet onto the service provider's IP network (arrow <b>12</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When a packet is received from the Service Providers IP network (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) the network element will apply inbound IP services and perform a lookup in the NRE FIB (arrow <b>15</b>). After the NRE FIB lookup, the network element will apply locally terminated IP services and perform a lookup in the global SPI (Service Provider Interface) table to determine the interface ID for the packet (arrow <b>16</b>). The network element will then decrypt the packet, strip off the outer IP header, and apply tunnel IP services (arrow <b>17</b>). The packet will be passed to the VRF FIB and then sent to the VPN Site (arrow <b>18</b>). As the packet is sent to the VPN site, the network element will apply L2 encapsulation and outbound IP services.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a process that the network element may follow when it receives a BGP route update (arrow <b>20</b>) from the NRE process via a VIP socket interface. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when a BGP-route update is received from the NRE process, the network element will apply locally originated IP services in the IP host. The network element will also perform IP Destination Address to Secure Control Channel IP Interface ID (SCC-IP-IfId) mapping (arrow <b>21</b>). Thus, based on the IP DA in the packet, the IP Host process will send the BGP packet to the SCC tunnel context for encryption and outbound processing (Arrow <b>21</b>). The network element will then apply outbound IP services, apply L2 encapsulation, and send the BGP route update on the outbound interface for the SCC (arrow <b>22</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a process that the network element may follow when it receives a routing update from the service provider's network. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when a control packet is received from the service provider's network, inbound IP services are applied and the network element will perform a lookup in the NRE FIB (arrow <b>25</b>). The network element will then perform a lookup in the global SPI table to determine the Interface ID (arrow <b>26</b>). The network element then will decrypt the packet and strip off the outer IP header and apply tunnel IP services (arrow <b>27</b>). Then, locally terminated IP services will be applied to the packet in the IP host and the packet will be sent to the NRE process. The BGP route update will then be sent to the NRE process via the VIP socket interface.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> have provided several specific examples of how a network element, such as the network element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, may handle data packets and routing updates. The invention is not limited to the particular example processes illustrated in these Figures, however, since other network elements that are differently configured may handle data and routing packets differently according to their particular architecture.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-151891, filed May 21, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method of displaying a three-dimensional image, a method of capturing a three-dimensional image, and an apparatus that displays a three-dimensional image.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various systems are known for apparatuses that display three-dimensional images, i.e. stereoscopic images, and that can display motion pictures, that is, three-dimensional displays. In recent years, there has been a growing demand particularly for a system of a flat panel type which does not require the use of specific viewing exclusive glasses or the like. Some three-dimensional motion picture display apparatuses of this kind utilize the principle of holography, which is difficult to put into practical use. In a known system that can display three-dimensional images relatively easily, a parallax barrier (also referred to as a ray control element) is installed immediately before a direct-vision or projection type display apparatus, for example, a display panel (display apparatus) such as a liquid crystal display apparatus or a plasma display apparatus which has fixed pixel positions; the parallax barrier controls light rays from the display panel so that the rays are directed to an observer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The parallax barrier controls light rays so that different images can be viewed even at the same position on the parallax barrier by varying angle. Specifically, a slit or a lenticular sheet (cylindrical lens array) is used to provide only lateral parallax (horizontal parallax). A pinhole array or a lens array is used to provide vertical parallax in addition to lateral parallax. Systems using the parallax barrier are further classified into a binocular system, a multiview system, a super-multiview system (a multiview system to which super-multiview conditions are added), and an integral imaging system (simply referred to as an II system below). The basic principle of these systems is substantially the same as that of a system invented about ten years earlier and used for three-dimensional photographs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The integral imaging system (II system) is described using terms for three-dimensional photography. Accordingly, some documents refer to it as integral photography (also referred to as IP below).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The II system is characterized by having a high degree of freedom for a viewpoint position and enabling easy three-dimensional viewing. A display apparatus with a high resolution can be relatively easily implemented using an II system having only horizontal parallax and not having vertical parallax (simply referred to as a one-dimensional II system or 1D-II system). In contrast, the binocular or multiview system provides only a narrow range of viewpoint positions at which the observer can three-dimensionally view images, that is, a narrow viewing area. Thus, disadvantageously, this system fails to allow the observer to see images easily. However, the binocular or multiview system is the simplest configuration for three-dimensional image display apparatuses. This system also has the advantage of allowing display images to be easily created.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, the difference between the II system and the lenticular sheet (LS) system is a plane on which pixels are present, that is, an image plane or a focal plane. However, in a practical design, particularly with a large number of pixels, the difference between the image plane and the focal plane is at most 0.1 mm even without any aberration. It is thus difficult to distinguish the image plane from the focal plane owing to a limit on accuracy. It is also difficult to determine whether light rays are converged at a viewing distance, owing to the limit on accuracy. The term II system, as used in the specification, means a system which does not involve the distinction based on the pixel position on the image plane and on the focal plane but which uses an arbitrary (continuous) lateral (substantially horizontal) viewpoint position at which a normal three-dimensional image is visible at the viewing distance. Further, the term multiview system means a system which is not equivalent to the LS system (does not require the convergence of light rays) and with which at the viewing distance, the normal three-dimensional image is visible at a lateral viewpoint position determined on the basis of interocular distance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With either the II system or the multiview system, the viewing distance is normally finite. Accordingly, a display image is created so that a perspective projection image at that viewing distance is actually visible. With the II system providing only horizontal parallax and not providing vertical parallax, if the horizontal pitch of the parallax barrier is an integral multiple of the horizontal pitch of the pixel, a set of parallel rays is produced (referred to as parallel-ray II below). Further, the parallel-ray II system provides a correctly projected three-dimensional image by displaying on a display surface a parallax interleaved image obtained by dividing a parallax component image into pieces corresponding to respective pixel arrays, the parallax component image having been perspectively projected at a specified viewing distance in the vertical direction and orthographically projected in the horizontal direction, and then appropriately arranging the pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is difficult to implement an image capture apparatus that photographs images by varying the projection method and projection central distance between the vertical direction and the horizontal direction because in particular, orthographic projection requires a camera or lens having the same size as that of a subject. Accordingly, to obtain orthographic projection data through image capture, it is practical to convert perspective projection image capture data into divided and arranged image data. In addition, for example, a method is known which interpolates image data using EPI (epipolar plane image).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the II system, as disclosed in J. Opt. Soc. Am. A vol. 15, p. 2059 (1998), the front- and rear-side reproducible ranges of a three-dimensional image display apparatus are relatively narrow; typical values are about 10 cm in each direction. However, to eliminate restrictions on the position of an object to be displayed, it is necessary to increase the degree of freedom in the front- and rear-side reproducible ranges of the three-dimensional image display apparatus. Some multiview systems that synthesize perspective projection images to form a three-dimensional image display perspective-projection three-dimensional images in which the front and rear sides are emphasized (three-dimensional images which are compressed in a rear-side direction and which have nulls close to the camera). However, with the parallel-ray II system that forms orthographic projection images into a three-dimensional image, no three-dimensional images such as those described above have been created and no methods for creating such images have been found.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The parallel-ray II system advantageously provides easier-to-see images than the binocular system. However, the parallel-ray II system uses a complicated image format in terms of the projection method or division and arrangement method. The binocular and multiview system performs the simplest display of three-dimensional images and thus uses a simple image format. For actual photographing, it is possible to combine parallax component images captured using two cameras arranged in the horizontal direction, as they are. Since some stereoscopic contents are intended for the binocular system, a display apparatus for the parallel-ray II system can desirably deal with a perspective-projection two-image image format, that is, desirably has upward compatibility. To deal with this format, it is possible to interpolate binocular data to display easy-to-see images for the II system. However, it is difficult to interpolate or extrapolate a large number of instances of parallax component images on the basis of a small number of, i.e., two parallax component images for the binocular system. No known methods enable a display apparatus for the parallel-ray II system to display binocular data substantially as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As described above, the conventional three-dimensional image display apparatus for the parallel-ray II system fails to appropriately deal with stereoscopic contents in a variety of image formats, particularly contents obtained through perspective projection.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With reference to the drawings, a detailed description will be given of a three-dimensional image display apparatus and method according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The term &#x201c;column&#x201d; as used in the specification refers to a minimum unit column of pixels in a horizontal direction. The column refers to a sub-pixel row in a normal liquid crystal display apparatus in which each pixel is divided into sub-pixels of three colors (R, G, and B) arranged in the horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">First, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, description will be given of a procedure of displaying a three-dimensional image in three modes in a three-dimensional image display apparatus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show a flowchart and a block diagram applied to a three-dimensional image display apparatus and method according to the embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a process by which a display module (display) for a parallel-ray II system can display a three-dimensional image in any of a (e) normal display mode, a (b) compressed and emphasized display mode, and a (c) binocular and multiview compatible display mode.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The block diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> corresponds to the flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the configuration of a display apparatus that can display a three-dimensional image in any of the (e) normal display mode; the (b) compressed and emphasized display mode, and the (c) binocular and multiview compatible display mode.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in the tables in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, in the normal display mode, image data for the II system (parallax component image data created on the basis of the parallel-ray II system and indicating a parallax component image orthographically projected in the horizontal direction and perspectively projected in the vertical direction) is distributed in the display module for the II system in accordance with a parallax image arrangement table for the II system to display a three-dimensional image. In the compressed and emphasized display mode, the following data are distributed in the display module for the II system in accordance with the parallax image arrangement table for the II system to display a three-dimensional image in which the front and rear sides are compressed with the vertical and horizontal directions emphasized (nulls are close to the camera): multiview data with a large number of instances of parallax and parallax component image data indicating a parallax component image prospectively projected in both horizontal and vertical directions. In the binocular and multiview compatible display mode, multiview data with a small number of instances of parallax is distributed in the display module for the II system in accordance with a multiview compatible parallax image arrangement table to display a three-dimensional image. As already described, the term II system, as used in the specification, means that at a viewing distance, a normal three-dimensional image is visible at an arbitrary (continuous) lateral (substantially horizontal) viewpoint position. The term binocular and multiview system means that at the viewing distance, the normal three-dimensional image is visible at a lateral viewpoint position determined on the basis of interocular distance (this viewpoint position involves multiple viewpoints and is discrete).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The parallax arrangement table shows how parallax component images are arranged in elemental images of a parallax interleaved image (consisting of a large number of elemental images) displayed on a display surface. The II system parallax image arrangement table differs from the multiview compatible parallax image arrangement table in the arrangement range or interval of the same parallax data (a parallax component image, that is, an image projected at a single camera position) on the display surface and the number of columns occupying each elemental image, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, with the II system parallax image arrangement and the multiview compatible parallax image arrangement, the elemental images have common positions and widths (as long as observation standard viewing distance is fixed); the only difference is a method of rearranging parallax components images in elemental images. If optical apertures in slits or lenses are shaped like vertical stripes, rows have the same parallax arrangement (however, if a color filter array varies depending on the rows, only the color component varies). Accordingly, a procedure of dividing a parallax component image into pieces corresponding to respective columns and arranging the pieces in a parallax interleaved image can be collectively executed on one column (on all the rows). If the optical apertures have oblique or other complicated shapes or pixels are arranged on the display surface in a delta array, the parallax arrangement varies depending on the rows. However, the same parallax arrangement is used for rows for which the horizontal positions of the optical apertures and the pixel positions have the same vertical position relationship. Consequently, the procedure of dividing a parallax component image into pieces corresponding to respective columns and arranging the pieces in a parallax interleaved image can be collectively executed on the rows with the same vertical position relation-ships. Thus, the parallax arrangement tables determine pixel rows to be arranged in the vertical direction of a display module <b>331</b> as well as columns to be arranged in the horizontal direction of the display module <b>331</b>. Parallax component image data is distributively arranged in the determined pixel rows and columns.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a parallax arrangement table for a common multiview system three-dimensional display apparatus as a comparative example. A hardware configuration (the relationship between parallax barrier pitch and pixel width) and the positions and widths of elemental images according to the comparative example are different from those according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in the flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the block diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an image signal for a three-dimensional image (3D image signal) starts to be input by a signal source <b>101</b> as shown in step S<b>11</b>. Then, the apparatus first determines whether image data contained in this image signal is binocular or multiview image data with a small number of instances of parallax (a determining <b>102</b> and step S<b>12</b>). The 3D image signal is obtained by synthesizing parallax component images constituting one frame of display image, in a certain format. This format can be used for the determination. If the image data contained in the image signal is binocular or multiview image data with a small number of instances of parallax, a multiview image processing <b>105</b> processes the image data (step S<b>13</b>) and distributes parallax component images in accordance with the multiview compatible arrangement table (step S<b>13</b><i>c</i>). The display module <b>331</b> then displays the images (step S<b>21</b>). Specifically, as described later in detail, the same parallax component image is provided for a plurality of image column groups. A display in black or a predetermined color is provided in the columns in the column groups provided with the same parallax component image. For an II display apparatus in which a horizontal resolution determined by the horizontal pitch of slits or lenses differs from the maximum vertical resolution determined by the vertical pixel pitch of the display module, if the horizontal and vertical resolutions for input binocular or multiview data differ from those of the II display apparatus, the resolutions are converted as required (steps S<b>13</b><i>a </i>and S<b>13</b><i>b</i>). On the basis of the arrangement of the parallax component image data, a parallax interleaved image is two-dimensionally displayed in the display module <b>331</b>. The parallax interleaved image is then passed through a parallax barrier to allow an observer to observe a three-dimensional image according to the multiview system in front of the apparatus. Whether the number of instances of parallax in the multiview data is large or small means whether or not it is at least about half the number of instances of parallax (parallax barrier horizontal pitch/sub pixel horizontal pitch) in II display provided by a three-dimensional display apparatus intrinsically designed for the II display. If the number of instances of parallax in the multiview data is at least about half that in the II display, it is relatively easy to increase viewpoints by using parallax interpolation. Accordingly, the interpolated II parallax arrangement table is suitably used in the compressed and emphasized display mode. In contrast, the use of the binocular and multiview compatible display mode is not suitable because this may cause marked vertical-band-like area separations. If the number of instances of parallax in the multiview data is not at least about half that in the II display, the binocular and multiview compatible display mode is suitable because it is difficult to increase viewpoints by using parallax interpolation.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In step S<b>12</b>, if the image data is multiview image data with a large number of instances of parallax or is intended for the II system, the determining section <b>102</b> determines in step S<b>16</b> whether the image data is to be displayed in the compressed and emphasized display mode or is perspective projection multiview data. If neither case is true, for example, if the image data is intended for the II system and is normally displayed using the II system, then a normal processing <b>103</b> executes a normal process in step S<b>17</b>. The determining section <b>103</b> determines in step S<b>17</b><i>a </i>whether or not the II system image data requires interpolation. The required number of instances of parallax is determined on the basis of the configuration of the parallel-ray 1D-II system display apparatus (how many times the parallax barrier horizontal pitch is as large as the column pitch) and observation standard viewing distance. If interpolation or resizing is required, for example, if the number of instances of parallax in the input data is smaller than the intrinsically required value, interpolated or extrapolated parallax component image information is obtained on the basis of adjacent parallax to create image data having the interpolated or extrapolated parallax components (step S<b>17</b><i>b</i>). Alternatively, for an II display apparatus in which the horizontal resolution determined by the horizontal pitch of slits or lenses differs from the maximum vertical resolution determined by the vertical pixel pitch of the display module, if the horizontal and vertical resolutions for input II data differ from those of the II display apparatus, the resolutions are converted as required (steps S<b>17</b><i>c </i>and S<b>17</b><i>d</i>). Subsequently, the parallax component images are distributed in accordance with the 1D-II arrangement table (step S<b>17</b><i>e</i>). A parallax interleaved image is then displayed in the display module <b>331</b> (step S<b>21</b>). As a result, a three-dimensional image is formed via the parallax barrier so as to have a continuous parallax from a front-side direction (an area closer to the observer with respect to the apparatus) to a rear-side direction (an area located behind the apparatus and opposite the observer) of the apparatus. The three-dimensional image is observed by the observer.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In step S<b>16</b>, if the image data must be displayed in the compressed and emphasized mode or is perspective projection multiview data, an emphasis processing section <b>104</b> executes a compressed and emphasized display process as shown in step S<b>18</b>. Here, the compressed and emphasized display is required when the subject has such a front and rear sides&#x2014;as prevent a subject image actually obtained by photographing from being clearly displayed in a space located in front of the apparatus and behind the apparatus as described later. In this case, perspective projection parallax component image data corresponding to the subject image is interpolated and has its resolution converted as required so that a camera interval (photographing interval) is smaller than a corresponding standard condition and so that the subject is photographed as in the case of the use of a wide-angle lens. The data is thus converted into image data suitable for the compressed and emphasized display (steps S<b>18</b><i>a </i>to S<b>18</b><i>e</i>). The converted parallax component images are distributed in accordance with the 1D-II arrangement table (step S<b>18</b><i>f</i>). A parallax interleaved image is displayed in the display module <b>331</b> (step S<b>21</b>). As a result, a three-dimensional image is clearly observed which has been compressed in the areas within the front- and rear-side limit distances from the apparatus and which has been emphasized in the vertical and horizontal directions. When the compression ratio is maximized in the compression and emphasis process, the image data is converted into planar data (two-dimensional data) that does not display the rear-side direction of the subject. If such converted image data is provided to the display module <b>331</b>, the three-dimensional image is not displayed but only a simple two-dimensional image (two-dimensionally projected image) is displayed. In this sense, the compression and emphasis process includes not only the compression of the subject image in a longitudinal direction but also a conversion into a two-dimensional image. The conversion uses a substantially one parallax component image as all parallax component images.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the image data input to the apparatus, a three-dimensional image signal shown in step S<b>11</b> may be accompanied by object data or positional data on the subject which can be referenced (step S<b>19</b>). In this case, the range of the object is detected in accordance with a direction in which the object is to be displayed. The data on the range is extracted. The existence range information is transmitted to the processing in steps S<b>16</b> and S<b>18</b> (step S<b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the above process, the determination for binocular and multiview data in step S<b>12</b> is based on the attribute or format of the data. However, the determination may be pre-specified by a mode selection instruction using a mode switch <b>111</b> (step S<b>22</b>). For example, if an image is displayed during actual photographing, a photographer may specify the use of binocular and multiview data. Alternatively, if three-dimensional image data is stored in a medium, a mode switch signal may be generated when the medium is installed in a drive device. This eliminates the need for the determination in step S<b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Alternatively, the determination in step S<b>16</b> may be similarly pre-specified by a mode selection instruction using the mode switch <b>111</b> (step S<b>22</b>).

<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a normal (standard condition) camera interval P intrinsically determined from the apparatus configuration. The normal (standard condition) camera distance (the distance between the projection plane and the camera located in front of the projection plane) is the same as an observation standard viewing distance L. The normal (standard condition) camera interval P is determined by the pixel pitch Pp and observation standard viewing distance L on a display screen with respect to the projection plane <b>422</b>, as well as the gap d between the display surface and each optical aperture in the parallax barrier. In this case, d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is drawn on the assumption that the medium is entirely composed of air and that a principal ray is not refracted. However, if a glass substrate or lens is used, its refractive index causes the principal ray to be refracted. Consequently, in actual dimensions, d has a converted value. The observation standard viewing distance L determines the width of elemental images (the division and arrangement table for parallax component images). If the screen size of the display module is different from the size of an actual photographing plane (projection plane) range, L and P are increased or reduced in proportion to that ratio. The results are a standard camera distance and a standard camera interval for actual photographing. This also applies to a front- and rear-side limit distances zn and zf described later. If the screen size of the display module is different from the size of the actual photographing plane (projection plane) range, zn and zf are increased or reduced in proportion to that ratio. The results are limit distances for actual photographing. A horizontal interval for projection and photographing for each parallax is determined to be a photographing standard condition on the basis of horizontal intervals for the positions at which the pixels are projected via the parallax barrier at the observation standard viewing distance.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If setting is made so that the image is compressed by a factor of b in the depth direction using wide-angle perspective projection in the compressed and emphasized display mode, the following conditions are required. (1) The subject is photographed using perspective projection, in both vertical and horizontal directions. That is, the subject is photographed using the normal perspective projection camera <b>429</b> as well as perspective projection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. (2) A camera distance L&#x2032; is set to be q (in most cases, q&#x3c;1 but q&#x3e;=1 is allowed) times as long as the observation standard viewing distance (standard camera distance) L. In other words, the subject <b>421</b> is photographed as in the case of the use of a wide-angle lens as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. (3) A camera interval P&#x2032; for each parallax component is set smaller than q/b of the standard camera interval P (P&#x2032;&#x3c;=P&#xb7;q/b). This process suppresses the blur and distortion of a displayed three-dimensional image. (4) A table used to arrange parallax component images on the display surface is created on the basis of the width of the elemental images calculated using the observation standard viewing distance L.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">A simple description will be given of derivation of conditional expressions based on these conditions. To simplify the forms of the conditional expressions, the observation standard viewing distance (standard camera distance) and the position of the camera in front of the subject are set at 1 and (0, 0, 1), respectively, with the projection plane defined as an xy plane. The generality of the conditional expressions is not lost even under this assumption. Two perspective projection cameras <b>429</b> inherently projects the coordinates (x1, y1, z1) of the subject at (xr1, yr1, 0) and (xl1, yl1, 0) on the projection plane. However, for emphasis, the camera interval and distance are multiplied by a and q, respectively, (a&#x3c;q&#x3c;=1) to project the coordinates at (xr2, yr2, 0) and (xl2, yl2, 0). Then, the image is reproduced as if it were projected with the camera interval P and the camera distance of 1. Consequently, the three-dimensional image appears to be at (x2, y2, z2). In the case of reproduction with light rays for the perspective projection camera <b>429</b> (multiview), transformations are as follows.

That is, a three-dimensional image free from distortion or blur can be displayed by setting the ratio a of the camera interval P&#x2032; to P to at most q/b. Reducing the camera interval P&#x2032; below the intrinsic value P and the ratio a of P&#x2032; to P from q/b toward zero means that the image gets closer to a two-dimensional one.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> are graphs showing the relation-ship between a, b, q, zn, and zf (depth reproduction area) based on the above calculations. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, the axis of abscissa indicates depth direction compression ratio b. The axis of ordinate indicates a coefficient a for the camera interval. The thick solid line indicates a=q/b. The solid line (1D-IP (front)) shows a curve for the front-side area. The dashed line (1D-IP (rear)) shows a curve for the rear-side area. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows a case for zn/L=0.05 and q=0.3. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows a case for zn/L=0.05 and q=1.0. As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, a reduction in camera interval (in coefficient a) increases the z coordinate zf of the rear-side limit compared to the z coordinate zn of the front-side limit. For example, for an observation standard viewing distance of 0.7 m (=L), a camera distance of 0.21 m (=Lq), and a front-side reproduction area of 0.035 m (=zn=Lzn0), q=0.3, zn0=+0.05, and b=2 are set (an image with a front-side amount of +0.07 m is to be compressively displayed). Then, as shown by the dashed arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the camera interval may be set within the range a&#x3c;=q/b=0.15. Setting a=0.1 as shown by the solid arrow ensures that blur and distortion can be suppressed in the front-side area and prevents the loss of stereoscopic effect. In this case, in the rear-side direction, the rear-side area can be displayed without blur up to b=3, that is, up to &#x2212;0.105 m. In another example, for an observation standard viewing distance of 0.7 m (=L), a camera distance of 0.7 m (=Lq), and a front-side reproduction area of 0.035 m (=zn=Lzn0), q=1, zn0=+0.05, and b=3 are set (an image with a front-side amount of +0.105 m is to be compressively displayed). Then, as shown by the solid arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the camera interval may be set within the range a&#x3c;=q/b=0.33. Setting a=0.29 as shown by the solid arrow ensures that blur and distortion can be suppressed in the front-side area and prevents the loss of stereoscopic effect. In this case, in the rear-side direction, the rear-side area can be displayed without blur up to b=4, that is, up to &#x2212;0.14 m.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The actual camera distance with respect to the observation standard viewing distance L is arbitrary. The rate q of the camera distance to L may be equal to or larger than 1. This condition includes a camera interval P&#x2032; of zero, which corresponds to a 2D display mode with a perspective projection image without any parallax (q: arbitrary, b: infinite).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The above method makes it possible to display a three-dimensional image with little distortion or blur observed or with its three-dimensionality emphasized, on the II system display, by directly displaying perspective projection image data without converting the image data into orthographic projection data in the horizontal direction. Since the perspective projection data can be utilized as it is and can thus be processed at high speed, the above method is suitable for displaying actually photographed images, in particular, in real time. Accordingly, the compressed and emphasized display mode can always be utilized in order to display actually photographed data.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the compressed and emphasized display mode, three-dimensionality is emphasized so that the size of the front side is increased in the vertical and horizontal direction while the size of the rear side is reduced in the vertical and horizontal directions. Enlargement and reduction rate is almost equal in the vertical direction and in the horizontal direction. However, strictly speaking, on the front side, the rate is slightly larger in the horizontal direction. On the rear side, the rate is slightly larger in the vertical direction. Accordingly, distortion can be corrected by displaying a parallax interleaved image enlarged by about several to several tens of percents in the vertical direction if the image contains a large number of front-side objects, or displaying a parallax interleaved image reduced by about several percents in the vertical direction if the image contains only rear-side objects. The parallax interleaved image may be enlarged or reduced in the vertical direction by for example, adjusting the size of the projection plane when a parallax component image is created or the enlargement or reduction may be carried out during the resolution conversion in S<b>18</b> (compressed and emphasized display process) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The standard camera interval is also equal to the ray interval (the interval between two light rays from horizontally adjacent pixels if the optical apertures are shaped like vertical stripes) of the II three-dimensional system display apparatus. However, a smaller ray interval enables distortion to be more easily prevented. A reduction in observation standard viewing distance also enables distortion to be more easily prevented because it reduces the ray interval. However, a decrease in ray interval reduces the viewing area width (the product of the ray interval and the number of instances of parallax) over which the observer can observe a normal three-dimensional image. It is thus necessary to ensure a minimum viewing area width of about 100 to 200 mm (the width is increased if much crosstalk occurs), which is somewhat larger than the interocular distance; the ray interval cannot be set too smaller. For some applications, the size of the projection plane may be varied so that the projection plane at the front-side limit position (front projection plane) always has the same size or width. This prevents a front-side subject from protruding from the screen. However, the size of the protruding subject remains unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> show, by way of example, how to vary camera interval P, camera distance L (Lx denotes the horizontal direction and Ly denotes the vertical direction), and depth of field Df in order to continuously switch from the compressed and emphasized display mode to the normal display mode. Left of the dashed line corresponds to the compressed and emphasized display mode. Right of the dashed line corresponds to the normal display mode. The arrows represent temporal steps for the continuous switching (the reverse temporal steps are also possible). If the camera interval P is not changed before switching the mode, a change in image (apparent movement of the coordinates) is slightly marked. When a compressed and emphasized display mode with a much reduced camera interval P (corresponding to an area located front and on the left of the dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>) is interposed in order to suppress the change in image, the resolution increases only at this point. This appears slightly unnatural. Accordingly, by reducing the depth of field Df of the camera <b>429</b> only at this point to blur the image, it is possible to accomplish continuous, natural switching. An example of this method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> and is suitable for actual photographing. Another method is to project the image using a camera <b>429</b> that continuously (independently of the vertical direction) change from orthographic projection (perspective projection at an infinite viewing distance) to perspective projection (perspective projection at a finite viewing distance). This method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(B)</figref> and is suitable for computer graphics.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>) is a table showing an example in which binocular data arrangement widths and intervals are distributed in an elemental image in the binocular and multiview compatible display mode with an II system display. This distribution is determined taking into account the ray interval between adjacent pixels (horizontally adjacent pixels for optical apertures shaped like vertical stripes or pixels corresponding to adjacent parallax for oblique optical apertures) and the interocular distance. However, with the II system, crosstalk (the mixture, in one cylindrical lens, of light rays from the adjacent pixels) may occur between the adjacent pixels. Accordingly, for the binocular and multiview compatible display, the same parallax component data must be provided for at least three columns. In examples 2-1 to 2-13 in the table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>), the number of instances of parallax, the observation standard viewing distance, and the adjacent parallax ray interval at the observation standard viewing distance are assumed to be 18, 700 mm, and 17 mm, respectively. The same parallax component data is provided for three to nine columns. Furthermore, in order to prevent crosstalk with a right and left parallax component images, it may be desirable to place a black (or monochromatic) column in the center. In particular, with the binocular system, when the unwanted columns located at the opposite ends and corresponding to elemental image boundaries are shown in black, reverse three-dimensional (pseudoscopic) viewing is advantageously prevented. Further, it is advantageously easy to determine a deviation from the viewing area. The black columns have two types of widths because the elemental images for the II system intrinsically have two types of widths. In connection with the design of an II system three-dimensional display apparatus, a smaller ray interval allows lateral inter-parallax crosstalk to be more easily prevented for the binocular display. A reduction in observation standard viewing distance also enables crosstalk to be more easily prevented because it reduces the ray interval. The black display parts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> need not be black but are preferably white provided that the original image is based on black. These parts may have a color complementary to that on which the entire image is based (average color). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows an example of the distribution of column numbers in an elemental image for a four-eye system as an example of the multiview compatible system.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> are kinds of parallax arrangement tables. Providing these tables with data on elemental image width results in a sufficient amount of information for multiview compatible arrangement tables. That is, all the parallax components can be arranged all over the display surface on the basis of the tables. As described later, an II parallax arrangement table has a different form as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, owing to its different arrangement regularity.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Even if cylindrical lenses in a lenticular sheet extend obliquely, the binocular and multiview compatible display mode can be implemented by using a method similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, for each row. The oblique lenticular sheet requires more complicated processing. However, a decrease in vertical resolution enables the horizontal resolution to be assigned to the vertical direction. Even if the cylindrical lenses in the lenticular sheet extend in the vertical direction and the pixels are arranged in a delta array, the binocular and multiview compatible display mode can be implemented by using a similar method of each row. For the delta array, a black (or monochromatic) column is particularly desirably placed between right and left instances of parallax.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The above method enables binocular and multiview data to be displayed in the compatible mode using the II system display.

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Either with the II system or with the multiview system, the viewing distance is normally finite. Consequently, a display image, that is, a parallax interleaved image, is created so that the perspective projection image at the observation standard viewing distance is actually visible. In general, the perspective projection image is created by executing image processing (rendering for computer graphics) for each cross point at which a straight line joining a pixel and a slit together passes through a horizontal line (viewpoint height position) on an observation standard viewing distance plane. In this case, the perspective projection image may be created for each pixel and for each cross point (viewpoint) at which a plane joining a column, instead of the pixel, and a slit together crosses a horizontal line on the observation standard viewing distance plane.</p>

The parallax barrier <b>332</b> is composed of the lenticular sheet <b>334</b> or slit <b>333</b>, which is shaped so that for example, optical apertures extend linearly in the vertical direction and are periodically arranged in the horizontal direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>. With the three-dimensional image display apparatus, within the range of a horizontal viewing angle <b>341</b> and a vertical viewing angle <b>342</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the observer can observe three-dimensional images in spaces in front of (closer to the observer) and behind the two-dimensional image display module <b>331</b>, from the position of his or her eyes via the parallax barrier <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In this case, it is assumed that if minimum unit pixel groups each forming a square is counted, the two-dimensional image display module <b>331</b> have, for example, 1,920 pixels in the horizontal direction and 1,200 pixels in the vertical direction. Further, each minimum unit pixel group is assumed to contain red (R), green (G), and blue (B) pixels (sub-pixels).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, once the viewing distance L between the parallax barrier <b>332</b> and the observation standard viewing distance plane <b>343</b>, the parallax barrier pitch Ps, and the parallax barrier gap d are determined, the pitch Pe of the elemental images is determined by the interval between a viewpoint on the viewing distance plane <b>343</b> and the center of each optical aperture (exit pupil, slit, or lens) projected on the display surface. Reference numeral <b>346</b> denotes a straight line joining a viewpoint position on the observation standard viewing distance L and the center of each aperture. The viewing area width W is determined on the basis of the condition that the elemental images do not overlap one another on the display surface in the display apparatus. Even if the refractive index of the medium in the parallax barrier or display apparatus causes light rays to be refracted, the straight lines <b>346</b> are considered to be light rays and P, e, and W are similarly determined taking refraction into account.

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">It should be noted that with a one-dimensional II system, the straight line <b>346</b> does not always pass through the center of each pixel on the display surface of the display apparatus.

The line coincides with the locus of a light ray. If the horizontal pitch Ps of the apertures is an integral multiple of the horizontal pitch of the pixels, the pitch Pe of the elemental images has a fraction that makes the pitch Pe deviate markedly from the integral multiple of the pixel pitch Pp. Even if the horizontal pitch of the apertures is not an integral multiple of the pixel pitch Pp, with the one-dimensional II system, the pitch Pe of the elemental images has a fraction that makes the pitch Pp deviate from the integral multiple of the pixel pitch Pp. In contrast, with the multiview system, the pitch Pe of the elemental images is an integral multiple of the pixel pitch Pp.</p>

An object (subject) <b>421</b> to be displayed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> is projected on a projection plane <b>422</b> at the same position as that of a plane in which the parallax barrier <b>332</b> of the three-dimensional display apparatus is placed. In this case, in the normal mode, the object <b>421</b> is subjected to perspective projection (simply referred to as pers in the drawings) in the vertical direction and to orthographic projection (simply referred to as ortho in the drawings) in the horizontal direction. Consequently, an image <b>424</b> of the subject <b>421</b> is created on the projection plane <b>424</b>; the image <b>424</b> has been subjected to perspective projection in the vertical direction and to orthographic projection in the horizontal direction. In this case, projection lines <b>425</b> do not cross in the horizontal direction but cross a projection central line <b>423</b> in the vertical direction; the projection central line <b>423</b> is present in the observation standard viewing distance plane. Further, as is apparent from its projection method, the projection central line <b>423</b> is extended along and parallel to the projection plane <b>422</b>. In principle, the projection central line <b>423</b> lies opposite the center of the projection plane <b>422</b> in the vertical direction. This projection method is similar to a rasterizing and rendering operations in commercially available three-dimensional computer graphics creating software except that the projection method varies between the vertical direction and the horizontal direction. A normal located in the center of the projection plane <b>422</b> normally crosses the projection central line <b>423</b>. However, the normal need not cross the projection central line <b>423</b> if for example, the projection plane <b>422</b> of the resulting three-dimensional image is to be located vertical to a floor surface so that the observer can look down at the floor surface and the subject <b>421</b> on it.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows an example of a parallax arrangement table for a typical multiview display apparatus that is not the present invention but is a comparative example; the multiview display apparatus has the same number of instances of parallax as that according to the present invention and has a common configuration in which the elemental image pitch is an integral multiple of the pixel pitch. As shown in the table, parallax component images are uniformly arranged on the display surface (entire parallax interleaved image).

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the lenticular sheet <b>334</b> is placed in front of a display surface such as a liquid crystal panel which two-dimensionally displays a parallax image, the lenticular sheet <b>334</b> includes a large number of cylindrical lenses, each having a major axis which extends in the vertical direction, and serves as a parallax barrier having optical apertures. The optical apertures may be obliquely extended or formed like steps. Pixels <b>32</b> each having an aspect ratio of 3:1 are arranged in matrix along the horizontal and vertical directions. In the same pixel row and in the same column, red, green, and blue pixels are alternately arranged. The arrangement of pixels (sub-pixels in a typical liquid crystal display apparatus) is generally called a mosaic array. Reference numeral <b>43</b> denotes an effective pixel that is a unit used to distribute <b>18</b> parallax component images when a three-dimensional image is displayed (one effective pixel <b>43</b> is shown by the black frame in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The effective pixel may be a square as shown in this example or a rectangle (obtained by dividing the square <b>43</b> into two in the vertical direction) having a vertical resolution double that of the square <b>43</b> so as to comply to the minimum vertical period (the period of R, G, and B).</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the parallax number &#x2212;10 appears before the lens number &#x2212;10 and the parallax number 10 appears after the lens number 10. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, showing the parallax numbers &#x2212;9 to 9, corresponds to the lens numbers &#x2212;9 to &#x2212;1 and 1 to 9. The adjacent parallax numbers are assigned to adjacent columns. The vertical period of the pixel rows is set triple the horizontal period Pp of the columns. Each pixel <b>34</b> has a pixel opening or light emitting pixel portion with a specified area ratio. The pixel opening is surrounded by a black matrix <b>35</b>. In this manner, the pixel openings and the black matrices <b>35</b> constitute a pixel period in the horizontal direction. Thus, the lenticular sheet <b>334</b>, placed in front of the display surface, has optical apertures arranged at a horizontal period that is an integral multiple of the pixel period Pp. That is, the cylindrical lenses in the lenticular sheet are arranged so that the optical axes of the lenses are located at positions corresponding to integral multiples of the pixel period Pp. If the parallax barrier <b>332</b> having optical apertures is a slit instead of the lenticular sheet, the central axes of the optical apertures are located at positions corresponding to integral multiples of the pixel period Pp.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">With respect to the entire display screen, this integral multiple arrangement may result in moir&#xe9; or color moir&#xe9;. To suppress the moir&#xe9;, the diffusion layer provided in the surface of the polarizing plate may execute a diffusion process (haze) more effective than that executed by a diffusion layer provided in the surface of a polarizing plate in a typical liquid crystal display apparatus in order to prevent mirror reflection. The diffusion layer may be integrated with the surface of the polarizing plate of the liquid crystal display apparatus or with a back surface of the lenticular sheet or may beam independent diffusion sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">With the arrangement of the display module, in which the pixels <b>34</b> in 18 columns and 6 rows constitute one effective pixel <b>43</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, it is possible to display a three-dimensional image while providing 18 parallax in the horizontal direction. This display arrangement provides 18 viewpoints in case of the multiview system. An elemental image displayed in the effective pixel <b>43</b> has a pitch of 18 pixels and the horizontal pitch of the parallax barrier is smaller than 18 pixels in case of the multiview system.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">For the II system, an elemental image is similarly displayed in the effective image <b>43</b>. Further, for example, the parallax barrier pitch Ps is equal to 18 pixels so as to provide a set of parallel rays. With this II system design, elemental image boundaries occur at intervals of slightly larger than 18 pixels (for example, 18.02). Accordingly, the width of the effective pixel is equal to 18 or 19 columns depending on a position in the display surface. That is, the average of the elemental image pitches is larger than the width Pp of 18 pixels. Further, the horizontal pitch of the parallax barrier <b>332</b> is equal to 18 pixels. The effective pixel <b>43</b> has an aspect ratio of 1:1 and has a square arrangement. Consequently, the vertical direction can be displayed using substantially the same effective resolution as that in the horizontal direction.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, both parallax numbers &#x2212;10 and 9 appear only at the lens number &#x2212;10.

That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows an example in which the width of the effective pixel is equal to 19 columns. Thus, with the II system, some effective pixels (elemental images) have a width equal to 19 columns. Accordingly, the range of parallax numbers within an elemental image varies from the center toward the right or left end of the screen. In contrast, with a typical multiview system display, the range of parallax number shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is maintained all over the screen.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In the description below, it is assumed that if minimum unit pixel groups each forming a square are counted, the two-dimensional image display apparatus has, for example, 1,920 pixels (corresponding to the LCD pixel numbers 1 to 1920) in the horizontal direction and 1,200 pixels in the vertical direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Further, each minimum unit pixel group is assumed to contain red, green, and blue sub-pixels (RGB). These sub-pixels correspond to the LCD sub-pixel numbers 1 to 5,760, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>

That is, a pixel boundary is assumed to be passed by a central axis <b>351</b> (perpendicular to the display surface) passing through the center between the adjacent optical apertures in the slit <b>333</b> or a reference axis <b>352</b> (perpendicular to the display surface) passing through the boundary between the adjacent cylindrical lenses. An integral number of pixels are arranged in the area between the central axes <b>351</b> or reference axes <b>352</b>. The horizontal pitch Ps (period) of the central axes <b>351</b> or reference axes <b>352</b> is set at a specified value.

As described above, with one-dimensional integral imaging, the pitch Ps of the parallax barrier (not the pitch Ps that is visible as a result of the difference in distance but the actual pitch Ps of the parallax barrier) is an integral multiple of the pixel pitch Pp. In contrast, with the multiview system, the elemental image pitch Pe is generally an integral multiple of the pixel pitch Pp.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a conceptual drawing of a method of rearranging images in the display surface of the display apparatus for the parallel-ray II system as viewed from front of the display module <b>331</b>. The display surface of the display module <b>331</b> is divided into pixel groups that display elemental images <b>370</b> (enclosed by a thick frame) corresponding to the respective apertures (the optical apertures of the parallax barrier). With the II system, each of the elemental images is displayed in a pixel group (its width is denoted by Pe) composed of 18 or 19 columns. The total number of columns to which parallax can be assigned is 5,670 because each LCD pixel consists of three LCD sub-pixels. The number of apertures is 320 (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the range of aperture numbers (lens or slit numbers) shown in the area denoted by reference numeral <b>364</b> is #&#x2212;160 to #&#x2212;1 and #1 to #160). The aperture pitch Ps is equal to the width of 18 columns. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, in each column <b>365</b>, the corresponding parallax number is shown, as an item, in the area shown by reference numeral <b>363</b> (in this example, one of the parallax numbers &#x2212;17 to &#x2212;1 and 1 to 17 for 34 directions as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). The elemental image with the aperture number #1 consists of 18 parallax components with the parallax numbers &#x2212;9 to &#x2212;1 and 1 to 9. The elemental image with the aperture number #&#x2212;159 consists of 18 parallax components with the parallax numbers &#x2212;17 to &#x2212;1 and 1. The width of each elemental image is slightly larger than the width of 18 columns. Accordingly, when the boundary between the adjacent elemental images is aligned with the nearest column boundary (normal A-D conversion method), the number of columns per aperture is 18 for most apertures, but 19 for some apertures. At each aperture number corresponding to 19 columns, the range of parallax numbers in the aperture is shifted by one. The aperture numbers corresponding to 19 columns are #10, #30, #49, #69, #88, #107, #127, and #146 (and the same numbers each with a minus sign) (viewing distance: 700 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows aperture numbers (slit (lens) numbers in the table) at which the arrangement of parallax component images in each direction starts and ends. The table also shows column numbers (3D pixel numbers) based on the horizontal resolution obtained when the corresponding three-dimensional image is displayed, and sub-pixel column numbers (LCD sub-pixel numbers) and pixel column numbers (LCD pixel numbers) on the parallax interleaved image display module. The three-dimensional image is displayed by assigning the parallax component images as described above. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the shaded parts indicate the minimum projection range (slit or lens number and 3D pixel number) of the parallax component image no. &#x2212;17 and the arrangement range (LCD pixel number and LCD sub-pixel number) of the parallax component image in the parallax interleaved image. The parallax component image in the left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> uses only the shaded part. However, common input data not specifically provided for the II system display apparatus may use the total range instead of only the shaded part. This does not pose any problem. The shaded part in this example corresponds to the range of 14 columns (15&#x2212;2+1 or (&#x2212;146)&#x2212;(&#x2212;159)+1) in terms of 3D pixel numbers or slit (lens) numbers. In the parallax interleaved image in the right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the above 14 columns are dividedly arranged every 18 columns within the shaded range. In this case, both the number of columns and the number of instances of parallax are 18. Since the 14 columns in the parallax component image are arranged in every 18 columns, the range of LCD sub-pixel numbers corresponds to 235 columns (245&#x2212;11+1 is equal to 18&#xd7;(14&#x2212;1)+1). The range of LCD pixel numbers corresponds to 79 columns (82&#x2212;4+1), which is about one-third of the range of LCD sub-pixel numbers (LCD sub-pixel numbers 11 and 245 belong to LCD pixel numbers 4 and 82). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shoes these column ranges, illustratively described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, for all the parallax numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Not only in the compressed and emphasized display mode but in the normal display mode and binocular and multiview compatible mode, the observation standard viewing distance, which determines the elemental image width, need not necessarily be the same as the distance used as a reference for perspective projection (the distance between the projection center line and the projection plane). No particular problem occurs provided that the distances have roughly close values (the ratio of the distances is about &#xbd; to 2).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As described above, for the parallel-ray II system, the three-dimensional display apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention can display perspective projection images for the binocular and multiview system or the like as well as three-dimensional images compressed on the front- and rear-sides and emphasized in the vertical and horizontal directions.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, a subject position detector <b>431</b> is installed in a central position of a row of cameras <b>429</b> arranged at equal intervals in the horizontal direction. All the cameras <b>429</b> are adjusted so that an image containing subjects <b>421</b><i>a </i>and <b>421</b><i>b </i>is captured by projecting it on a projection plane <b>422</b>. In this case, the focus is on <b>421</b><i>b</i>, located close to the projection plane. Values predetermined on the basis of the configuration of the display apparatus are input for the z coordinate zn of the front-side limit, the z coordinate zf of the rear-side limit, the observation standard viewing distance (normal camera distance) L, and the appropriate camera interval (normal camera interval) P. This allows the derivation of relational expressions on the ratio a of the camera interval to the appropriate camera interval, the depth compression scale factor b, the ratio q of the camera distance to the observation standard viewing distance, the z coordinate zn of the front-side limit, and the z coordinate zf of the rear-side limit.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, the detector <b>431</b> detects the distance to the position of a part of the subject <b>421</b><i>a</i>, which is closest to the camera <b>429</b>. The detector <b>431</b> also uses an auto focusing function or manual focusing function to detect the distance to the subject <b>421</b><i>b</i>, on which the camera is to be focused. Further, photographing plane (projection plane) size information (the ratio of the photographing plane size to the display surface size) is obtained on the basis of the angle of view detected using a zoom function. On the basis of these data, the compression ratio b is determined (steps S<b>30</b>, S<b>31</b>, and S<b>32</b>). The camera distance ratio q is also determined (steps S<b>30</b> and S<b>33</b>). Subsequently, the optimum camera <b>429</b> interval ratio a is determined from the relation expressions on the camera interval ratio a, the scale factor b, the camera distance ratio q, the z coordinate zn of the front-side limit, and the z coordinate zf of the rear-side limit (steps S<b>34</b> and S<b>35</b>). The optimum camera <b>429</b> interval ratio a is displayed or the photographer is warned that the camera <b>429</b> internal does not meet the condition (steps S<b>36</b> and S<b>37</b>). The camera may have a function for automatically adjusting the camera <b>429</b> interval to the optimum value. The camera <b>429</b> interval may be mechanically varied or equivalently varied using an optical system or circuit processing. Alternatively, it is possible to select one of a large number of cameras <b>429</b> closely installed on a straight line which corresponds to the optimum interval.

Further, photographing plane (projection plane) size information (the ratio of the photographing plane size to the display surface size) is obtained on the basis of the angle of view detected using the zoom function. On the basis of these data, the camera distance ratio q is also determined (steps S<b>40</b> and S<b>41</b>). Subsequently, on the basis of the camera <b>429</b> interval ratio a and compression ratio b that are, for example, manually preset (steps S<b>42</b> and S<b>43</b>), the apparatus determines whether the distance to the nearest subject <b>421</b><i>a </i>detected by the detector <b>431</b> (step S<b>44</b>) exceeds the front- or rear-side limit area zn or zf (step S<b>46</b>). If the distance exceeds the front- or rear-side limit area zn or zf, warning is given or the optimum camera <b>429</b> interval a is displayed (steps S<b>47</b> and S<b>48</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for remote accessing a multi-line residential telephone system. Using a first remote telephone, a calling party dials a telephone number associated with a first telephone line of the multi-line residential telephone system. After a predetermined number of unanswered rings at the first telephone line of the multi-line telephone system, the multi-line telephone system prompts the calling party to input a code. After a successful verification of the code, the multi-line telephone system connects the first remote telephone with a second telephone line of the multi-line telephone system so that the calling party receives a dial tone over the second telephone line. The calling party then dials a terminating telephone number associated with a second remote telephone to establish communication with a called party of the second remote telephone.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to telephone communications devices. In particular, the invention relates to remote line access for a multi-line residential telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A local telephone company typically provides services to a single line in subscriber's homes, leaving any extra lines unused. Individuals can request that service be provided to a second line so as to, for example, supply a separate phone line and distinct phone number in the home office or to provide different phone numbers for different members in the family. In recent years, the increased use of devices, such as fax machines and personal computer modem, that require telephone connectivity, has led to a further increase in the number of individuals requesting additional lines of telephone service. Accordingly, many homes are wired with two separate telephone lines. Some homes are even wired with as many as four separate telephone lines.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As multiple lines of telephone service are activated, multi-line telephone sets are then needed to access these multiple phone lines using a single telephone device. In a home application where there exist only two active lines, a dual-line telephone set is typically used by connecting the set to the two separate phone lines via two standard telephone cables. The user may then press buttons on the multi-line telephone set to select one line or the other line to make or receive a call. Many multi-line telephone sets also provide functionality to establish a conference connection state among two available lines and the user of the telephone set such that the user may establish a connection with both lines simultaneously. Thus by pressing buttons on the multi-line telephone set the user may switch between the two connections, either maintaining separate conversations or establishing a conference call whereby all three parties may converse together simultaneously across the two lines.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Multiple phone lines are even more commonplace in business environments where multiple lines are typically used to provide phone service to many locations within an organization. Depending on the size of the company, the number of lines could range from two to four lines in a single office location to hundreds or even thousands of lines that span multiple locations across a country or countries. Sophisticated private branch exchange (PBX) equipment is typically used to manage the routing of calls and other data within these large telephone communication systems. The PBX systems are often digital, complicated to configure and maintain, and expensive. Moreover, the PBX systems require central call routing hardware external to the telephone set. For these reasons, such systems are not well suited for residential applications.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition to enabling the making and receiving of multiple calls by multiple users of a commercial PBX system, such systems also often offer Direct Inward System Access (&#x201c;DISA&#x201d;). DISA is a service that allows users to dial into the PBX system from a telephone outside the system, and after entering an access code, to use the services of the PBX system remotely. Such a service offers many benefits to the user. Since some large companies operate their own private branch exchanges that span great distances, a user wishing to call a branch office across the country from a telephone not connected to the company's telephone system could dial into the system by making an inexpensive local call, and then access the DISA service to place the long-distance call to the branch office. Because DISA enables the user to place a call as if the user were physically calling from within the PBX system, the user incurs no long-distance telephone charges, and any long-distance charges that are incurred would be billed to the company number rather than the user.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While PBX systems are generally inappropriate for residential applications because of their complexity and cost, individuals would benefit from certain features provided by typical PBX systems. One such feature is DISA functionality. Residential users would benefit from being able to dial into one line and remotely access a second line to place calls that are billed to the user's residence rather than to the remote location. The user could then place long-distance calls from a remote location where such calls are either expensive or prohibited, and take advantage of the very low long-distance service rates typically provided to residential locations. Moreover, there exists a need to provide this service at significantly lower cost and lower technical complexity than is offered by PBX systems used today in business applications. As such, it is an object of this invention to provide a structure and means for remote line access for multi-line residential telephones that is inexpensive, easy to install and operate and allows users to utilize their home's multiple telephone lines from a remote location.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the present specifications, drawings and claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">While this invention is susceptible to embodiment in many different forms, there are shown in the drawings and will be described in detail herein specific embodiments. The present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principle of the invention intended merely to explain and illustrate the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention in any way to embodiments illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts one exemplary embodiment of a remote line access for a multi-line residential telephone in accordance with the present invention. Multi-line telephone set <b>100</b> comprises internal conference connection module <b>150</b> that is shown coupled to telephone lines <b>130</b> and <b>160</b>. According to the present invention, by use of internal conference connection module <b>150</b>, multi-line telephone set <b>100</b> allows calling party <b>110</b> to call a telephone number associated with first telephone line (for example, first line <b>130</b>) of telephone set <b>100</b> by using a remote telephone and to use second telephone line (for example, second line <b>160</b>) of telephone set <b>100</b> to make outgoing calls using the service plan of telephone set <b>100</b>. Preferably, the remote telephone can be another telephone set, a cellular telephone or a public telephone. Further, the call is connected to telephone set <b>100</b> through Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) central telephone office <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Telephone set <b>100</b> further includes an microprocessor <b>170</b> and Dual-Tone Multiple Frequency (DTMF) tone detector <b>140</b> coupled to internal conference connection module <b>150</b>. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of present invention, after a predetermined number of unanswered rings, microprocessor <b>170</b> answers the call by opening a connection on line <b>130</b> and automatically couples line <b>130</b> to internal DTMF tone detector <b>140</b> via a DTMF Conference Connection (not shown). Microprocessor <b>170</b> then plays to calling party <b>110</b> over line <b>130</b> a recorded welcome message that prompts the calling party to enter a predetermined personal identification number (PIN) via dialing DTMF tones to gain remote access to the telephone set <b>100</b> system. Instead of playing the recorded welcome message, in another embodiment, microprocessor <b>170</b> generates a short noticeable sound, such as a beep sound, that prompts calling party <b>110</b> to enter the PIN.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Calling party <b>110</b> enters the requisite PIN using the remote telephone set touch-tone keypad. The resulting DTMF signals are received and decoded by DTMF Tone Detector <b>140</b>, after which caller <b>110</b> may be required to enter a further predetermined DTMF code to enable internal conference connection module <b>150</b>. In another preferred embodiment, calling party <b>110</b> can also enter the requisite PIN using a speakerphone of the remote telephone set to generate audio signals. In this case, voice recognition module <b>190</b> of telephone set system <b>100</b> receives and decodes audio signals from calling party <b>110</b> to enable internal conference connection module <b>150</b>. At the time, calling party <b>120</b> connects to second line <b>160</b> through first line <b>130</b> by means of Internal Conference Connection module <b>150</b>. Internal Conference Connection module <b>150</b> acts as a switch to establish a conference connection state between lines <b>130</b> and <b>160</b>. A software program and microprocessor <b>170</b> controls telephone set <b>100</b> operations including Internal Conference Connection module <b>150</b> operation and microprocessor <b>170</b> accepts command inputs from DTMF tone detector <b>140</b> as well as from front-panel buttons or switches of telephone set <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">There are two ways in the present invention to enable calling party <b>110</b> to complete a call to third party <b>180</b>. In one embodiment, upon the successful completion of this sequence, calling party <b>110</b> is connected via first line <b>130</b> to second line <b>160</b> and receives a dial tone on second line <b>160</b> from PSTN <b>120</b>. Calling party <b>100</b> may then commence DTMF dialing into the PSTN to connect to third party <b>180</b> via an internal conference connection. In an another embodiment, telephone system <b>100</b> may include a DTMF generator <b>195</b>. When calling party <b>110</b> dials a telephone number corresponding to third party <b>180</b> through second line <b>160</b>, DTMF tone detector <b>140</b> receives and decodes the telephone number. Microprocessor <b>170</b> then enables DTMF generator <b>195</b> to dial the telephone number and connects second line <b>160</b> with third party <b>180</b>. At the time, calling party <b>160</b> is communicating with third party <b>180</b> using a service plan of line <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An exemplary method of remote line access for a multi-line residential telephone in accordance with the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At step <b>21</b>, telephone set <b>100</b> receives an incoming call associated with first line <b>130</b> from user <b>110</b> through a first remote telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At step <b>22</b>, if the incoming call has been answered, microprocessor <b>170</b> connects first line <b>130</b> with first remote telephone <b>110</b> through PSTN. The remote line access process ends, as shown at step <b>30</b>. If, however, the incoming call has not been answered after a predetermined number of rings, microprocessor <b>170</b> answers the call by activating DTMF tone detector <b>140</b>, as shown at step <b>23</b>. At step <b>24</b>, microprocessor further couples first line <b>130</b> with DTMF tone detector <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">At step <b>25</b>, microprocessor <b>170</b> plays a pre-recorded message or just generates a beep sound to user <b>110</b> prompting user <b>110</b> to enter his/her password.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At step <b>26</b>, user <b>110</b> enters his/her password, which in turn is encoded in a form of DTMF signals. The DTMF signals are received and decoded by DTMF tone detector <b>140</b> for the purpose of authorization. If user <b>110</b> is not an authorized user, the process ends, as shown at step <b>30</b>. If user <b>110</b> is an authorized user, microprocessor plays a further message comprising a number of choices so that user <b>110</b> selects one selection. As described above, the microprocessor can just generate a short noticeable sound, such as a beep sound, to prompt the user to make the selection.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At step <b>27</b>, user <b>110</b> enters a selection. In the preferred embodiment, user <b>110</b> selects entering an internal conference connection function and optionally, a predetermined authorization code to initiate internal conference connection <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">After internal conference connection module <b>150</b> is activated, at step <b>28</b>, calling party <b>110</b> is connected to second line <b>160</b> through line <b>130</b>. At the time, calling party <b>110</b> receives dialing tones from second line <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At step <b>29</b>, user <b>110</b> then dials a telephone number associated with a second remote telephone that he/she wishes to connect by using the dialing tone of second line <b>160</b> through PSTN <b>120</b> and the service plan of second line <b>160</b>. As described above, by doing so, user <b>110</b> can take the advantage of making a cheaper telephone call by using the service plan of line <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an alternative embodiment, at step <b>29</b>, when user <b>110</b> dials the telephone number associated with a second remote telephone (such as third party <b>180</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>), DTMF tone detector <b>140</b> receives and decodes the telephone number. Next, microprocessor <b>170</b> enables DTMF generator <b>195</b> to dial the telephone number and connect second line <b>160</b> with the second remote telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, at any time while the conference connection is established between first and second lines <b>130</b> and <b>160</b>, calling party <b>110</b> may enter yet a further predetermined DTMF sequence that will act to terminate the telephone connection on second line <b>160</b> and re-establish a dial tone from PSTN <b>120</b>. In this manner the user may make a number of calls via second line <b>160</b> without the need to break the connection with first line <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When having finished making remote calls via telephone set <b>100</b>, calling party <b>110</b> may disconnect from <b>100</b> by either entering yet another further predetermined DTMF sequence that instructs <b>100</b> to disconnect itself from the first line <b>130</b> or by terminating the call directly at the remote telephone set.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Multi-line telephone set <b>100</b> is shown with two lines, <b>130</b> and <b>160</b>, however may in practice be a multi-line unit with more than two lines as well as be used in residential, commercial or other environments without departing from the invention. Furthermore, is understood that any available line in telephone set <b>100</b> may be dialed directly and a subsequent connection be made to any other available line or lines in telephone set <b>100</b> through the method and embodiment described herein without departing from the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The foregoing disclosure of the preferred embodiments of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Many variations and modifications of the embodiments described herein will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the above disclosure.

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods and systems for proximity based communication between users of proximity communication devices (&#x201c;PCDs&#x201d;). A localized communication network is established by peer-to-peer communication between PCDs. Each PCD communicates with other PCDs in a wireless, localized, peer-to-peer network structure. Each PCD is identified to other PCDs in its own localized area by its geographical position and/or other attributes. A user may therefore establish communications with another user based upon the other user's proximity to the first user's PCD or other attributes rather than by a fixed ID code such as a phone number or address. The PCDs may share multiple synchronization channels derived from multiple timing sources and may select among the synchronization channels when establishing a connection. The PCDs may provide a user interface to permit filtering of display of PCDs in the proximity of communication and may also provide multi-player video gaming through the proximity communication features hereof.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates generally to communication systems and more specifically relates to methods and systems for communicating among communication devices identified by physical location and/or relative proximity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Statement of the Problem</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous types of communication systems are known, commercially available and particularly suited to one or another particular application. For example, standard &#x201c;landline&#x201d; telephony networks permit a user to establish communications through a vast switched network to virtually any other point on the globe having similar landline communication systems. Or, for example, cellular telephony utilizes frequency transceivers and related protocols to couple an end user's cellular telephone to a nearby cellular tower. Cellular tower base stations forward digitized voice data, analog voice data or other digital data to other towers as a cell phone moves out of range and also forwards user data for coupling to standard landline based switched telephony systems. Thus cellular telephone users may connect with any landline telephone equipment or other cellular telephone users (coupled, in turn, to landline switched telephone networks through respective cell tower base stations).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, all such telephony communication systems are limited in two important respects. First, end user devices may communicate with one another only via a centralized server or network system (e.g., via respective cellular base stations and/or switched telephony networks). Landline telephony systems provide a network of switching devices to establish circuits between two or more end user telephone devices (or other data or voice communication devices). Cellular base stations atop cellular towers are required for cellular telephone users to establish connections with land based telephony systems or other cellular telephone users. If these centralized servers or networks are for any reason unavailable, no communication may be established between end users of the communication devices.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Secondly, to establish a call connection between two end user devices, a telephone number or other indicia (e.g., network address, ID, etc.) must be supplied to identify the other device with which communications are to be established. These indicia are static regardless of where the user is located and is required information to establish a call connection.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Radio frequency based communication systems such as citizens band (&#x201c;CB&#x201d;) radios or simple &#x201c;walkie talkie&#x201d; radio devices do not require a centralized server or communication node but rather communicate directly from one end user's radio device to other user radio devices. However, radio communication systems do not generally provided for establishing a specific point-to-point call between one end user radio device and one or more particular, identified other end user radio devices. Rather, radio communication systems generally operate in a broadcast mode such that all users whose transceiver is tuned to a particular frequency or channel receive every transmission on that frequency or &#x201c;channel&#x201d;. No private communication links may be established under such typical radio based communication systems. Although transmissions may be encrypted or scrambled, any radio device equipped with the proper decryption code and within transmission range can receive and decrypt the transmissions. No specific user or device may be identified in typical radio frequency based communication systems. Further, radio based communication systems generally do not provide for any protocol to establish the beginning of a call connection and the termination of an established connection. Radio communications are merely established by beginning transmission of a broadcast signal and ended when a user chooses to cease termination. Another weakness of radio based communication systems arises in that user data (voice or other data) is not encoded for spread spectrum high speed communications.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a number of communication applications, it may be desirable or required to ensure continued communication capabilities without having to rely on a centralized server/network or communication tower. In an emergency scene response communication application or in a military combat communication application, it is important that the communication systems operate despite loss or failure of a central server/network or cell tower base stations. A communication system based on a centralized server/network or a cellular base station tower may be easily disabled by eliminating the central server or tower.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, it may be beneficial in many communication applications to permit establishment of a call connection (initiation of a call) to a specific device identified based on its geographical location (i.e., its physical proximity to the initiator of the call). Still further, in addition to location attributes to identify another communication device, it may be useful to identify a desired device for communication based upon other attributes of the user or the communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, in a military context, it may be useful for military personnel in combat to be able to communicate with another soldier or other personnel based upon physical proximity to the initiator of the call. In other words, call &#x201c;the closest reinforcements&#x201d;. There may be no simple way to identify a phone number or other identifying address for the &#x201c;nearest&#x201d; personal. Or, for example, it may be beneficial to initiate a call to the nearest personnel having particular attribute capabilities. In other words, call the nearest &#x201c;EMT&#x201d; personnel or call the nearest soldiers &#x201c;with heavy artillery&#x201d; or call the nearest &#x201c;medic&#x201d;, etc. Presently known communication systems do not provide simple techniques for identifying such personnel or attributes of another communication device and do not provide mechanisms to directly set up communications with such identified devices.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Similarly, in another exemplary application of communication systems, first responders in a rescue or emergency operation such as fire fighters, emergency medical technicians, police, etc., may desire communication systems that locate the nearest personnel for assistance or the nearest personnel with particular capabilities. Similar to military applications as noted above, rescue or emergency operations in the context of a disaster such as earthquakes or the collapse of a building may be significantly hindered if a central server or communication tower is disabled by the disaster they seek to address.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is evident from the above discussion that a need exists for an improved communication architecture providing mobility, reliability and location oriented identification of communication devices and users.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE SOLUTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention solves the above problems and other problems with improved methods and systems for proximity based communications. Proximity based communication systems and methods in accordance with features and aspects hereof may utilize radio frequency or other wireless transmission media and techniques to permit peer-to-peer communication between suitable proximity communication devices. Features and aspects hereof do not depend upon a centralized server/network or cellular base station towers that may be disabled. Further, features and aspects hereof do not require a user to identify the recipient of an initiated call by a phone number or any other static, pre-defined address indicia. Rather, the peer-to-peer proximity communication devices and methods hereof permit establishment of a call connection based principally upon geographical location (i.e., based upon proximity to the proximity communication device (&#x201c;PCD&#x201d;) of the call initiator). Other features and aspects hereof permit location information for each PCD to be associated with other attribute data such that the recipient of an initiated phone call may be identified by proximity to the call initiator in combination with other attribute information. Still other features and aspects hereof combine proximity communication features within a PCD with standard cellular or other wireless communication protocols to permit both proximity communication capabilities and other prior radio or telephony communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The PCD may be used strictly for voice communication, strictly for data communication, or for both voice and data communication. PCD features and aspects hereof may be applied for a variety of peer-to-peer communication applications including, for example, emergency site communications, secure site communications (such as emergency responders and military applications), ad hoc gaming connectivity with other PCDs used for game playing, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Display features and aspects hereof provide the user with a display indicating location and distance of other PCDs in the system relative to the user's PCD. Display options may allow the user to &#x201c;zoom&#x201d; in or out to view a closer proximity range or a wider proximity range. Other display options allow a user to define filters defining desired features or attributes for any PCDs to be displayed (e.g., display only &#x201c;Police&#x201d; PCDs or display all &#x201c;Supervisor&#x201d; PCDs, etc.). Still further, other display features allow a user to select a particular PCD and request a display of other attributes of the selected PCD or its distance from the user's PCD, etc. Thus the PCD display may be presented as a sequence of levels or layers that permit the user to navigate among a plurality of different information displays.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One feature hereof provides a proximity communication device (&#x201c;PCD&#x201d;). The PCD includes a locator to determine the geographic location of the PCD. The PCD also includes a wireless transceiver for exchanging information between the PCD and other PCDs. The information exchanged includes location of all PCDs and includes user data. The PCD is adapted to establish a peer-to-peer connection with another identified PCD based on the location of the other identified PCD and the PCD is adapted to communicate with other PCDs by synchronizing exchanges using one or more synchronization channels transmitted through the wireless transceiver such that synchronization signals derived from one or more timing sources are transmitted on the one or more synchronization channels.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another feature hereof provides a system that includes a plurality of proximity communication devices (&#x201c;PCDs&#x201d;). Each PCD further includes a locator to determine the geographic location of the PCD. Each PCD also includes a wireless transceiver for exchanging information between the PCD and other PCDs. The information exchanged includes location of all PCDs and user data. Each PCD of the plurality of PCDs is adapted to establish a peer-to-peer connection with another identified PCD of the plurality of PCDs based on the location of the other identified PCD.

The method then establishes at least one call connection between the first PCD and tie second PCD based upon location information exchanged between the first PCD and the second PCD. The call connection is synchronized utilizing the selected synchronization channel.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For the purpose of teaching inventive principles in the following discussion, some conventional aspects of the invention have been simplified or omitted. Those skilled in the art will appreciate variations from these embodiments that fall within the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the features and aspects described below can be combined in various ways to form multiple variations of the invention. As a result, the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described below, but only by the claims that follow and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a proximity communication system <b>100</b> providing features and aspects hereof. System <b>100</b> may comprise any number of proximity communication devices. PCDs <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> each represent proximity communication devices providing telephonic features for a user. Telephonic features as used herein refers to communication of voice and non-voice data between two appropriately configured telephonic PCDs. PCD <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are configured to provide such telephonic features within the context of proximity communication system <b>100</b>. By contrast, PCD <b>104</b> provides telephonic functionality within the context of proximity communication system <b>100</b> and also provides features to permit telephonic communication through well-known cellular telephony systems. PCD <b>104</b> therefore provides dual functionality to permit communication both in the context of proximity communication system <b>100</b> and standard cellular telephony through cellular base station tower <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In like manner, proximity communication system <b>100</b> may include PCD devices offering data processing and computing functionality. PCD <b>102</b> and <b>110</b> represent computing devices adapted for communication within proximity communication system <b>100</b>. PCD <b>110</b> is adapted exclusively for communication within proximity communication system <b>100</b> while PCD <b>102</b> represents a dual capable computing device operable to communicate in a proximity communication system <b>100</b> as well as in a cellular communication structure such as cellular base station tower <b>120</b>. PCD devices <b>102</b> and <b>110</b> are exemplary of devices that generally exchange non-voice user data. Laptop/notebook computers and PDAs are examples of such devices that primarily exchange non-voice related user data. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the numerous equivalent devices capable of providing only voice data exchange, only non-voice data exchange or both voice and non-voice data exchange. For example, modern cellular telephonic devices are capable of exchanging both voice data and non-voice data with other similarly equipped devices. In like manner, PDAs or computers may exchange both non-voice data and voice data. The distinction between such devices has faded in importance and is at times irrelevant. Thus, those of ordinary skill and the art will recognize that any number and any variety of PCD capable devices may be utilized within exemplary proximity communication system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Proximity communication system <b>100</b> permits identification of each PCD principally by its present location as distinct from a fixed telephone number or other fixed address indicia. As discussed further herein below, each PCD in proximity communication system <b>100</b> is capable of operating in a peer-to-peer mode to communicate with any other PCD in system <b>100</b>. No centralized server or cellular base station is required for operation of proximity communication system <b>100</b>. Rather, each PCD is made aware of all other PCDs in proximity communication system <b>100</b> and may establish private communication channels with one or more other PCDs in system <b>100</b>. Each PCD is identified principally by its present location relative to each other PCD. As discussed further herein below, each PCD includes a locator component to determine its position. The position may be determined as an absolute geographic locations and/or a location relative to other PCDs in the system <b>100</b>. For example, each PCD may include a global positioning system (&#x201c;GPS&#x201d;) receiver or other absolute location determination means to establish an absolute location which may then be converted to relative location information to locate a PCD relative to other PCDs and/or to determine a location relative to other PCDs having a known absolute location&#x2014;thus the relative location may be used to determine an absolute location.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Since each PCD establishes a peer-to-peer connection with one or more other PCD, there is no central server/network required to establish communication. Proximity communication locale <b>112</b> is not a central server or network but rather simply represents any geographical area defined by the transmission and reception range limitations of the particular wireless transceiver technologies utilized within PCDs <b>102</b> through <b>110</b> of system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">All PCDs <b>102</b> through <b>110</b> within system <b>100</b> exchange information during initialization and periodically thereafter to indicate their present physical position. The present physical position of a PCD may be determined by the PCD, for example, by global positioning system (&#x201c;GPS&#x201d;) technology embedded within each PCD or by other locator means within each PCD. During initialization, each PCD determines its absolute location and communicates it (broadcasts it) to all other PCDs within the range of proximity communication locale <b>112</b>. Each PCD therefore also receives broadcast location information from each other PCD so that it may determine the relative position for each of the other PCDs in the system <b>100</b>. Such relative position information may therefore be used by a user to select one or more other PCD's with which a communication channel is to be established (i.e., with which a call connection is to be established).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As noted, each PCD may also include other locator means in addition to, or in the alternative to, GPS locator features. A PCD may include means for automatically determining a relative location&#x2014;relative to another PCD whose absolute location is known (e.g., by use of GPS in the other PCD). For example, each PCD may include features for transmission and reception of a fixed strength, beacon signal. Any PCD may then determine its location relative to other PCDs by well known triangulation capabilities based on received signal strength (&#x201c;RSS &#x201d;) of the beacon signal from at least two PCDs. Such a relative location may then be converted to an absolute location by other means. For example, triangulating from one or more other PCDs that have GPS locator means allows a PCD without GPS to determine its absolute location by triangulating a relative position from the other PCDs whose absolute location is know. In addition to triangulation techniques using RSS, relative locator means may include well known time of arrival (&#x201c;TOA&#x201d;) and differential time of arrival (&#x201c;DTOA&#x201d;) techniques for determining relative location from another PCD having a known, absolute location. A wide variety of equivalent relative locator means structures and techniques are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such relative location means may include any means that accesses information regarding relative distance of the PCD from a known absolute location such as another PCD or from that of a fixed landmark.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition, locator means may include manual entry locator means for user entry of an absolute location. A user may enter an absolute location such as a street address or other landmark designation that may be converted by commercially available databases into absolute coordinate locations. The manual entry locator means may also be adapted to permit direct entry by a user of an absolute coordinate position, e.g., manual entry by a user of known longitude/latitude/altitude absolute location information such as from a separate GPS unit not integrated with the PCD or other such indicators.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In accordance with features and aspects hereof, each PCD is mobile and may freely move about anywhere within the range of proximity communication locale <b>112</b>. Further, a particular PCD may be identified by a user from another PCD based on location information only rather than requiring apriori knowledge of a telephone number or other address indicia. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also recognize that other identification information, in addition to present location, may be exchanged between the PCDs of system <b>100</b>. Therefore, in accordance with features and aspects hereof, a user may also select one or more other PCDs with which to establish a call connection based on present location of the other PCDs and other attributes identified and associated with each PCD. For example, such other attributes may include capabilities associated with the location or available at the location of the PCD, name or other indicia associated with a user of another PCD, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">By contrast to proximity communication system <b>100</b>, standard telephonic communication systems such as PSTN switch <b>140</b> and associated landline telephones <b>150</b> are restricted in their mobility and require identification of each telephone by a particular telephone number regardless of its present location. Cellular telephony systems represented as cell phone <b>130</b> coupled by wireless communication to cellular base station tower <b>120</b> provide mobility as compared to land line telephone systems but none the less require identification of a particular cell phone by its telephone number regardless of its present physical location. Landline telephony systems and cellular telephony systems also both require a centralized server or cell tower base station to permit communication between two landline telephones or between a cell phone and any other telephone device. Failure of the server/network or the cellular base station may render all associated telephone equipment unusable.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Proximity communication system <b>100</b> may utilize any of several well known, commercially available, wireless communication protocols and standards. For example, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (&#x201c;3GPP&#x201d;&#x2014;well known information available at www.3gpp.org) defines wireless transmission standards and associated protocols for establishing connections and associated channels and also defines a framework for the interconnection of the various protocols. For example, in accordance with 3GPP standards, PCDs may use spread spectrum encoding techniques to multiplex a number of logical channels of data on a common carrier frequency band. Code division multiple access (&#x201c;CDMA&#x201d;) encoding techniques are one form of spread spectrum encoding and may be applied in PCDs to permit multiplexing of a variety of logical channels over a single, low power radio frequency carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As will be discussed further herein below, such spread spectrum communication techniques permit a large number of logical channels to be defined within a single frequency band for radio frequency (&#x201c;RF&#x201d;) transmissions. CDMA spread spectrum techniques generally define each channel by a digital code value used to encode (to spread) the data for a corresponding channel within a transmitted bitstream. The superposition of a plurality of such CDMA spread spectrum signal channels helps reduce the potential for intentional interference or eavesdropping because the superposition of multiple such channel signals results in a low power signal appearing virtually indistinguishable from background noise in the transmission medium. Only by knowing the specific code word for a particular logical channel can a receiver effectively isolate the intended channel data from the other superposed signals making up background noise relative to the desired channel. Such spread spectrum techniques and standards defined by 3GPP standards are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and readily available for commercial use.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">One particular feature of 3GPP standards useful in the proximity communication system features and aspects hereof derives from the definition of two forms or phases of encoding. A first form or phase of encoding is the channelization or channel separation encoding to effectuate the spread spectrum modulation of multiple logical channels multiplexed in a single frequency band. A second form or phase of encoding is referred to as scrambling or source separation in the context of 3GPP. Scrambling codes or source separation codes are used to define dedicated channels between a particular pair of PCDs that have an established call connection. The scrambling code defines such dedicated channels and, in conjunction with other secure communication techniques helps to further reduce potential for inadvertent or intentional eavesdropping or capture of transmitted data.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Still another aspect of 3GPP wireless standards useful in the context of a proximity communication system derives from the use of time division duplex or frequency division duplex to further multiplex information transmitted over a logical spread spectrum channel. Time division duplex (&#x201c;TDD&#x201d;) or frequency division duplex (&#x201c;FDD&#x201d;) paradigms may be useful in the context of PCD communication for segmenting full duplex uplink and downlink transmissions. These multiplexing techniques define &#x201c;frame&#x201d; boundaries and &#x201c;slot&#x201d; boundaries for segments of information to be exchanged. The communicating devices synchronize their respective exchanges to these defined frame and slot boundaries.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize a wide variety of equivalent modulation and multiplexing techniques for providing wireless communications useful in the context of proximity communication features and aspects hereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram describing an exemplary embodiment of a PCD. As generally noted above, a PCD may be any device that provides voice data exchange and/or non-voice data exchange utilizing peer-to-peer communication protocols in accordance with features and aspects hereof. An exemplary PCD (<b>102</b>-<b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) includes a locator element <b>200</b>. Locator <b>200</b> is operable to determine the present absolute location of the PCD relative to the globe or relative to any other fixed point of reference defined by the specific locator technology. As noted above GPS or other well known locator structures and techniques may be employed by locator <b>200</b> to provide such location information. Devices and methods associated with such a GPS locator or other locating technologies are readily available and well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, as noted above, locator <b>200</b> may also represent suitable processing to permit manual entry of an absolute location of the PCD. Still further, the absolute location may be determined by locator <b>200</b> as a relative offset from one or more other PCDs whose absolute location is known. For example, locator <b>200</b> in a first PCD may be devoid of GPS features (or simply not presently receiving a GPS signal) but may determine its relative position with respect to other PCDs that have a known absolute location (e.g., from an operational GPS receiver therein). Such a determination may employ manual location entry means, triangulation means, TOA/DTOA means, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An exemplary PCD also includes a wireless transceiver element <b>202</b> capable of transmitting and receiving data in accordance with the protocols and standards adopted for a particular proximity communication system. PCD protocols and standards may utilize any appropriate wireless communication modulation and protocol standards. Although a simple embodiment of such a dual function PCD may separate the cellular telephony communications in a different frequency band than that used for proximity communications, it may also be feasible to integrate the two communication systems in a common frequency band with separation based upon logical channel definitions.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Wireless transceiver <b>202</b> may also include synchronizer logic <b>222</b> for management and utilization of one or more synchronization channels used in the exchange of information between PCDs. As discussed further herein below, PCDs in accordance with features and aspects hereof may utilize one or more synchronization channels that carry synchronization information derived from one or more timing sources. Further, as discussed in additional detail herein below, one or more of the PCDs may generate and transmit such synchronization information. The synchronization information may be, for example, an un-encoded static bit pattern transmitted at predetermined time intervals. Thus any PCD that receives the synchronization information on such a synchronization channel may synchronize its use of frames and slots to transmit application related information (e.g., voice or other data) when transceiving over other defined channels between PCDs. Synchronizer logic <b>222</b> therefore represents processing to generate and transmit synchronization information from one or more PCDs over one or more predefined channels and derived from one or more timing sources.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An exemplary PCD may optionally include a cellular telephony or computer network wireless transceiver element <b>204</b> to permit dual functionality of the PCD both for use in the context of a proximity communication system and for use in other wireless communication applications such as wireless computing networks and cellular telephony. Such a dual purpose PCD may therefore allow communications both within a proximity communication system and in conjunction with other prior communication structures.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">User interface <b>220</b> provides for presenting information to a user and for receiving user input. For example, an LCD or other display device may be included within user interface <b>220</b> for presenting information regarding its PCD and other PCDs within the proximity communication system. User interface <b>220</b> may include touch screens, pointer devices, voice input functions, and other well-known user interface functions and elements may also provide structure and functionality to receive the user input. For example, in a proximity communication system in accordance with features and aspects hereof, each PCD is identified to a user of another PCD by, at least, its relative location to the user's PCD. Such location information may be presented to a user, for example, by an icon or other graphical representation of each other PCD located on an LCD screen in a manner indicative of the devices relative location with respect to the users PCD. Further, a user may select one or more such other PCDs with which to establish a call connection through use of user input devices such as a touch screen, pointer or other well-known user input functions and devices.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Control processor/memory <b>204</b> provides overall control of the PCD through a number of functional elements including, for example, user interaction element <b>208</b>, proximity determinator <b>210</b>, voice data processor <b>212</b>, and non-voice data processor <b>214</b>. Numerous other control functions will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. The representative functions are therefore intended merely as exemplary of significant aspects in operation of a PCD.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Control processor/memory <b>204</b> may be any suitable general or special purpose processor and associated program and data memory for storing and executing instructions to provide the depicted, exemplary functions (<b>208</b>-<b>214</b>) and other functions and features useful for wireless communication management. User interaction element <b>208</b> represents programmed instructions or other processing elements to interact with user interface element <b>220</b> providing output information to a user and receiving user input. Proximity determinator element <b>210</b> represents programmed instructions or other processing elements to interact with locator <b>200</b> to determine the PCD's present location and to interact with information received through wireless transceiver <b>202</b> representing location information of other PCDs in the system. Proximity determinator <b>210</b> therefore may determine the relative position of each other PCD relative to each user's PCD. Voice data processor <b>212</b> represents programmed instructions or other processing elements to transmit and receive human voice digitized information. The most common application of PCDs in a proximity communication system is to exchange voice information such as is common in telephony systems. Non-voice data processor element <b>214</b> represents programmed instructions or other processing elements to transmit and receive non-voice related digital data. PCDs including PDA or general purpose computing functionality may frequently exchange non-voice data while PCD elements providing primarily telephonic features may principally exchange voice data in their operation. However, as noted above, each device may be capable of exchanging both voice and non-voice data.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize numerous equivalent architectures within the scope of the attached claims for components within a PCD. Those not adapted to provide the features and aspects of the present invention, various functional elements of a PCD are generally commercially available and well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, locator <b>200</b>, wireless transceiver <b>202</b>, telephony transceiver <b>204</b>, user interface <b>220</b> and processor <b>204</b> are well known commercially available components. Further, it will be recognized that numerous other functional elements may be present in an equivalent architecture to provide the above and other features and aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart describing the overall operation of an exemplary proximity communication system. Element <b>300</b> represents processing within each PCD of the proximity communication system to initialize the PCD. In general, initialization of each PCD involves determining its location using GPS features or other locator components and techniques, generating a unique ID for each PCD to be used in protocol exchanges, generating spread spectrum channelization and scrambling codes for each PCD, establishing synchronization for exchanges between the PCDs, etc. Element <b>302</b> begins listening and broadcasting to exchange initial information among the PCDs initially within the proximity communication system. Such broadcast information may be applied to a channel associated with a predefined channel code known to all PCDs in the systems. In non-secure applications, this broadcast channel is predefined and known to all PCDs that may wish to participate in the proximity communication system. In secure applications (e.g., police, fire, military, etc.) this broadcast channel used to exchange initial information among the PCDs may be scrambled with further spread spectrum encoding techniques. An application specific scrambling code (&#x201c;ASSC&#x201d;) known only to appropriately authorized PCDs may be used to scramble the broadcast information. Thus unauthorized users/PCDs will not be able to receive the broadcast information and thus will be practically unable to determine locations and even existence of other PCDs in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Element <b>302</b> is also operable to resolve conflicts between PCDs that coincidentally selected an identical unique ID code. This ID, once conflicts are resolved, is used for the duration of the PCDs current operation (e.g., until reset or power is cycled). The ID is used by other PCDs in the system to correlate movement of this device and its icon for their respective displays. The ID is also used to associate scrambling codes with a particular PCD in establishing a call connection with another PCD and in exchanging information therebetween. Resolution of such conflicts may be performed in accordance with any of several well-known techniques. For example, each PCD that detects a conflict may randomly select a new ID that does not conflict with any other IDs in the received broadcast information. As each PCD listens for information being broadcast from the other PCDs it builds a table with of information regarding each PCD in the proximity communication system. Further details of initialization of each PCD are provided herein below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">New PCDs may periodically join the proximity communication system or may drop out of the proximity communication system as new users arrive and depart the locale in which the proximity communication system is operating. Element <b>304</b> therefore represents processing to periodically update the PCD information for each PCD in the proximity communication system. The periodically updated information to be broadcast may include, for example, an updated current location for each PCD, the unique ID for each PCD, spreading and scrambling code values, etc. The updated information may be periodically broadcast over a control channel such that every PCD may receive the information by listening to the same control channel. As noted above, this broadcast information may be scrambled using a pre-determined ASSC so that only an authorized subset of PCDs at a locale may descramble the information using the ASSC.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition to periodically updating information exchanged between the various PCDs, in element <b>304</b> each PCD performs processing to maintain synchronization with the control channel used for broadcasting information as well as for initially establishing desired call connections. As discussed below, numerous approaches may be employed to establish and maintain synchronization among the plurality of PCDs.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Element <b>306</b> then proceeds with normal operation of the system for exchange of user data among two or more PCDs these using the peer-to-peer channels defined in accordance with features and aspects hereof. As noted above, initialization of the system entails establishing one or more synchronization channels for broadcast of synchronization information generated by one or more PCDs derived from one or more timing sources. Since PCDs may enter and leave the proximity system over time, it is useful for each PCD to monitor the synchronization channel(s) to assure the continuous availability of required synchronization information. Element <b>308</b> is therefore operable to periodically monitor and manage the synchronization channels to assure continued availability of the requisite information. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the desired monitoring may also be implemented as an interrupt or event driven process so that changes in the system related to generation and utilization of synchronization information may cause an interrupt or event to trigger processing of element <b>308</b>. After some period of time exchanging user data or in response to receipt of new broadcast information from another PCD, processing continues looping back to element <b>304</b> to periodically update the PCD information exchanged between the various PCDs of the proximity communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart describing additional details of initialization of an individual PCD in the context of a proximity communication system. Element <b>400</b> is first operable to generate a unique PCD temporary ID (&#x201c;PTI&#x201d;). The PTI may be useful in protocols used for exchanging information between multiple PCDs. In particular, the PTI may be useful as an index to locate other information regarding a particular PCD from a table of entries regarding the system of PCDs. Element <b>402</b> then generates one or more In-Link scrambling codes&#x2014;a scrambling code as used herein may also be understood to be a spreading code as the term is defined in 3GPP standards. A first set of codes may be defined for &#x201c;channelization&#x201d;&#x2014;spreading codes are generally defined to &#x201c;spread&#x201d; data over a transmission signal. Channelization codes in accordance with 3GPP standards define a standard set of channels used by all communication devices in a system. Further spreading codes may define further channel or subchannel definitions. In essence, &#x201c;scrambling codes&#x201d; as the term is used herein are simply additional spreading codes used for different purposes. In the context of proximity communication systems in accordance with features and aspects hereof, the scrambling codes define specific channels to be used in an exchange between a corresponding pair of peer-to-peer communicating PCDs. Further source separation is achieved by second phase scrambling that separates the communication between pairs of communicating PCDs. Element <b>402</b> is therefore responsible for generating first phase scrambling codes for this PCD for communication over dedicated channels with this PCD. Alternatively, as noted herein below, source separation codes for a particular communicating pair of PCDs may be generated by processing associated with establishing the desired call connection.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Element <b>404</b> next interacts with the locator element within the PCD to obtain location information regarding the initial location of the PCD. As noted above, the locator may be a GPS receiver or other well known techniques to determine a location. As is generally known in the art, GPS receivers receive information that identifies an absolute geographic location on the planet for the receiving device. Other techniques such as triangulation of beacon signals (RSS), TOA, and DTOA may be employed to determine a relative location&#x2014;relative to other PCDs in the system at least one of which has a known absolute location. Thus the relative position of a PCD may be used to derive its absolute location. Alternatively, the initial location may be determined as any other location coordinates including relative locations relative to some nearby fixed reference point. The initial location may therefore also be a relative location relative to some reference point. Such a relative location may be established by element <b>402</b> by any of a variety of electronic means as above or may be established by manual input from an operator of the PCD indicating the absolute or relative location of the PCD.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In order for all PCDs to exchange initial information in preparation for normal operation, all PCDs may be synchronized to utilize a common control channel available to each PCD (e.g., encoded with a spreading code known to all PCDs). At initialization, each PCD may synchronize its bitstream for that predefined control channel. Well known frame and slot level synchronization techniques as defined in the 3GPP standards may be applied to the PCD synchronization processing of step <b>406</b>. In general, one or more synchronization channels (&#x201c;SCH&#x201d;) may be defined hi the carrier transmission, each synchronization channel providing synchronization information such as an un-encoded predetermined bit sequence. This un-encoded bit stream is repeated at fixed, predetermined intervals such that each PCD may synchronize frame and slot boundaries thereto. Such synchronization techniques as defined in the 3GPP standards are common and well known in the context of cellular telephony. However, unlike cellular telephony, proximity communication systems in accordance with features and aspects hereof do not rely on a central server or cellular base station to provide the synchronization channel stream. Rather, in accordance with features and aspects hereof, one or more PCDs during initialization listen to the defined synchronization channels to determine if any other PCD has begun transmitting the synchronization information (e.g., synchronization bit pattern). If no synchronization channels are presently transmitting synchronization information, the first PCD to achieve this level of initialization commences transmission of the standard synchronization bit pattern on an un-encoded synchronization channel. Each subsequent PCD proceeding through initialization will then detect another PCD already transmitting the synchronization sequence. Subsequent PCDs initializing may then synchronize to the first PCDs synchronization channel transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Since PCDs may enter and leave the proximity system, it may be advantageous for each PCD to generate and transmit the same synchronization information. Thus, if any one or more PCDs leave the system, the remaining PCDs will be assured of having a continuing source of synchronization information. Alternatively, each PCD may simply monitor the synchronization channel so as to assure continued transmission of synchronization information generated form at least one of the PCDs of the system. When a PCD detects that the synchronization channel is no longer transmitting synchronization information, the first to so detect may assume the responsibility and commence generation and transmission of such information. More generally, any number of the PCDs in the system may join in the transmission of the same synchronization information on the PCD SCH channel. One, all, or any predetermined maximum number of PCDs may participate in the generation and transmission of synchronization information. Still further, multiple synchronization channels may be provided. For example, in accordance with 3GPP protocols, a first synchronization pattern on a channel may provide frame synchronization while a second channel may provide synchronization information for slot synchronization within a frame. Still further, each PCD may generate synchronization information from any of multiple timing sources. For example, a PCD that is equipped with GPS locator features and presently has access to a GPS signal may generate synchronization information derived from timing signals of the GPS signaling standards. Alternatively or in addition, timing signals derived from clock signals and circuits within each PCD, and therefore common to all PCDs in a proximity communication system, may be used to generate synchronization information.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one exemplary embodiment, synchronization information may be transmitted on multiple synchronization channels. One or more synchronization channels may transmit synchronization information derived from GPS signals received by the GPS receiver in suitably equipped PCDs while one or more synchronization channels may transmit locally derived synchronization information derived from a local timing source within each PCD. Therefore, PCDs wishing to establish a call connection may use any of the multiple synchronization channels that are available to both of the PCDs engaged in the call connection. For example, if any PCD in a desired call connection is GPS equipped and has access to a GPS signal to permit GPS derived synchronization information generation, the PCDs of that connection may use either the GPS derived synchronization information on one channel or may use the locally derived synchronization information on another channel. If instead, neither of the two PCDs desiring a call connection has GPS capability, or at least has no GPS signal available to assure generation of GPS based synchronization information, the two PCDs may utilize only the locally derived synchronization information on an appropriate channel. Details of an exemplary method for determining the synchronization channel to use in a call connection are discussed further herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With the PCD synchronization established to enable use a common control channel, element <b>408</b> is then operable to listen on a control channel for broadcast information from other PCDs in the proximity communication system. All PCDs may first listen for broadcast information for a period of time during initialization to obtain information about other PCDs in the communication system. As information broadcast from other PCDs is received, the information may be recorded in tables or memories associated with this PCD for later use. The tables may be indexed using the PTI of each PCD (e.g., the broadcast ID adopted by each PCD as part of its initialization) to allow rapid access to the broadcast information of each PCD.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">After a period of time listening for broadcast information from other PCDs, element <b>410</b> will determine whether any conflicts are detected in the generated initial information for this PCD and that of any other PCD received in the broadcast information. Conflicts may be detected in the PTI value (ID value) generated for this device or may be found in the spreading codes generated for use in transmissions to this PCD. If element <b>410</b> detects a conflict in this initial information, processing loops back to element generate new PTI and spreading codes and them listen again to detect any new possible conflicts.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When element <b>410</b> detects no conflict, element <b>412</b> broadcasts the initial information for this PCD on a common control channel&#x2014;i.e., a logical broadcast channel defined in the spread spectrum transmissions and shared by all PCDs to exchange such information. The broadcast information may include the PTI and the In-Link spreading codes generated for the initializing PCD as well as initial location information derived from tie locator component of the PCD. Element <b>414</b> then commences normal operation of the PCD having completed initialization. Normal operation may continue periodic broadcasts of the updated current location information as well as the initial PTI and spreading codes generated above. Further details of exemplary normal operation are provided herein below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As noted above, multiple synchronization channels may be defined among the various PCDs in a system. Further the multiple channels may provide timing or synchronization information derived from any of multiple timing sources. As noted above, some or all of the PCDs may include GPS features. GPS features, in addition to providing accurate location information (via longitude, latitude and altitude), are known to provide an accurate timing signal that may be relied upon worldwide for many timing synchronization purposes. One synchronization channel may therefore carry GPS derived synchronization information so long as at least one PCD in the system is GPS equipped and is presently receiving GPS signals. Another synchronization channel may carry locally derived synchronization information&#x2014;derived from clock circuits local to every PCD of the system. Thus one or more synchronization channels may be available to PCDs wishing to establish a call connection. Where all PCDs engaging in a call connection (typically two devices in a peer-to-peer connection) sense the presence of GPS derived synchronization information on a corresponding synchronization channel, the two devices may use either the GPS derived or locally derived synchronization information on the available synchronization channels. If any of the PCDs wishing to establish a call connection do not sense any GPS derived synchronization information, the PCDs will establish a call using only the locally derived synchronization information. This locally derived synchronization information is, in essence, a least common source of synchronization information. The PCDs may then also monitor the other synchronization channels to determine if more accurate GPS derived synchronization information becomes available.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flowchart describing additional details of the processing of element <b>406</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to establish synchronization channels among the plurality of PCDs in the system. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> (element <b>406</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is operable in initialization of each PCD in the system. Further, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that such synchronization channel initialization may be repeated any as the system is used to assure establishment of proper synchronization channels. For example, if devices enter or leave the system or acquire or lose reception of GPS signals, the generation and use of synchronization information may need to be re-initialized.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Element <b>1000</b> is first operable to determine whether this PCD has GPS features and is presently receiving a GPS signal. If not, processing continues with element <b>1006</b> below.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If this PCD is GPS equipped and has access to a GPS signal, element <b>1002</b> is next operable to sense whether a sufficient number of other PCDs have already commenced transmission of GPS derived synchronization information on the pre-defined GPS synchronization channels. As a matter of design choice, all PCDs or any predetermined maximum number (&#x201c;N&#x201d;) of the PCDs may be responsible for generating GPS derived synchronization information for use by the PCDs in the system. If a sufficient number (N) of PCDs are generating and transmitting GPS derived synchronization information, processing continues with element <b>1006</b>. If an insufficient number (N) of PCDs are presently generating GPS derived synchronization information, element <b>1004</b> is operable to commence such generation and transmission of GPS derived synchronization information on an appropriate, pre-defined, GPS derived synchronization channel. Processing then continues with element <b>1006</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As noted, any number of PCDs may also transmit locally derived synchronization information on corresponding, pre-defined non-GPS derived synchronization channels. Locally derived synchronization information may be generated from local timing source signals (e.g., a clock or timer circuit of other clock signal circuits within every PCD). As above, all PCDs or any predetermined maximum number (&#x201c;N&#x201d;) of the PCDs may be responsible for generating non-GPS derived (locally derived) synchronization information for use by the PCDs in the system. Element <b>1006</b> is then operable to determine whether a sufficient number of PCDs have commenced transmission of locally derived synchronization information. If a sufficient number of PCDs are already generating the non-GPS synchronization information, this PCD need not do so and element <b>406</b> processing completes. Otherwise, element <b>1008</b> is operable to commence transmission of locally derived (non-GPS derived) synchronization information on a corresponding synchronization channel.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any number (N) of PCDs may be intended to generate the synchronization information (either GPS derived or locally derived). The determination of &#x201c;N&#x201d; may be a design choice for the needs of a particular application of the PCDs. If N is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, the first PCD to reach that level of initialization will start generating and transmitting the desired synchronization information. However, if that PCD leaves the system, synchronization could be temporarily lost until some other PCD senses the absence of synchronization information and re-initializes to start generation and transmission of the desired synchronization information. Thus it may be preferred in some exemplary applications to permit multiple PCDs to generate and transmit desired synchronization information. Where multiple PCDs are allowed to generate and transmit the synchronization information, the first PCD to do so establishes an arbitrary start for the periodic synchronization information transmission. Second and subsequent PCDs will sense the presence of transmitted synchronization information and will join in the generation and transmission substantially aligning its periodic transmissions with that of the first PCD. Thus the substantially aligned, multiple transmissions of the synchronization information (i.e., an un-encoded bit sequence) will not interfere with other transmissions. Rather, the multiple transmissions will be minimally interfering with one another or even additive in the resulting radio frequency modulated signal representing the synchronization information. Where the multiple PCDs are all generating and transmitting GPS derived synchronization information, they may all agree by design to transmit the desired information at a designated time (e.g., at that start of each second, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As discussed further herein below, establishment of a call connection may select an appropriate synchronization channel from among the plurality of synchronization channels. Further, the availability of synchronization information on synchronization channels may vary over time such as when PCDs enter or leave the proximity communication system area or GPS signals are lost for GPS equipped PCDs. For example, if no PCDs remain in the system that have GPS features or have access to GPS signals, all PCDs in the system will have to rely solely on the locally derived synchronization channels in establishing call connections. Thus when establishing a call connection, the PCDs desiring the connection will determine at that time the preferred synchronization channel to rely on, preferably for the duration of the call.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> describes two methods operable substantially in parallel and in combination representing exemplary normal operation of a PCD following completion of initialization. A first method represented by elements <b>500</b> through <b>504</b> maintains synchronization for communication on the control channel and also updates user equipment broadcast information (&#x201c;UBI&#x201d;) regarding location and other parameters associated with each PCD in the proximity communication system. A second method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> operable substantially in parallel with the first method is represented as elements <b>510</b> through <b>540</b> to allow establishment of call connections between this PCD and one or more other PCDs in the proximity communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Elements of <b>500</b> through <b>504</b> represent a method operable in an initialized PCD to maintain synchronization and to update exchanged broadcast information on a control channel shared by all PCDs in the proximity communication system. Element <b>500</b> is operable to listen for updates to the broadcast information from other PCDs. As noted, new PCDs may join the proximity communication system from time to time. Element <b>500</b> is therefore operable to listen to the control channel for such broadcast information regarding new PCDs and to detect the absence of broadcast information from PCDs previously participating in the proximity communication system. As information is derived from listening for broadcast updates by element <b>500</b>, tables within the PCD are updated to reflect the updated broadcast information. Element <b>502</b> is then operable to periodically re-synchronize communications on the control channel. As noted above, in a proximity communication system in accordance with features and aspects hereof, there is no central server or cellular base station to maintain synchronization for all communication devices. Rather, all or any number of the PCDs participating in the proximity communication system transmit at scheduled intervals the locally derived synchronization pattern on one or more synchronization channels of the system. One or more other PCDs that are GPS equipped (and are presently receiving GPS signals) may also generate and transmit at scheduled intervals the GPS derived synchronization information on corresponding channels. As new PCDs are added to the communication system and undergo initialization or as devices leave the system, it is assured that there is always an appropriate number of PCDs generating the necessary synchronization information to permit ongoing operation. Thus, element <b>502</b> is operable in each PCD to monitor the presence of required synchronization information on corresponding synchronization channels and to re-initialize operation of synchronization channels as required in response to changes in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Element <b>504</b> is then operable to periodically broadcast updated location and other information from this PCD to all other PCDs and the proximity communication system. The broadcast information is transmitted on a control channel so that other PCDs listening for such updated broadcast information may receive the information on the control channel. Processing then continues looping back to element <b>500</b> to continuously iterate through listening for updated information, maintaining synchronization on the control channel, and periodically updating location and other information regarding this PCD.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As noted above, the broadcast of element <b>504</b> may also be encoded using an application specific scrambling code in secure applications. Every PCD in such secure application will know the pre-determined application specific scrambling code to allow decoding of the broadcast information. Unauthorized users or devices will be practically incapable of decoding such scrambled, broadcast information. Additional well known security techniques may be employed to secure the broadcast from eavesdropping by other PCDs in the system that should not be permitted to eavesdrop on certain information in the system. For example, pre-defined, application-specific scrambling codes may be defined as having a tree structured relationship with one another or other hierarchical relationship. A device using a particular application-specific scrambling code defined in such a hierarchical structure is understood to have security clearance or permission to use that code plus any other hierarchically lower in the structure. Scrambling codes that are hierarchically higher in such a structure are not permitted for use by that PCD and may remain unknown to that PCD. Thus, for example, emergency first responder, military, or other high security applications of the proximity communication system features hereof may provide secure channels of communication that roughly mirror the hierarchical structure of the organization and its security. Thus higher level managers or officers at a site maybe assigned a hierarchically higher application specific scrambling code such that that PCD can also descramble all the broadcast information that uses hierarchically lower scrambling codes. However, lower level workers, officers, or soldiers at a site may be assigned a hierarchically lower application specific scrambling code for their broadcasts and thus will not be permitted to descramble the broadcasts of their superiors at the site.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Substantially in parallel with the method described above, elements <b>510</b> through <b>540</b> are operable to manage the call connection process. Element <b>510</b> is first operable in response to detecting some event requesting establishment of a new call connection between this PCD and one or more other PCDs. Element <b>510</b> determines whether the detected event is a request from a user of this PCD to make a call connection with one or more other PCDs or whether the detected event is a request from a remote PCD attempting to establish a call connection with this PCD. If the request is a user request, element <b>520</b> is operable to initiate a call connection process to the PCD identified by the user input based upon location information and optionally identified by other attributes of the identified PCD. As noted above, user input to request such a call connection may typically be in the form of selecting a PCD based upon location information associated with each PCD in the proximity communication system. Other attributes such as capabilities or features associated with the PCD, a username or other identification associated with the user of the PCD, etc., may be included as other selection criteria in the user's selection process. Further, the user may select multiple PCDs with which a call connection is to be established. Multiple selected PCDs may receive identical data transmissions (voice or non-voice data) from this PCD by a multicast or duplicate transmission to each of the multiple selected PCDs.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Once element <b>520</b> has completed establishing the requested call connection to one or more other identified PCDs, element <b>540</b> is then operable to exchange user data via the established connections. Communication with multiple PCDs may involve duplicating the transmitted data to each of the multiple PCDs connected to this PCD by operation of element <b>520</b>. When element <b>540</b> has completed its exchange of user information or data, a final message may be sent to all PCDs involved in the established connection or connections to request tearing down of the establish connection. Tearing down an establish connection entails freeing the various private communication channels established by operation of element <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">If element <b>510</b> determines that the detected event is a request from a remote PCD to establish the call connection with that remote PCD, element <b>530</b> is operable to appropriately respond to the remote request for a call connection. Having thus established the requested call connection, element <b>540</b> is then operable as discussed above to commence exchange of user information or data via the established logical channels of the connection. As noted above, upon completion of all user data exchange, a final tear down message may be sent to the logical channel to release logical channels and other resources consumed or defined by establishment of the channel connection.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that dedicated logical channels used to communicate between this PCD and one or more selected PCDs may be established by generating scrambling codes in element <b>520</b> at the time of selecting the PCDs with which to communicate. Regardless of when the scrambling codes are defined, the codes are exchanged between the PCDs to be connected in a call as part of the call connection setup exchange. These exchanges define the logical channels to be used for each communicating pair of PCDs.</p>

Element <b>600</b> is first operable to select an appropriate synchronization channel for establishing a call connection to one or more identified other PCDs. As noted above, any number of the PCDs in the system may include GPS features and, if they are receiving GPS signals, may have established a GPS derived synchronization channel. In all cases, one or more PCDs in the system have established a locally derived synchronization channel. One or more of these various synchronization channels may be usable by the PCDs to be connected in this call connection. If both devices sense the presence of the GPS derived synchronization information, then any of the synchronization channels may be selected for this call connection. If any of the PCDs to be connected in the call do not presently sense the GPS synchronization information in the system, then the locally generated synchronization information will be used in establishing this call connection. Where a PCD will be establishing multiple connections (e.g., a three way call connection or, in effect, a &#x201c;multi-cast&#x201d; to multiple PCDs, different synchronization channels may be used in each of the multiple call connections.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Using the selected synchronization channels, element <b>602</b> sends a connection request to each of the one or more identified other PCDs. The connection request message is encoded using the In-Link spreading code of each identified other PCD. The In-Link scrambling code from each other PCD may be determined based upon the table of information stored within this PCD and gathered by applying an application specific scrambling code to the broadcast information during initialization of PCDs in the proximity communication system. As noted above, if multiple PCDs are identified for establishing call connections, element <b>600</b> transmits a connection request to each such PCD to request a peer-to-peer connection with each other identified PCD. Element <b>604</b> then awaits receipt of an acknowledgement message from each other PCD to which a request was sent indicating acceptance of the request. This message may be scrambled using the In-Link scrambling code of the first or requesting PCD. As noted above, the In-Link code of each PCD may be included in the initially broadcast information regarding each PCD. Element <b>606</b> then sends a connection setup message to each of the other PCDs that have acknowledged the connection request. The setup message provides various parameters of the desired connection so that both this PCD and each identified other PCD may configure the communication layers for proper operation during the establish call connection. Lastly, element <b>608</b> awaits reception of a setup confirmation message from each identified other PCD confirming proper configuration of the requested call connection. Thus this PCD (operating the method of element <b>520</b>) has established a requested call connection with each of the one or more identified other PCDs. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize useful error recovery procedures should any aspect of the exchange fail to establish the desired connections.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As noted above, a PCD may establish multiple call connection for a particular communication exchange&#x2014;e.g., in effect a multi-party call connection or a &#x201c;multi-cast&#x201d; involving multiple PCD call connections. The PCD establishing the multiple connections repeats the steps above for each desired call connection. Logical channels are established between this initiating PCD and each of the other PCDs. Synchronization channels are selected for each such call connection.</p>

Element <b>700</b> is operable in response to receipt of a call connection request message to return a confirmation/acknowledgment message to the requesting PCD indicating ability to establish a desired call connection. If the PCD is presently unable to establish the requested call connection (e.g., busy with other tasks or exchanges, or configured by user input to reject requests from one or more identified PCDs, etc.), a rejection message (not shown) may be returned or the request may simply be ignored. Element <b>702</b> is then operable to await a connection setup message from the requesting PCD to provide parameters of the requested call connection. Lastly, element <b>704</b> is operable to configure the required protocol layers in accordance with the connection setup message and to return a setup confirmation message to the requesting PCD to indicate successful establishment of the requested connection. Having so successfully completed the connection request, the first and second PCDs may commence exchange of user data as described above.</p>

Element <b>800</b> is first operable to send user data to another PCD having a data channel established in response to the request and confirmation return messages in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> above. The exchange of user data by element <b>800</b> is performed on a data channel associated with the initiating PCD. The scrambling codes generated and exchanged between the communicating PCDs are used to encode the transmissions to each PCD. Where multiple call connections are requested and established, element <b>800</b> represents the exchange of data duplicated over multiple dedicated channels between the various multiple pairs of connected PCD pairs. Further, as noted above, upon completion of the exchange of user data, element <b>800</b> may also operate to transmit a tear down message to the PCDs involved in established connections. The tear down message is processed by each receiving PCD by the deallocating resources allocated for the call connection.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The processing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> represent a simplified call processing message protocol to establish and terminate a call connection between two PCDs. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any suitable call processing messaging protocol may be employed in the proximity communication system hereof. A call processing protocol provides a number of messages for establishing and destroying a call connection between a PCD and one or more other PCDs. For example, standard cellular telephony call processing protocols as well as standards published by 3GPP provide such call processing messaging protocols. Though these standard call processing protocols are rich with features not needed in the proximity communication features and aspects hereof, simplified subsets of these standard protocols may be used to provide useful call connection processing features and aspects hereof. As a matter of design choice, these standard protocols may be used or modified or a customized protocol structure may be developed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">3GPP and other telecommunication standards define a number of logical and physical channels useful in the call processing protocols. Several of these standard channel definitions may be useful in the proximity communication features and aspects hereof.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In general, a control channel is used to exchange commands and control information between two PCDs while a data or traffic channel is used to exchange application or user data (i.e., voice data and non-voice data in the proximity communication system). Control and other standard channels may be encoded using channelization codes as generally defined by 3GPP and other standards. In general, dedicated channels are encoded using the source separation or scrambling code associated with the receiving PCD in a requested or established connection. Non-dedicated channels utilize a channelization code known to all PCDs of the system and may thus be shared by all PCDs. The synchronization channels (SCH(1) . . . SCH(N)) and broadcast channel (BCH) are examples of un-encoded non-dedicated channels shared by all PCDs in the proximity communication system hereof. The SCHs may be used for a periodic transmission of a standard synchronization bit patterns. The BCH channel may be used to broadcast location and other information about each PCD for consumption by all PCDs in the proximity communication system. The traffic channel (DTCH) may be used by PCDs after establishment of a connection to exchange user data. The common control channel (CCCH) may be a channel shared by all PCDs in the system for, among other things, transmitting a call connection request message. The dedicated control channel (DCCH) may be used in establishing a connection for control messages following the transmission on CCCH of the connect request.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram providing another form of description of an exemplary protocol defined for the proximity communication system in accordance with features and aspects hereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> represents a timeline presentation of PCD initialization, call connection establishment, and data exchange through an established connection. In the timeline diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, time is advancing downward in the figure. A vertical line labeled PCD<b>1</b> represents processing associated with the PCD desiring to initiate the call connection while the vertical line labeled PCD<b>2</b> represents processing associated with the recipient of a connection request. Box <b>900</b> represents processing performed by all PCDs of a proximity communication system. All PCDs in a proximity communication system initialize themselves by first establishing the device specific broadcast information (UBI) for its configuration. As noted above, the UBI may include the first phase scrambling code used for communicating with this PCD as well as location information indicating that initial location of the corresponding PCD and other attributes and indicia useful in selecting a PCD to establish a call connection. After the system is powered up and all the information for signal and call processing is set-up in each PCD, a call is initiated by a requesting (e.g., calling) PCD (PCD<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). As noted above, for purposes of this exemplary exchange, 3GPP well known channels may be utilized. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that any desirable logical channel definitions may be employed. 3GPP standards merely supply one common, well known architecture in which features and aspects hereof may be advantageously implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, the SCH provides a well known offset into the Primary Common Control Physical Channel (PCCPCH) that all PCDs access to transmit and receive location and other PCD specific information (i.e., information encoded as the UBI structure). This is a scrambled channel&#x2014;scrambled with an authorized application-specific scrambling code that is specific to the type of PCD. In the context of a secured proximity communication system, the PCCPCH would be scrambled with a private secure scrambling code to which unsecured PCD users will not have access. The PCD then &#x201c;tunes&#x201d; itself to the PCCPCH to obtain the location information of other PCDs within radio range. Along with transmission of the UBI during initialization, PCDs also transmit corresponding offset for the Secondary Common Control Physical Channel (SCCPCH). The scrambling code that is received in the UBI of a far-end device is used to scramble a Connection Request Message (as discussed below). The receiving PCD then has to just &#x201c;tune&#x201d; itself to its SCCPCH offset and apply its In-Link scrambling code to decode the request.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A PCD (e.g., PCD<b>1</b>), when setting up a call, makes a request for connection to another PCD (e.g., PCD<b>2</b>) as indicated by box <b>901</b>. It sends a Connection Request Message over the Secondary Common Physical Control Channel (SCCPCH) as indicated by arrow <b>902</b>. The request message is carried on the CCCH (the request is scrambled using the secondary device-specific scrambling code provided by PCD<b>2</b>). The request may provide&#x2014;Connection Type&#x2014;e.g., voice or packet data.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in box <b>903</b> and arrow <b>904</b>, PCD<b>2</b> then responds by encoding its response message (on its Out-Link) with the secondary In-Link device-specific scrambling code of PCD<b>1</b>. The acknowledgement message is encoded on the CCCH logical channel carried by the SCCPCH. This response Connection Ack Message can have an unconditional/conditional accept/reject indicia (e.g., accepted or rejected conditional on a lower/higher data rate or on a third party call-flag, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In response to receipt of the acknowledgement (with any conditional parameters indicated), PCD<b>1</b> then configures its upper layer protocol stacks based on the accept message from PCD<b>2</b> as indicated by box <b>905</b> and sends a Connection Setup Message which directs PCD<b>2</b> to correspondingly configure its upper layer protocol stacks as indicated by box <b>906</b> and arrow <b>907</b>. PCD<b>1</b> also transmits a dedicated tertiary scrambling code information that it will then use to read all dedicated messages on its In-Link. The Connection Setup Message can contain the following details:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0096">Parameters of its own Dedicated Physical Control Channel DPCCH (multiplexed onto the Dedicated Physical Channel DPCH) after configuration of its upper layer protocol stacks.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0097">Indicia of a Dedicated Transport Channel (DCH).</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0098">Indicia of a Logical Dedicated Control Channel DCCH (that will be carried on the Dedicated Physical Control Channel DPCCH that is multiplexed onto the Dedicated Physical Channel DPCH).</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0100">Responsive to the setup message, PCD<b>2</b> uses these parameters to configure its own protocol layers by establishing its protocol stacks and transport and logical channels based on the request as indicated by box <b>908</b>. Specifically PCD<b>2</b> may:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0105">PCD<b>2</b> then transmits this information as a Connection Complete message as indicated by box <b>909</b> and arrow <b>910</b> scrambled with the tertiary dedicated scrambling code of PCD<b>1</b>, over the DCCH that is multiplexed over Dedicated Physical Control Channel. PCD<b>1</b> may then establish its traffic transport and logical channels for exchanging traffic data. The two scrambling codes exchanged during signaling will be used for transmission over the dedicated traffic channels. Each PCD will scramble its Out-Link messages with the tertiary dedicated In-Link scrambling code of the receiver. Arrows <b>911</b> and <b>912</b> represent ongoing exchanges of information between the two PCDs during the established call connection.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0106">After two devices setup a call connection they may perform power control algorithms (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) to make sure other devices closer to one of the communicating PCDs do not drown the signal from the other communicating PCD of this connection. Those of ordinary skill will recognize that this power control tuning is different from the well known use of a constant strength beacon signal that is used for location estimation by triangulation. Well known signal processing of a constant strength beacon signal from each of at least two other wireless devices may be used to locate a device as discussed above where the device is devoid of GPS or other direct locator circuits. The above noted power control tuning is performed on the carrier signals used for exchange of information rather than the beacon signals used in such location estimations.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0107">When a PCD terminates the call connection, a tear down message is sent from the disconnecting device to the far end device such as indicated by arrow <b>913</b>. It will be understood that either side of the connection may decide to end the connection and issue the tear down message to the other device. When this message is received, all the channels and dedicated random codes are purged and the links dropped. The In-Link scrambling codes and other PCD specific information may be maintained until the unit is powered off and then re-established upon power up initialization and call connection establishment. Channelization codes for the various dedicated and common control and traffic channels are pre-defined in the system and may use standard definitions such as in 3GPP or other industry specifications. For a multi-way connection, the traffic packets are duplicated and scrambled using the multiple tertiary dedicated scrambling codes for each of the receivers and transmitted on the Dedicated Traffic Channel. The signaling for this process is similar to the steps given above, except the coordination occurs among all participating devices. If the participating devices are synchronized differently, they will transmit information at the appropriate slot/frame boundaries the same as the far end device. It should be noted that devices continue to transmit their location and attribute information on the common channels both when devices are idle and when they are in call. If a device receives two or more call connection requests at the same time, the appropriate caller information is displayed on the device giving the receiving user the option to select one or more of the calling devices. No handoffs are needed such as in cellular telephony because the PCDs do not traverse any network elements. If the signal strength becomes weak as the two devices move farther apart, the call is automatically terminated. This does not present a very crucial shortcoming since most calls originating from a PCD are typically for a short duration and for a short distance.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0108">Though the exemplary exchange of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> suggests use of specific channels and specific scrambling codes, these are intended merely as exemplary of one possible call connection in accordance with features and aspects hereof. Any number of channels and or scrambling codes may be used for such a connection. Thus one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize a wide variety of particular channels and/or scrambling codes (i.e., spreading codes and techniques) to establish and utilize a peer-to-peer connection between any pair of communicating PCDs.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0109">Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the exemplary, simplified call connection protocol discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 10</figref> are merely intended as suggestive of one possible protocol useful in the proximity communication system providing features and aspects hereof Numerous equivalent protocols may be designed as a matter of design choice or existing call processing protocols such as cellular telephony call processing protocols may be utilized. However, extraneous additional features in the cellular telephony call processing protocol not required for this simpler application may simply be ignored and a small subset of standardized call processing messages can be utilized. Alternatively, a larger, richer subset of call processing features may be adopted in the proximity communication system to permit further enhanced features. Further, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any suitable collection of logical and physical channels may be defined for the connection between any two PCDs.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0110">Various exemplary embodiments of the proximity communication system features and aspects hereof have been presented above with respect to voice and/or data communication systems. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also recognize applicability of features and aspects hereof to a wireless gaming environment. In other words, a plurality of PCDs may be used in a system where the purpose of the communications is to permit multi-player gaming. Each PCD may present video game interface capabilities to its user and the PCDs may exchange data (and/or voice) to provide wireless, multi-player gaming. All such gaming devices (PCDs) in the area may participate in accordance with any desired security features to exchange information among the various players of the multiplayer game.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0111">The structures and methods above describe exemplary communication structures and methods for a system of PCDs. As discussed, other PCDs in the proximity of a first PCD are identified by the first PCD primarily by their relative location to the first PCD and by other attributes of the other PCDs. A variety of convenient user display features are provided by features and aspects hereof for display on the first PCD of information regarding the system as a whole, information regarding the PCDs near the first PCD, and other information for a user of the first PCD. For example, each other PCD in the proximity of the first PCD may be presented on the display of the first PCD with a unique icon or glyph. The icon or glyph image could be provided by each PCD as part of its broadcast information or may be entered by the PCD user in a setup or configuration mode. The relative position of all other PCDs on the first PCD display screen may be dynamically updated as each PCD moves about within the system. As noted above, all attributes and information regarding a PCD may be stored in tables of the presenting PCD and indexed by the PTI (temporary ID) of each other PCD. The PCD presenting the display could be positioned at the center of the display screen and the relative location of all other PCDs may be presented displaced from that center proportionate to their relative location to this PCD. The icon/glyph and/or attributes of nearby PCDs displayed on the screen of each PCD may overlay a map such as a street map or topographic terrain map to visually aid the user in locating nearby PCDs. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also recognize that a simple list of textual information may be used to present information about any other PCD. The displayed positions of PCDs could be scaled to an area of interest. In other words, the scale of the distances displayed on the user's PCD display screen could be zoomed in or out to include a larger or smaller area of the locale in the display (e.g., more PCDs within a wider range or fewer other PCDs within a narrower range).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0112">The broadcast information from each PCD could also identify useful attributes of the PCD for use by all receiving devices. Thus, for example, a user's PCD could display attribute information for all PCDs in its proximity. Attributes could include, for example, labels such as &#x201c;Police&#x201d;, &#x201c;Fireman&#x201d;, &#x201c;EMT&#x201d;, &#x201c;Artillery&#x201d;, &#x201c;Commander&#x201d;, &#x201c;Restaurant&#x201d;, &#x201c;Gas Station&#x201d;, &#x201c;Cab&#x201d;, etc. These and other attributes may be displayed persistently on the display of the receiving PCD or may be displayed at the user's request such as when a user points to a PCD displayed on its display screen (e.g., using a pointing device interface on the PCD such as a stylus).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0113">The display on each PCD may also be presented in a number of levels or layers. A first layer may present nearby PCDs with their respective location information (e.g., relative location from this PCD as presented graphically according to current &#x201c;zoom&#x201d; scaling). Another layer display may be presented when a user selects (e.g., points to) a particular PCD. The display may then shift to an information display regarding the selected PCD. Attributes and other information regarding that PCD may then be presented and a &#x201c;back&#x201d; button or selection can restore the display to the earlier display of relative locations of all other PCDs. Still further, a layer or level of the display may be selected to present capabilities attributes associated with all PCDs in the system or with respect to a selected PCD on the user's display. Capabilities may include features such as &#x201c;voice communication capable&#x201d;, &#x201c;data communication capable&#x201d;, &#x201c;game/packet connection capable&#x201d;, &#x201c;Game X compatible&#x201d;, &#x201c;email capable&#x201d;, &#x201c;text message capable&#x201d;, &#x201c;web client/host capable&#x201d;, etc. Yet another layer may be selected to compute and display a measure of the distance between this PCD and a selected other PCD on the display or between two selected PCDs on the display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0114">Still further, when the system is used to present multi-player game applications, the displays of all PCDs engaged in a current game will be coordinated to assure a substantially similar display on all devices.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0115">The PCD display may also include user configuration and filtering features to permit the user to configure how many other PCDs to display or which particular types to include or exclude from display. A user may simply configure a maximum number &#x201c;X&#x201d; of PCDs to display. The first X other PCDs will then be displayed selected based upon configurable selection criteria. For example, a user may configure a PCD to display only the X closest PCDs. Or a user may define a filter indicating only other PCDs that are &#x201c;Game X compatible&#x201d; or &#x201c;Game Y compatible&#x201d; or only &#x201c;Police&#x201d; PCDs, etc. be displayed. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize a wide variety of filter conditions and configurations to permit a user to customize the display presented so that only PCDs &#x201c;of interest&#x201d; to the user will be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0116">While the invention has been illustrated and described in the drawings and foregoing description, such illustration and description is to be considered as exemplary and not restrictive in character. One embodiment of the invention and minor variants thereof have been shown and described. Protection is desired for all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate variations of the above-described embodiments that fall within the scope of the invention. In particular, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that features and aspects hereof may be implemented equivalently in electronic circuits or as suitably programmed instructions of a general or special purpose processor. Such equivalency of circuit and programming designs is well known to those skilled in the art as a matter of design choice. As a result, the invention is not limited to the specific examples and illustrations discussed above, but only by the following claims and their equivalents.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Swiss Patent Application No. 0904/03 filed May 21, 2003, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention concerns in general a portable instrument for measuring a physiological quantity (for example the heart rhythm) arranged to be brought into contact with the surface of an organic tissue (for example skin) including, essentially disposed in a same plane, an illumination device including at least one light source of a determined illumination surface for subjecting a portion of the organic tissue to a luminous emission in at least one determined wavelength range, and a detection device remote from the illumination device for detecting the intensity of the luminous emission produced by the illumination device after propagation in the organic tissue. The present invention concerns more particularly such a measurement instrument capable of being worn on the wrist, for example in the form of an instrument having a similar configuration to a wristwatch.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such portable measuring instruments are already known. These portable devices are particularly employed for detecting, by optical means, the heart rhythm and/or the level of oxygen in a patient's blood. They are found in various forms ranging from clamps intended to be placed on a zone of the human body (typically on the end of a finger, on the earlobe or any other extremity of the human body sufficiently irrigated by blood) to devices worn on the wrist having a similar appearance to a wristwatch.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Within the scope of an application to measurement of the heart rhythm, the illumination device is used for generating adequate illumination of a part of the organic tissue (typically the skin) and is associated with one or several photoreceptors for detecting the intensity of the luminous emission produced by the illumination device after propagation in the organic tissue. Variations in the blood flow pulsation induce a variation in the absorption of the luminous emission produced by the illumination device, the frequency of the absorption variation essentially corresponding to the frequency of the heart pulsations. Detection of the intensity of the luminous emission after propagation in the organic tissue accompanied by adequate processing of the measurement signal or signals enables to extract an indication of the heart rhythm. The illumination devices commonly used for this type of application are relatively simple and typically consist of one or several quasi-punctual light sources. They are typically LEDs (light emitting diodes) emitting within a determined wavelength range. The detection devices commonly include one or several photoreceptors formed for example of photodiodes or phototransistors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">US Patent Application No. 2002/0188210 A1 discloses for example a portable heart rhythm detection instrument intended to be worn on the inner part of the wrist, in proximity to the wrist artery. In this example, it is proposed, in particular, to arrange several photoreceptors around a single light emitting diode. Alternatively, it is further proposed to dispose several light emitting diodes around a single photoreceptor, this alternative however being undesirable because of the increase in energy consumption and the proportional increase in manufacturing and construction costs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In all cases, the light source or sources are, as already mentioned, quasi-punctual sources whose cone or emitting surface typically only covers an area of a few mm<sup>2</sup>. This reduced emitting or illumination surface has a drawback for applications requiring illumination of an organic tissue insofar as the organic tissue has so to speak systematically localised zones where the degree of light emission absorption differs greatly from neighbouring zones. In the case of illumination of a user's skin for example, moles, hairs or other localised modifications in the epidermis can thus cause a significant variation in the light emission absorption and have a negative influence on the quality of measurement of the desired physiological quantity. Any relative movements between the measuring device and the illuminated organic tissue further add to the degradation of the measurement quality. It will be understood that these problems also arise in relation to the detection device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is thus desirable to illuminate the organic tissue surface more uniformly and over a larger area in order to reduce or minimise as far as possible the influence of these localised &#x201c;defects&#x201d; in the illuminated tissue. One solution might consist in multiplying the light sources to cover a larger area of the organic tissue. As already mentioned with reference to US document No. 2002/0188210 A1 hereinbefore, this solution is not, however essentially desirable for reasons of energy consumption and costs. It should however be noted that the increase in the number of light sources also generates connection and construction problems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is desirable alternatively or by way of complement, to pick up the light emission emanating from the organic tissue after propagation in the latter over a wider area in order to minimise the influence of localised defects on the signal detection quality.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a general object of the present invention thus to propose a portable measuring instrument for minimising the influence of localised defects in the organic tissue on the quality of illumination and/or detection of the light emission after propagation while keeping energy consumption as low as possible in order to make such a solution better suited for portable applications.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is another object of the present invention to propose a solution whose construction remains relatively simple and whose bulkiness, particularly the thickness, remains reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is yet another object of the present invention to propose a solution which optimises as far as possible the available surface on the instrument to assure the widest possible illumination of the organic tissue and/or to assure detection of the light emission after propagation in the organic tissue over a wide area.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention thus concerns an instrument for measuring a physiological quantity as mentioned hereinbefore whose features are set out in the first and second embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additional advantageous embodiments of the present invention form the subject of embodiments modifying the first and second embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a first embodiment of the present invention, a portable instrument for measuring a physiological quantity arranged to be brought into contact with the surface of an organic tissue is provided and includes, essentially arranged in a same plane: (a) an illumination device including at least one light source with a determined illumination surface for subjecting a portion of organic tissue to a light emission in at least one determined wavelength range; and (b) a detection device distant from the illumination device for detecting the intensity of the light emission produced by the illumination device after propagation in the organic tissue, wherein the illumination device includes an optical element forming a guide coupled to the at least one light source for guiding the light emission from the source by total internal reflection in a substantially parallel direction to the surface of the organic tissue to be illuminated and for distributing light emission into several determined illumination zones on the surface of the organic tissue over a substantially broader area than the illumination surface of the light source. According to the solution proposed by the first embodiment, the portable measuring instrument is thus provided with an illumination device including an optical element forming a guide coupled to at least one light source for guiding the light emission of the source by total internal reflection in a direction essentially parallel to the surface of the organic tissue to be illuminated and for distributing the light emission into several determined zones of the organic tissue surface over an area substantially greater than the illumination surface of the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a second embodiment of the present invention, a portable instrument for measuring a physiological quantity arranged to be brought into contact with the surface of an organic tissue is provided and includes, essentially arranged in a same plane: (a) an illumination device including at least one light source with a determined illumination surface for subjecting a portion of organic tissue to a light emission in at least one determined wavelength range; and (b) a detection device distant from the illumination device for detecting the intensity of the light emission produced by the illumination device after propagation in the organic tissue, wherein the detection device includes an optical element forming a guide coupled to at least one photoreceptor for picking up in several zones of the organic tissue surface the light emission produced by the illumination device after propagation in the organic tissue and for guiding the light emission by total internal reflection to the at least one photoreceptor. According to the alternative solution of the second embodiment, the detection device includes such an optical element, this time for picking up, in several zones of the organic tissue surface, the light emission produced by the illumination device after propagation in the organic tissue and for guiding this light emission by total internal reflection to at least one photoreceptor. These alternatives can advantageously be combined.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to advantageous variants of these solutions, the optical element is configured to have a branched structure and/or an at least partially cellular structure. Preferably, the illumination zones defined by the optical illumination guide are determined so as to be at a substantially constant distance from the closest point of the geometrical contour of the detection device. If the detection device is formed of one or several quasi-punctual photoreceptors, the optical element acting as optical guide advantageously has a structure whose geometry essentially coincides with an arc of a circle or a circle of predetermined radius around the position of each photoreceptor. A structure having essentially the form of a honeycomb structure is proposed in particular.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This solution optimises as far as possible the space available to assure adequate illumination of the organic tissue. The inventor was able to observe in fact that an optical element thus structured was particularly well suited to generating the required illumination assuring optimal detection of the desired physiological quantity. This solution allows the light flux produced by the light source or sources to be channeled in a successful and optimum manner in order to illuminate the organic tissue in a number of zones arranged in a determined manner in proximity to the detection device. This solution further favours optimisation of illumination for a given energy consumption. According to the solutions of the prior art, the light flux from the light sources is not, so to speak, channeled. This results in non-optimal illumination, not only in terms of distribution, but also in terms of energy consumption, since the light emission is propagated in any direction around the source. According to the present solution, the optical element can be structured such that the light emission emerging from the optical element illuminates the organic tissue at a predetermined angle in the direction of the detection device, thus optimising still further the use of the available energy.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It will be noted in particular, that the optical illumination guide can be structured so as to assure that the light emission emanating from the illumination device is close to a vertical line relative the organic tissue to be illuminated. This advantageously enables the organic tissue to be illuminated in depth while avoiding insofar as possible direct coupling between the illumination and detection devices. According to the solutions of the prior art, the drawback of the conventional light sources (particularly LEDs) lies in the non-oriented nature of the light emission generated, the light emission thus being propagated in all directions in the organic tissue. The use of an optical guide for illuminating the organic tissue enables the light emission to be channeled so that it is propagated in depth in the tissue. The use of an optical guide for detection likewise favours detection of the light emission originating from the depths of the illuminated organic tissue, to the detriment of any light emission which is propagated at the surface of the organic tissue and which is only slightly modulated by the blood flow.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a particularly desirable alternative embodiment, the optical element is a solid optical guide with micro-prismatic structures. More particularly, the optical element has a first face, or lower face, directed towards the organic tissue, a second face, or upper face, opposite the first face, and lateral faces joining the first and second faces, oriented essentially perpendicularly to the surface of the organic tissue. The micro-prismatic structures are arranged on the second face and/or the lateral faces in order to redirect the light emission through the first face in the direction of the organic tissue to be illuminated or respectively to redirect the light emission emanating from the organic tissue towards the associated photoreceptor or photoreceptors.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to assure illumination or detection that is as uniform and homogenous as possible, the length of the micro-prismatic structures and/or their number preferably increases progressively as one moves away from the light source, respectively from the associated photoreceptor, along the optical path of the light emission. These two alternatives are applicable independently of each other or in combination and have the advantage of compensating for the decrease in intensity of the light emission produced or picked up.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, for the illumination, each micro-prismatic structure has a first facet oriented in the direction from which the light emission from the light source originates and so as to redirect the light emission in the direction of the first face of the optical element. A similar structure can be adopted for detection of the light emission emanating from the organic tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first facet at least of each micro-prismatic structure can be coated with a reflective coating in order to increase the useful light flux for illumination or detection. More widespread parts of the walls of the optical element, such as the lateral walls or the upper wall of the optical element, could be coated with a reflective coating. It should be noted that by totally coating the surface where the micro-prismatic structures are arranged, the manufacturing cost premium can be reduced a little with respect to a selective coating of the micro-prismatic structures alone, but absorption losses due to the reflective surfaces are also increased.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to another variant, the illumination device includes first and second light sources producing light emissions in determined and distinct wavelength ranges, the optical guide being arranged to mix the light emissions from these first and second sources. The use of two distinct sources can be required in certain applications, particularly for detecting the heart rhythm or measuring the level of oxygen in the blood, where the differences in blood absorption are exploited at two distinct wavelengths. Typically, sources emitting in the red and infrared are used. Other wavelengths can also be exploited, such as yellow (approx. 590 nm) or green (approx. 480-530 nm), the choice essentially depending on the application.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">One advantage of this variant lies in the fact that the optical element plays not only the role of an optical guide but also the role of an optical &#x201c;mixer&#x201d; for distributing light emissions in a uniform manner over the same surface along two distinct wavelengths. The prior solutions using only quasi-punctual light sources, such as LEDs, have a considerable disadvantage in this regard wherein two distinct light sources can evidently not be arranged at the same location. This necessarily results in a spatial shift between the light sources of different wavelengths and thus potentially large absorption variations between these two positions, which may have a negative influence on the detection result.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Finally, the aforementioned portable measuring instrument is perfectly suited for use in an electronic instrument worn on the wrist. The solution proposed is particularly advantageous since the optical element of the illumination device has a relatively simple construction and a small thickness allowing it to be incorporated in the bottom of the case of the instrument in proximity to the user's skin.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The various embodiments that will now be presented are given purely by way of illustrative and non-limiting example. In particular, it should again be stressed that the embodiments that will be presented can advantageously but not uniquely be implemented in an instrument intended to be worn on the wrist. Other portable applications of these solutions may perfectly well be envisaged.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the embodiments illustrated in the Figures, it will be noted that a common point lies in the use of an illumination device including at least one light source coupled to a structured optical element forming a guide, this guide being structured in a determined manner as a function of geometry (in particular its periphery) and the arrangement of the detection device. As will be seen hereinafter, the detection device can also be provided with at least one optical element forming a guide coupled to at least one photoreceptor. By way of alternative, one could envisage, within the scope of the invention, providing only the detection device with such an optical guide and using one or several conventional light sources. The use of an optical guide for illumination is however preferable because of savings hoped for in terms of power consumption and distribution of the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It should be noted that solutions using optical guides to assure quasi-uniform illumination of a surface are already known, typically the surface of a support bearing markings or a display. European Patent Application No. EP 1 050 711 in the name of the present Applicant discloses for example an oriented illumination device of a surface by a guide provided with micro-prismatic structures. This illumination device is used for the sole purpose of illuminating a plane surface, such as the dial of a watch, the light emission emerging from lateral faces of the guide. The use of such an illumination device in an instrument for measuring a physiological quantity for the illumination of a portion of an organic tissue is neither, however, described, nor suggested.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Within the scope of the present invention, the optical element forming a guide will preferably be a solid optical guide with micro-prismatic structures, advantageously arranged in a hollow. The material forming this guide is preferably a translucent or transparent material with a high refractive index n (typically comprised between 1.40 and 1.65) selected from among well known organic polymers which allow at least part of the light energy admitted to one end from at least one light source to be propagated by total internal reflection along the guide. Such organic polymers are for example chosen from among the acrylic polymers, particularly polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polycarbonate and polyesters.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be noted that a diffusing medium could improve the homogeneity and uniformity of illumination in the case of the use and mixing of several light sources emitting within different wavelength ranges. One can however expect more significant losses in terms of light intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The optical guide could be structured by direct or indirect etching, such as mechanical machining with an appropriate tool, etching through photoresist masks, by chemical means or laser means, these techniques being cited by way of non-limiting example. It is also possible to structure the optical guide by replication from an etched die fitted to an injection machine to obtain the guides by moulding, or used for stamping a surface in which one wishes to shape the guide. Whichever technique is used, structuring can be carried out directly on the guide or on a plate with a substantially identical refractive index to that of the guide, which is subsequently applied to the actual guide, for example by bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As already mentioned hereinbefore, a reflective coating can be affixed onto certain facets of the optical guide in order to increase the useful light flux for illumination of the organic tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As regards the light source or sources, these will preferably be formed of quasi-punctual light sources, such as conventional light emitting diodes (LEDs) emitting within the desired wavelength range (e.g. AlGaAS diodes emitting at 650 nm or InGaN diodes emitting at 470 nm, etc.). The photoreceptor or photoreceptors of the detection device could for example be formed of photodiodes or phototransistors having an adequate response for the adopted wavelength range or ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a first embodiment of a measuring instrument according to the invention designated as a whole by the reference numeral <b>3</b>. The illumination device, designated by the reference numeral <b>1</b>, includes an optical element <b>10</b> forming an optical guide coupled to a light source (at least) <b>40</b> arranged here at the centre, designated C, of the structure and which is only partially visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the illumination device <b>1</b> is associated with a detection device <b>2</b> including three quasi-punctual photoreceptors <b>21</b> to <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The measuring instrument of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is for example intended for measuring the heart rhythm and its general appearance is similar to that of a wristwatch. This instrument <b>3</b> thus includes a case <b>30</b>, also forming the middle part, inside which there are arranged the various electric and electronic components (not shown) of the instrument as well as a wristband (not shown) attached to case <b>30</b> in a conventional manner, for example via horns <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> arranged on case <b>30</b>. The illumination device <b>1</b> and detection device <b>2</b> are arranged in a back cover <b>35</b> of the watch so as to come into contact with the user's skin. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> thus shows a plan view of the back cover side of instrument <b>3</b>. Back cover <b>35</b> preferably also has a peripheral rib, designated by the reference numeral <b>70</b>, the usefulness of which will be referred to more detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The illumination and detection devices could alternatively be disposed on another adapted portion of the portable instrument, for example on its upper face (in this case, the user would for example have to put one of his fingers on this upper face in order to carry out the measurement of the physiological quantity concerned).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to this first embodiment, it will be observed that the optical element <b>10</b> of illumination device <b>1</b> has a star-shaped branched structure including three substantially rectilinear branchings <b>11</b> to <b>13</b> extending essentially in the same plane along three directions displaced angularly by 120&#xb0; around the centre C of the structure. The three photoreceptors <b>21</b> to <b>23</b> of detection device <b>2</b> are disposed in this example in a symmetrical configuration on the bisecting lines of the angles formed by the three branchings <b>11</b> to <b>13</b>, thus along in three directions displaced angularly by 120&#xb0; around structure C. Branchings <b>11</b> to <b>13</b> and photoreceptors <b>21</b> to <b>23</b> are thus all alternated every 60&#xb0; approximately around the centre of the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">More precisely, the three photoreceptors <b>21</b> to <b>23</b> are disposed at an equal distance from centre C to form an equilateral triangle whose apex are formed by the three photoreceptors. With respect to these photoreceptors, optical element <b>10</b> is characterized by a branched geometry essentially following portions of the arc of a circle of determined radius R around the position of photoreceptors <b>21</b> to <b>23</b>. The distance separating two photoreceptors is thus equal to substantially two times the radius R. Branchings <b>11</b> to <b>13</b> of the optical element also have a mean width, designated L, which is constant here, whose value is chosen to be a fraction of radius R.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The selection of the value of radius R and the value of mean width L of the branchings of the optical element are dictated by various constraints. The inventor was able to observe that the mean distance separating each photoreceptor from the neighbouring branchings should remain substantially constant. In this particular example, this distance is determined on the one hand by the value of radius R and by the value of mean width L of the branchings. Too short a distance would result in photoreceptors <b>21</b> to <b>23</b> being in too close proximity with respect to illumination device <b>1</b>, preventing the light emission produced by the latter from penetrating the organic tissue sufficiently deeply and being sufficiently modulated by the variations in blood flow. Likewise, too great a distance would result in the photoreceptors being too far from illumination device <b>1</b> and would prevent detection of a signal of sufficient intensity. In practice, the inventor was able to observe that a distance of the order of less than ten millimeters was suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> demonstrates the foregoing. It can be seen schematically here that the mean local intensity decreases almost exponentially progressively as one moves away from the source. On the other hand, the light emission modulation rate after propagation in the organic tissue (the light emission being picked up by the detection device) increases progressively as one moves away from the source typically to stabilise from a certain distance. This change is essentially linked to the fact that the farther one moves away from the source, the more deeply the light emission will have penetrated the illuminated organic tissue and the more it will be modulated by the blood flow. Stabilisation or saturation of the modulation rate results from the fact that the distribution of the blood vessels varies up to a depth determined with respect to the surface of the organic tissue from which it becomes homogenous. A longer transmission path in the organic tissue consequently no longer contributes to increase the modulation rate.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The modulated intensity which essentially results from multiplication of the aforementioned two curves (curve in dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) thus has an amplitude peak as shown in the diagram. In order to optimise operation of the optical measuring device, an adequate spacing has thus to be selected between the illumination and detection devices that essentially coincides with this amplitude peak. This optimal distance (indicated by the hatched part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) varies as a function of the nature of the illuminate organic tissue and in particular of the depth at which the blood vessels are located. For use on the wrist, the inventor has determined that this distance is typically 10 mm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the case of an application to an electronic instrument worn on the wrist where the surface of the back cover in contact with the skin is typically of the order of ten cm<sup>2</sup>, it will be noted that, in practice, it is possible to arrange at little less than ten &#x201c;overlapped&#x201d; photoreceptors in an optical guide structured as proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be observed that the distance between each photoreceptor <b>21</b> to <b>23</b> and the neighbouring branchings is not strictly constant because of the rectilinear shape of branchings <b>11</b> to <b>13</b>. It should however be specified that strict respect for a constant distance between the photoreceptor and the optical guide is not in itself primordial. A certain tolerance is acceptable. It should also be specified that it is especially important to ensure that the optical guide is structured to inject and distribute the light emission from the source or sources into zones determined with respect to the positions of the photoreceptors. The optical guide itself could thus follow a geometry that does not necessarily respect a predetermined distance with respect to the geometry of the detection device.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The configuration of the illumination device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will now be examined more particularly, such configuration being detailed in the views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>is a partial enlarged view of optical element <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> seen from the side of its upper face, designated <b>10</b><i>b</i>, i.e. its face opposite face <b>10</b><i>a </i>intended to be directed towards the surface of the organic tissue to be illuminated (<b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>is a partial cross-section of optical element <b>10</b> taken along the line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>and which also illustrates the arrangement of light source <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">For the sake of clarity, a set of Cartesian coordinates x, y, z is defined and added to each Figure to specify the orientation of the various views in space. It will be noted in particular that this set of coordinates is defined such that the general plane of optical element <b>10</b> is parallel to the x-y plane (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), branching <b>11</b> being parallel to the x axis, and that the z axis points from the bottom of the instrument towards the surface of the organic tissue to be illuminated <b>50</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, illumination device <b>1</b> includes in this example a single light source <b>40</b>, preferably a light emitting diode or LED, disposed at centre C of the structure such that its light emission is oriented along the z axis towards the central portion of the optical element as indicated by the arrow. Because of its perpendicular orientation to the plane of optical element <b>10</b>, facets <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>are arranged in a hollow in the lower face <b>10</b><i>a </i>of optical element <b>10</b>. These facets <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>are oriented to redirect, via total internal reflection, the light flux from source <b>40</b> into the various branchings of the optical element. In this embodiment, these facets consequently form a recess <b>15</b> having the general appearance of a tetrahedron or, more exactly, two portions of a tetrahedron. Several facets (two in this example) whose angle decreases with respect to the x-y plane progressively as one moves away from centre C of the structure are preferably used given that the angle of incidence of the beams produced by light source <b>40</b> is generally not constant, the light rays produced by the source typically forming a cone of emission around the z axis. It will be understood that facets <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b> forming recess <b>15</b> can be replaced by any other suitable geometry allowing the light emission from source <b>40</b> to be redirected into the various branchings, for example a curved profile geometry.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the light emission produced by source <b>40</b> is thus redirected into each branching <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> of the optical element, each of these branchings including reflective zones <b>60</b> for redirecting the light flux by total internal reflection into different zones of the surface of organic tissue <b>50</b> as schematised by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, zones <b>60</b> are arranged on the upper face <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the optical element and are formed of at least one facet <b>61</b> inclined in the direction from which the light beam, produced by source <b>40</b>, originates, to form micro-prismatic structures. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, four facets of this type can be seen on branching <b>11</b>. Three of them are distributed over the length of branching <b>11</b> and are each formed by a V-shaped hollow portion arranged on face <b>10</b><i>b</i>. The fourth facet is arranged at the end of branching <b>11</b> and has here a larger area than the other three.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The angle of facets <b>61</b> with respect to the x-y plane, designated &#x3b1;, is determined so as to redirect a part of the incident light beams towards the organic tissue to be illuminated <b>50</b>. The value of this angle &#x3b1; is essentially dictated by the nature of the material used (particularly the refractive index n of the material forming optical guide <b>10</b>), the orientation of the incident beams in the guide as well as the nature of the external medium. As already mentioned, it is possible to envisage coating facets <b>61</b> with a reflective coating (or even the entire upper face <b>10</b><i>b</i>) in order to increase the light flux emerging through lower face <b>10</b><i>a </i>of optical element <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Generally, the design of the optical element has to answer a certain number of geometrical constraints. One of them is the value of the critical angle designated &#x3b8;<sub>c</sub>, defined with respect to the line perpendicular to the face concerned, above which total reflection of the light beams striking the face is produced. This critical angle is commonly given by the following formula:</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">where n<sub>1 </sub>corresponds to the refractive index of the external medium (equal to 1 in the case of air) and n<sub>2 </sub>corresponds to the refractive index of the guide where the light beams are being propagated. In order to ensure that total internal reflection of the beams always occurs inside optical guide <b>10</b>, the relation according to which the light beams inside the guide have to have an angle of incidence with respect to the face concerned that is greater than the aforementioned critical angle &#x3b8;<sub>c </sub>must thus be respected. In the opposite case, a portion of the light beams will then be propagated outside the optical guide by refraction. As already mentioned, if necessary, reflective coatings allow an incident light beam to be totally reflected. This results, however, in losses by absorption, which it is preferably to minimise as far as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>show an alternative embodiment illustrating an alternative for making reflecting zones <b>60</b>. Instead of making these zones <b>60</b> on upper face <b>10</b><i>b </i>of optical element <b>10</b>, it is thus possible to make the zones on the lateral faces of optical element <b>10</b> which are both essentially perpendicular to the surface of the organic tissue to be illuminated and parallel to the general direction of propagation of the light flux in the optical element. This could be for example faces designated <b>10</b><i>c </i>and <b>10</b><i>d </i>of branching <b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>(and the corresponding lateral faces of the two other branchings <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>). In order to exploit these faces, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, facets should be arranged, designated <b>62</b> and inclined both in the direction from which the light beam produced by source <b>40</b> originates and in the direction of the surface of the organic tissue to be illuminated. One and/or the other of faces <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>10</b><i>d </i>can be structured in this way. It should be noted that the light flux emerging through face <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the optical element that is reflected by a facet <b>62</b> will have a general direction with not only a component along the z axis, but also a component along the y axis (or even x). In the example being discussed, given that photoreceptors are arranged on either side of each of branchings <b>11</b> to <b>13</b>, it is preferable to structure the two lateral faces of each branching symmetrically, in order to ensure uniform distribution illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The two structuring methods discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>can advantageously be combined. Moreover, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, the end of each branching includes an inclined facet <b>61</b> like the solution of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>. Further, the size of the facets (depth and/or width) and their number per surface unit can be variable. It is particularly desirable to increase the reflective surface of zones <b>60</b> and/or to increase the number progressively as one moves away from light source <b>40</b> along the propagation path of the light beam, in order to compensate, to a certain extent, for the progressive decrease in the intensity of the light flux.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The structure of optical element <b>10</b> is evidently not limited to the single example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, optical element <b>10</b> can have a wider branched structure forming open (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) or closed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) cells around the position of the various photoreceptors. In order to optimise as far as possible the available surface on the portable instrument, a honeycomb cellular structure appears particularly advantageous because of its optimum use of space. As already mentioned hereinbefore, by adopting such a configuration, it appears in practice to be possible to arrange less than ten quasi-punctual photoreceptors at the heart of a structured cellular optical element on an area of ten or so cm<sup>2 </sup>such as is typically available on the back cover of an instrument worn on the wrist.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the variants of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, it will be noted that reflective zones <b>60</b> of optical element <b>10</b>, which allow reorientation of the light flux in the direction of the organic tissue to be illuminated have been shown like the reflective zones illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>. These diagrams are only schematic and illustrative. In particular, structuring of this type illustrated by way of variant in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>can be used as a replacement or complement. Moreover, the number, shape and arrangement of the reflective zones can vary. Finally, the dimensions of the reflective zones (width and depth) are not necessarily to scale.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows yet another variant, similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, wherein the optical element has a cellular structure in which each cell has a circular or annular shape instead of the polygonal cellular structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. By way of example, reflective zones <b>60</b> are structured like the zones of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>on the lateral faces of guide <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the propagation path of the light beam (again produced at centre C of the structure) into the various branchings of optical element <b>10</b> is also indicated by arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the assembling of the illumination device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in back cover <b>35</b> of portable instrument <b>3</b>. In accordance with the foregoing description, the light emitting diode <b>40</b> is arranged, in this example, in a central area of back cover <b>35</b> and directed such that its light emission is oriented parallel to the z axis in the direction of recess <b>15</b> arranged on the lower face (the face directed upwards in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of optical element <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Spacers (not shown) can be arranged at intervals between optical element <b>10</b> and back cover <b>35</b> so as to arranged a small air space between the walls of guide <b>10</b> and the neighbouring walls of back cover <b>35</b>. An intermediate wall (not shown) could also be inserted between back cover <b>35</b> and guide <b>10</b>, on the one hand, and the surface of the organic tissue to be illuminated on the other hand. In this regard, as already mentioned, back cover <b>35</b> preferably has a peripheral rib <b>70</b>, of annular shape here, which projects outside of the back cover in the direction of the organic tissue to be illuminated. In this configuration, the purpose of this rib <b>70</b> is essentially to answer two objectives. The first of these objectives is to form an optical barrier preventing the ambient lighting to disturb the measurement of the physiological quantity. The second of these objectives is to ensure that the optical guide is not directly in contact with the organic tissue. It is in fact preferable to ensure that a space permanently exists between the optical guide and the illuminated organic tissue so that the nature of the interface between the guide and the external environment remains constant and invariable over time, particularly during relative movements of the portable instrument with respect to the organic tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it will be noted that rib <b>70</b> could advantageously follow the external contour of illumination device <b>1</b>, in which case, this rib <b>70</b> would have a shape with three lobes rather than annular as illustrated. However, ribs could advantageously be inserted between the illumination and detection devices to limit direct light coupling between the devices.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition to the presence of rib <b>70</b>, it is also preferable to arranged the surfaces of back cover <b>35</b>, which are located between the illumination and detection devices (the three hatched annular surfaces in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) such that they do not reflect the light emission produced by the illumination device. Indeed, insofar as a space exists between back cover <b>35</b> and the organic tissue on which it lies, a portion of the light emission could be reflected between the surface of back cover <b>35</b> and the surface of the illuminated organic tissue before being picked up by the detection device. By arranging an anti-reflective coating on the intermediate surfaces of back cover <b>35</b>, between the illumination and detection devices, the disturbing influence of these multiple reflections between the back cover and the organic tissue will be limited.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows yet another variant, which illustrates several modifications that can be envisaged within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">First of all, the embodiments presented hereinbefore only include a single optical element forming a guide coupled to a single light source. It is perfectly possible to envisage using several distinct optical guides each coupled to one or several light sources. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows, for example, a variant including two optical guides <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, of essentially rectilinear shape, each coupled to a light source <b>41</b>, <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Secondly, the arrangement of the light source with respect to the optical guide to which it is coupled can take different configurations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows, for example, that each light source <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> is placed facing one end of the associated optical guide, the light emission being oriented along the x axis in this example. This solution thus does not require an optical device to redirect the light beams in the general plane of the guide as in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thirdly, the detection device can advantageously also be itself provided with one or several optical elements forming a guide to pick up the light emission propagated in different zones of the surface of the organic tissue being examined, each optical element being coupled to at least one photoreceptor. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, this illustrated by the presence of three optical elements <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> forming guides arranged alternately on either side of optical illumination elements <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and each coupled, via one of their ends, to a photoreceptor <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, respectively <b>23</b>. The structuring of these optical elements is essentially similar to that of the optical illumination guides presented hereinbefore.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Fourthly, the geometry of the guide does not necessarily have to follow the arcs of a circle as in the preceding embodiments. The arc of a circle shape is essentially dictated by the quasi-punctual or the photoreceptor(s) used in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>. The essential lies above all in respecting a determined distance, within a given tolerance range, between the zones where the illumination device injects the light beam and the zones where the detection device picks up the light beam after propagation in the organic tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On this last point, it should be noted that the use of one or several optical guides for picking up the light emission after propagation in the organic tissue opens up other configuration possibilities. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it can thus be seen that the use of optical guides for the detection of the light emission enables the illumination and detection devices to be configured in a particularly simple manner, geometrically speaking. Indeed, the various optical guides used <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> have here simply the form of a structured rectilinear bar, that is thus particularly easy to manufacture. Care will be taken in such case to respect a certain spacing A between the optical elements and a certain width L of the optical elements, this spacing A and width L being, however, able to vary from one optical guide to another.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Other variants can of course be envisaged. Thus, one could envisage structuring the optical elements such that they have complementary shapes able to be fitted into each other (for example comb or spiral like structures) while still respecting a distance essentially determined between the light emission emergence zones and the light emission detection zones. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> show, in this regard, similar variants to those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, respectively, where the three photoreceptors <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> are coupled to respective optical guides <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>. Like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the variant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> again shows that the photoreceptors can be coupled to one end of the associated optical elements.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, it will be understood that the various optical guides of a same (illumination or detection) device could be combined in a single same optical guide and that the number of associated light sources or photoreceptors could be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Lastly, it will also be understood that several light sources emitting within distinct wavelength ranges could be simultaneously coupled on the same optical guide. In such case, it would seem wise to provide the illumination device with an optical device to mix the light emission from the various sources at the inlet of the optical element or to couple the various light sources such that their light emissions are mixed in the optical guide, the idea being above all that the light emission emerging from the various zones of the optical guide has proper uniformity and homogeneity between the various components of desired wavelengths. As already mentioned in the preamble, the use of a diffusing medium to make the optical guide would favour such homogeneity, but light intensity losses are to be expected.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Generally, it will have been understood that the use of an optical element forming a guide, such as that proposed hereinbefore, for illuminating the organic tissue and, if necessary, for detecting the light emission after propagation in the tissue, enables the available surface on the portable instrument and use of the available light energy to be optimised as far as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Finally, it will be understood that various other modifications and/or improvements evident to those skilled in the art can be made to the embodiments described in the present description without departing from the scope of the invention defined by the annexed claims. In particular, the present invention is not limited solely to use in a wristwatch, but also applies to any other portable application, whether worn on the wrist or not.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A master station includes a group of circuits for performing an optimization method. In such a system, the optimization is achieved by adjusting the pull-up resistance and by setting the best possible clock frequency to ensure that data/clock high and low voltage levels are within predetermined specifications. An optimization procedure is performed in a calibration phase invoked by a user or a system whenever a change is introduced to the system, such as addition or deletion of slave stations, a change of data/clock lines, or a change that may affect on the electrical and timing characteristics of the two-wire communication system.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese patent application serial no. 2006-159371, filed on Jun. 8, 2006, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a bidirectional communication system and a calibrator. More particularly, the invention relates to a two-wire bidirectional data communication system including a data line for transferring data signals and a clock line for transferring clock signals, in which plural stations having common pull-up resistances are provided, and to a calibrator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The background of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Here <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a two-wire bidirectional data communication system. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a data line <b>12</b> and a clock line <b>13</b> include a pull-up resistance <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> and a pull-up resistance <b>14</b>-<b>2</b> respectively to which a master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and plural slave stations <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>11</b>-N are connected.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> includes a field-effect transistor (FET) <b>24</b>-<b>1</b> for generating data output and an amplifier <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> for performing data input in order to input and output data signals, each of which is connected to a data unit <b>23</b>-<b>1</b> for performing signal processing of transmitted data and received data. Also there are connected a field-effect transistor <b>27</b>-<b>1</b>, an amplifier <b>25</b>-<b>1</b>, and a clock unit <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> in the similar way for clock signals.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The slave stations <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>11</b>-N have the same configuration as the master station.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this system, the data line <b>12</b> of the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and slave stations <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>11</b>-N is connected to the pull-up resistance <b>14</b>-<b>1</b>. Also the clock line <b>13</b> thereof is connected to the pull-up resistance <b>14</b>-<b>2</b>. Further, due to wiring, a parasitic capacitance <b>21</b>-<b>1</b> is generated between an earth potential and the data line <b>12</b>, and a parasitic capacitance <b>21</b>-<b>2</b> is generated between an earth potential and the clock line <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The two-wire bidirectional data communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,740. Incidentally JP-A No. 106262/1982 is the Japanese counterpart of U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,740.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In such a communication system having plural salve stations, the voltage levels of the data signal and clock signal as well as the timing characteristics, such as rise time and fall time, are dependent on the number of stations to be connected. For this reason, the connectable number of stations and the pull-up resistance value have been set in advance in consideration of the leakage current and the parasitic capacitance in each station.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile in a system where the number of stations can be flexibly changed, the number of stations is changed in an application, so that the leakage current and the parasitic capacitance in each station are different from the design values. This has sometimes caused degradation of data signal waveform due to reduction of signal amplitude, increase of rise/fall time and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,643,787 a method for suppressing communication errors caused by the signal degradation as described above. This technology includes a circuit called a data history generator in each slave station to optimize a bandwidth compensation circuit provided in a data receiving section so that each slave station suppresses the error rate of received data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in the technology described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,643,787, complex circuits such as the data history generator and the bandwidth compensation circuit are necessary.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides a two-wire bidirectional communication system and a calibrator that are able to flexibly support the change of the number of stations by optimizing the electrical and timing characteristics of a data signal and clock signal transmitted via a data line and clock line, respectively, between many stations without the need for complex circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To solve the above described problem, the present invention introduces a calibrator for controlling variable pull-up resistances provided in a data line and in a clock line to control the clock signal frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">With respect to an arbitrary number of stations interconnected in the two-wire bidirectional communication system, the calibrator detects the signal levels of the data signal and clock signal by a peak detector and by a bottom detector, and performs optimization so that the pull-up resistance values of the data line and clock line are desired voltage levels. In addition, the calibrator adjusts the clock frequency to provide a maximum communication speed, while detecting that the signal levels of the data signal and clock signal are at the desired voltage levels.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As described above, the present invention achieves optimization of the voltage levels of the data signal and clock signal, the rise time, and the fall time in the two-wire bidirectional communication system. Such optimization can be performed in response to addition or deletion of a station, initialization of the system, or a user request.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a two-wire communication system <b>100</b> includes N stations (<b>11</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>11</b>-N) interconnected by a data line <b>12</b> and by a clock line <b>13</b>, and a calibrator <b>31</b>. The calibrator <b>31</b> is connected to a variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> and a variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>2</b> via control lines <b>34</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>34</b>-<b>2</b>, respectively, within a housing <b>30</b>. The calibrator <b>31</b> is also connected to the data line <b>12</b> and the clock line <b>13</b> to monitor the data signal and the clock signal. Further the calibrator <b>31</b> is connected to a data unit <b>23</b>-<b>1</b> of the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> via a control line <b>32</b>. The calibrator <b>31</b> is also connected to a clock unit <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> of the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> via a control line <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the case of inputting no clock signal, the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> may not include the amplifier <b>25</b>-<b>1</b>. Also in the case of outputting no clock signal, the salve stations <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>11</b>-N may not include field-effect transistors <b>27</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>27</b>-N, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the calibrator includes: a processor <b>41</b>; a pull-up resistance controller <b>42</b> for adjusting the resistance value of the variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b>; an amplifier <b>47</b> for monitoring the data signal; a peak detector <b>43</b> and a bottom detector <b>44</b>; a clock control block <b>46</b> for controlling the clock frequency of the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> by the processor <b>41</b>; and a data control block <b>45</b> for controlling the data. Although the illustration of the clock signal is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the calibrator monitors the clock line <b>13</b> to adjust the variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>2</b> for the clock signal in the similar way to the data signal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the case of the data signal in which Vlow is generated due to a voltage drop of the pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> with any of the field-effect transistors <b>24</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>24</b>-N turned ON (conducting state). On the other hand Vhigh is generated as the current hardly flows through the variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> with all the field-effect transistors <b>24</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>24</b>-N turned OFF (non-conducting state).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">However, when the resistance value of the variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> is too small, it is impossible to obtain a sufficient voltage drop even if any of the field-effect transistors <b>24</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>24</b>-N is turned ON, so that the voltage may not drop below Vol which is a desired low level as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In such a case, the calibrator <b>31</b> detects a low level of the data signal by the bottom detector <b>44</b> and controls the variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> to increase above Vol which is the desired low level through the processor <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> is too large, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, Vhigh which is a high level of the data signal may not reach a desired voltage level Voh. This is because the rise time increases as large as the time constant given by the product of the parasitic capacitance <b>21</b>-<b>1</b> between the variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> and the data line <b>12</b>. In such a case, the calibrator <b>31</b> detects a high level of the data signal by the peak detector <b>43</b>, and controls the variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> to be reduced below Voh which is the desired high level through the processor <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further when the number of ports is large, or when the parasitic capacitance is large because the data line is long or other reason, it is impossible to meet the desired voltage levels Vol and Voh at the same time only by the optimization of the pull-up resistance value as described above. In such a case, the calibrator <b>31</b> reduces the clock frequency through the clock control block <b>46</b> and adjusts to the clock frequency meeting the desired voltage levels. As a result, optimization of the variable pull-up resistance and clock frequency is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, a description will be given of the relationship between the sink current and the pull-up resistance value as well as to the relationship between the parasitic capacitance and the pull-up resistance value in the field-effect transistor. Here <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a diagram illustrating the relationship between the sink current and the pull-up resistance value. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is a diagram illustrating the relationship between the parasitic capacitance and the pull-up resistance value.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the graph shows a curve <b>85</b> giving Vlow=Vol, where the ordinate is the pull-up resistance value and the abscissa is the sink current. It is shown that Vlow is smaller than Vol in an area above the curve <b>85</b>, so that it is necessary to set the pull-up resistance value on or above the curve <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the graph shows curves <b>81</b> to <b>84</b> giving Vhigh=Voh, where the ordinate is the pull-up resistance value and the abscissa is the parasitic capacitance, with clock frequencies as parameters. Here fmin is the frequency of the curve <b>81</b>, f<b>2</b> is the frequency of the curve <b>82</b>, f<b>3</b> is the frequency of the curve <b>83</b>, and f<b>4</b> is the frequency of the curve <b>84</b>. The frequencies have a relationship of fmin&#x3c;f<b>2</b>&#x3c;f<b>3</b>&#x3c;f<b>4</b>. It is shown that Vhigh is larger than Voh in an area above the curves <b>81</b> to <b>84</b>, so that it is necessary to set the pull-up resistance value on or above the curves <b>81</b> to <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With Is<b>0</b> for the sink current of the field-effect transistor and Cw<b>0</b> for the parasitic capacitance of the wiring, the upper limit of the pull-up resistance value is given by R<b>1</b> from the intersection between Cw<b>0</b> and the curve <b>81</b> of the frequency fmin as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. The lower limit of the pull-up resistance value is given by R<b>2</b> from the intersection between Is<b>0</b> and the curve <b>85</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Here R<b>2</b> is the optimal value of the pull-up resistance giving the applicable maximum frequency f<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Incidentally, the characteristics of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>7</b>B are dependent on the characteristics of the station, the wire length or other factors. When the effective capacitance of the wiring is changed in the event of an update of salve station, the optimal point is different from that estimated before the change. The calibrator <b>31</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has sufficient intelligence and functionality for calculating the optimal setting of the pull-up resistance value and clock frequency, covering all and any sink currents and effective capacitances.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Now returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the two-wire bidirectional communication system <b>100</b> can operate in two modes. The first mode is a calibration mode that the block calibrator <b>31</b> estimates the optimal values of the pull-up resistance value and clock frequency. The second mode is a normal operation mode for performing communication between the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and the slave stations <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>11</b>-N by the use of parameters set during the calibration mode with the calibrator kept in an inactive state.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the calibration mode is invoked, the calibrator <b>31</b> controls the data unit <b>23</b>-<b>1</b> and clock unit <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> of the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> to perform a calibration procedure. The calibration mode can be roughly divided into two phases. A calibration phase <b>1</b> optimizes the electrical characteristic of Vlow. An object of this phase is to estimate an appropriate pull-up resistance Rp_opt so as to satisfy the required condition Vlow=Vol. The Vlow parameter is strongly dependent on the sink current of the slave stations. Thus the phase <b>1</b> of the calibration mode is needed to be performed for each of the slave stations in order to estimate the optimal setting that can be received by all the slave stations within the system.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The system is not calibrated yet and the phase <b>1</b> needs to treat each slave station separately. It is necessary to confirm that the treated slave station can interpret the calibration request and can respond as intended. In order to overcome this difficulty, the initial setting of the pull-up resistance is selected to the maximum value the system supports. The restriction to the maximum value of the pull-up resistance Rp is the operation clock frequency that can be set to the minimum frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The concept of the calibration method will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. It is assumed that the pull-up resistance value of the calibration initial setting is Rp_max and the clock frequency thereof is f_min. This is to allow the master station to perform communication with the slave stations for the first time under the widest range of communication conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The calibration phase <b>1</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the ordinate is Vlow and the abscissa is the pull-up resistance value. The pull-up resistance controller <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> sets the resistance value of the variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> to Rp_max. The clock control block <b>46</b> controls the clock unit <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> of the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> to supply a clock of the clock frequency f_min to the slave station. The data control block <b>45</b> controls the data unit <b>23</b>-<b>1</b> of the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> to instruct the station <b>11</b>-M (M: <b>1</b> to N) to send a calibration signal. The station <b>11</b>-M sends a series of alternating logic high and logic low. During the signal transmission, the bottom detector <b>44</b> of the calibrator <b>31</b> monitors the data line <b>12</b> and determines Vlow<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The resistance value of the variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> is reduced to obtain Vlow<b>2</b>. Then Rp_opt satisfying the required condition Vlow=Vol is obtained using a step by step method, binary search, or a linear approximation method.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In order to ensure that the setting of Rp_opt can be received by all the stations existing on a bus, the calibration phase <b>1</b> repeats the procedure for all the slave stations. A more appropriate method is to selectively perform the calibration phase <b>1</b> only for the slave station that has never been calibrated before.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next a calibration phase <b>2</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. It is assumed that Rp opt was obtained in the calibration phase <b>1</b> to serve as the resistance value of the variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> that can be communicated with all the slave stations. The pull-up resistance controller <b>42</b> sets the resistance value of the variable pull-up resistance <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> to Rp_opt. In the calibration phase <b>2</b>, none of the slave stations <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>11</b>-N responds during this phase, keeping their transistors in OFF state. The initial clock frequency setting is f_min in the calibration phase <b>2</b>. During this phase, the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> sends a series of alternating logic high and logic low. During the signal transmission, the peak detector <b>43</b> determines Vhigh<b>1</b> by monitoring the data line.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The clock frequency is increased and is converged to an optimal point on a curve L<b>12</b> satisfying the required condition Vhigh=Voh by several repeat methods. The optimal clock frequency f_opt can be calculated from the optimal point. The curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> can be approximated to Vhigh=A&#xb7;(1&#x2212;exp(&#x2212;B/f)) due to the nature of the capacitance charge of Vhigh. Here A and B are the constants, f and Vhigh are the x coordinate and y coordinate indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. It is possible to design a faster convergence method by taking into consideration the above equation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The change of the clock frequency setting obtained in the phase <b>2</b> is achieved using the clock control block <b>46</b> connected to the clock unit <b>26</b>-<b>1</b> of the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b>. The processor <b>41</b> uses the data control block <b>45</b> to operate the data unit <b>23</b>-<b>1</b> of the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> during the calibration procedure. Once the two phases of the calibration have been successfully completed, the system can be operated within the required electrical specifications Voh and Vol at the fastest possible clock frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next calibration protocols for each of the calibration phases will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>. Here <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows calibration protocols for the calibration phase <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows calibration protocols for the calibration phase <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, a data signal <b>50</b> is shown in an upper part and a clock signal <b>60</b> is shown in a lower part. The clock signal <b>60</b> is sent by the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b>. The data signal <b>50</b> is sent by the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and by the station <b>11</b>-M accordingly, so that each corresponding source is described in a source column.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When entering the calibration phase <b>1</b>, the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> sends START condition <b>51</b> and STATION ADDRESS <b>52</b>. At this time the frequency of the clock signal is fmin. The station <b>11</b>-M corresponding to STATION ADDRESS <b>52</b> sends ACK <b>53</b>. The master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> receives ACK <b>53</b> and sends CAL MODE CONTROL BYTE <b>1</b> <b>54</b>. The station <b>11</b>-M receives CAL MODE CONTROL BYTE <b>1</b> <b>54</b> and sends an alternating bit sequence of 10101010 <b>55</b>. It is to be noted that the station <b>11</b>-M includes the master station. During the signal transmission, the calibrator <b>31</b> measurers Vlow. The master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> sends ACK <b>56</b> and STOP <b>57</b> to continue the measurement with the pull-up resistance changed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, a data signal <b>70</b> is shown in an upper part and a clock signal <b>90</b> is shown in a lower part. The clock signal <b>90</b> is sent by the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b>. The data signal <b>70</b> is sent by the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and by the slave stations <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>11</b>-N accordingly, so that each corresponding source is described in a source column.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When entering the calibration phase <b>2</b>, the master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> sends START condition <b>71</b> and GENERAL CALL ADDRESS <b>72</b>. At this time the frequency of the clock signal is fmin. The slave stations <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>11</b>-N send ACK <b>73</b>. The master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> receives ACK <b>73</b> and sends CAL MODE CONTROL BYTE <b>2</b> <b>74</b>. The slave stations <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>11</b>-N receive CAL MODE CONTROL BYTE <b>2</b> <b>74</b> but do not respond thereto. The master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> sends an alternating bit sequence of 10101010 <b>75</b>. During the signal transmission, the calibrator <b>31</b> measures Vhigh. The master station <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> sends ACK <b>76</b> and STOP <b>77</b> to continue the measurement with the clock frequency changed. Incidentally, in the second and subsequent operations, the clock frequency is increased after the transmission of 10101010 <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11D</figref>, a description will be given of the operation that the two-wire bidirectional communication system <b>100</b>, which is operating in the normal operation mode, passes through the calibration mode and then returns to the normal operation mode.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, it is assumed that an event X occurs during the operation performed in the normal operation mode (S<b>101</b>). The event X includes a reset, introduction of a new slave station, a change of the wire length, or a calibration request of a user. The calibration phase <b>1</b> is started after S<b>101</b> (S<b>102</b>). The calibrator <b>31</b> sets the pull-up resistance value to Rp_max and the clock frequency to f_min (S<b>103</b>). Then the calibrator <b>31</b> resets the bottom detector <b>44</b> (S<b>104</b>). During the calibration mode, the calibrator <b>31</b> controls the master station. The master station generates and sends START condition to start the calibration phase <b>1</b> (S<b>105</b>). Following this the master station sends the station address of a station involved in the calibration (S<b>106</b>), and waits for receiving ACK (S<b>107</b>). When there is no ACK received from the slave station within a predetermined time period in S<b>107</b> (NO), this is because the slave station cannot interpret the signal. In this case, the calibrator may need to redefine Rp_max and fmin, confirming the availability of communication with the slave station by reducing f_min or by increasing Rp_max. Thus the process returns to S<b>103</b> through S<b>108</b>. On the other hand, when receiving ACK from the slave station in S<b>107</b> (YES), the master station sends a command (CAL CONTROL BYTE <b>1</b>) for the calibration phase <b>1</b> to instruct the corresponding station that the calibrator attempts to perform the calibration phase <b>1</b> (S<b>109</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the station starts sending 10101010 in response to the received command for the calibration phase <b>1</b> (S<b>111</b>). The calibrator measures Vlow (S<b>112</b>). When the measured Vlow is larger than Vol, the calibrator increases Rp in S<b>113</b>, and when the measured Vlow is smaller than Vol, the calibrator reduces Rp in S<b>114</b>. Then the calibrator measures Vlow again (S<b>112</b>). Upon completion of the measurement in S<b>112</b>, the master station generates and sends an ACK command, and then generates and sends a STOP command (S<b>115</b>). Next it is determined whether Vlow is equal to Vol within a predetermined error range (S<b>116</b>), and if it is not equal, the process returns to S<b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When it is equal in S<b>116</b>, the calibrator stores Rp_opt (n) (S<b>117</b>). The calibrator determines whether all the stations are calibrated (S<b>118</b>). If not all the stations are calibrated (NO), the calibrator selects the next station (S<b>119</b>). Then the process returns to S<b>103</b>. When YES in S<b>119</b>, the calibrator sets Rp_opt of all the calibrated n slave stations to the maximum Rp_opt (n) (S<b>120</b>). Then the process moves to S<b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, when the calibration phase <b>2</b> is started (S<b>131</b>), the variable calibrator first sets the resistance value of the pull-up resistance (Rp) to Rp_opt and the clock frequency (fclk) to f_min (S<b>132</b>). The calibrator resets the peak detector (S<b>133</b>), and generates and sends START condition to start the calibration phase <b>2</b> (S<b>134</b>). Under the control of the calibrator, the master station sends GENERAL CALL ADDRESS (S<b>135</b>) to determine whether to receive ACK from all the slave stations (S<b>136</b>). If it is failed to receive ACK from all the slave stations within a predetermine time period in S<b>136</b> (NO), the calibrator reduces f_min (S<b>137</b>). Then the process returns to S<b>132</b>. When YES in S<b>136</b>, the master station sends a command (CAL MODE CONTROL BYTE <b>2</b>) for the calibration phase <b>2</b> (S<b>138</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>, all the slave stations turn their field-effect transistors to OFF state in response to the received command for the calibration phase <b>2</b>. The master station starts sending 10101010 (S<b>141</b>), and then the calibrator measures Vhigh. The calibrator increases fclk if Vhigh&#x3e;Voh(S<b>143</b>), while reducing fclk if Vhigh&#x3c;Voh (S<b>144</b>). Then the calibrator measures Vhigh again (S<b>142</b>). When the measurement is completed in S<b>142</b>, the master station generates and sends an ACK command, then generates and sends a STOP command (S<b>145</b>). Next it is determined whether Vhigh is equal to Voh within a predetermined error range (S<b>146</b>), and if it is not equal (NO), the process returns to S<b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When it is equal in S<b>146</b>, the calibrator sets f_opt and Rp_opt as system parameters (S<b>147</b>). In this way the calibration mode is completed (S<b>148</b>), and the system operates in the normal operation mode.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After completion of the calibration mode, the calibrator stops to control the master station and the system returns to the normal operation mode. The foregoing discussion of the calibration method has mainly focused on the data signal. The calibration of the clock line is not necessary for a system on which a single master is mounted where the clock output from the master station is a push-pull type. In a system with plural master stations mounted thereon, the clock output is an open drain output, and the electrical characteristic of the clock signal can be optimized by adopting the concept of the calibration method similar to that proposed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. Incidentally, of the clock frequencies obtained from the data line calibration and the clock line calibration, the slower is finally selected for the clock frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The above description of the calibration procedure uses specific terms in order to better understand how the calibration mode can be performed by slightly changing the existing two-wire communication protocols. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that specific details are not necessary and that any other protocols can be used. Having described the invention with reference to certain preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will understand that changes can be made within the scope of the preferred embodiments. It is to be understood that the mode and details can be modified in various ways without departing from the sprit and scope of the preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to the present invention, it is possible to obtain a two-wire bidirectional communication system and a calibrator that are able to provide the fastest communication speed between a master station and slave stations.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to modeling environments, and more particularly to methods and systems for analyzing the linearization of models in the modeling environments.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various classes of block diagrams describe computations that can be performed on application specific computational hardware, such as a computer, microcontroller, FPGA, and custom hardware. Classes of such block diagrams include time-based block diagrams such as those found within Simulink&#xae; from the MathWorks, Inc. Natick Mass., state-based and flow diagrams such as those found within Stateflow&#xae; from the MathWorks, Inc. Natick Mass., and data-flow diagrams. A common characteristic among these various forms of block diagrams is that they define semantics on how to execute the diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The process of linearization is the approximation of complex models (i.e., non-linear models) that yields a sufficiently simple linear model for engineering analysis tools. Linearization is a well-known commonly used analysis tool that has been documented in many control textbooks. A fundamental principle of linearization analysis is that the approximation of a complex model is accurate for regions near a baseline, equilibrium, or operating condition.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional block diagram modeling environments provide tools for linearizing block diagram models. For example, Simulink&#xae; Control Design provides extensive tools for linearizing Simulink&#xae; model. The difficulty in linearizing a model in a block diagram modeling environment is that each element in a model contributes to the overall linearization. Typically many industrial models can be described by greater then 1000 blocks making the process of understanding how each block contributes to a linearization is difficult. Although the conventional block modeling environments provide tools for linearizing block diagram models, the conventional block diagram modeling environments do not allow users to properly analyze the linearization results of the block diagram models. Therefore it is desired to provide tools for the users to properly analyze the linearization results of models so that the users are able to explore in detail how each of linearization factors contributes to the linearization of the models.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides methods and systems for analyzing and diagnosing difficulties in the linearization of a model in a modeling environment. The modeling environment may provide tools for linearizing the model to generate a linear model. The modeling environment may also provide tools for analyzing the linearization of the model. The tools for analyzing the linearization of the model may analyze the linear model to determine whether the model is properly linearized. For example, the linear model may be analyzed to determine whether the some components of a model are linearized at a region near discontinuity or singularity. The linear model may also be analyzed to determine whether some components of a model are linearized to have an extremely low or high slope. Information on the linearization of the model may be provided to users so that the users are able to modify the information on the linearization of the model and have the model linearized again using the modified information. Additionally, the tools may report or provide search tools for additional diagnostic information to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a method is provided for analyzing a model in a modeling environment. The model is linearized to generate a linear model. The linear model is analyzed to provide users with information on the linear model.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with certain aspects of the present invention, a method is provided for analyzing a model in a modeling environment. A user interface is provided for displaying elements of the model. On users' selection of one of the elements, information associated with the linearization of the selected element is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with other aspects of the present invention, a system is provided for analyzing a model in a modeling environment. The system includes a linearization tool for linearizing the model to generate a linear model. The system also includes an analysis tool for analyzing the linear model to provide users with information on the linear model.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with other aspects of the present invention, a computer program product is provided for holding computer executable instructions for analyzing a model in a modeling environment. The model is linearized to generate a linear model. The linear model is analyzed to provide users with information on the linear model.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with other aspects of the present invention, a computer program product is provided for holding computer executable instructions for analyzing a model in a modeling environment.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An illustrative embodiment of the present invention relates to the linearization of a model in a modeling environment. The linearization of a model is the approximation of a non-linear system as a linear system in the model, based on the assumption that the system is almost linear within a certain rage of operation. With the linearization of the model, users are able to analyze the dynamic behaviors of the model, for example, determine the stability of a nonlinear model around an operating point. Most frequently engineers use linear models to design control systems using well known control design methodologies. Linear models are typically expressed as a transfer function, a state space representation, or a zero-pole-gain representation, and determine the response of the model to arbitrary input signals.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In particular, the illustrative embodiment of the present invention provides users with information on the linearization results of the model so that the users are able to explore how each of linearization factors contributes to the linearization of the model. These contributing factors include:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">

    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0022">1. The type of blocks in the model and their configurations;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0023">2. The behavior of each of the blocks in the model when they are linearized;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0024">3. How the blocks are interconnected; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0025">4. The values of each of the individual block inputs, outputs, and states determine the linear representation of each block.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">Based on the linearization results gathered by this tool, the users are able to change the information on the linearization results of the model. For example, if the users do not like the linearization results of a selected element in the model, the users can specify values for the linearization of the selected element and have the model linearized again using the specified values.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">The illustrative embodiment will be described solely for illustrative purposes relative to a block diagram modeling environment. As described in the Background of the Invention, the block diagram modeling environment may include a time-based block diagram modeling environment, a state-based and flow diagram modeling environment and data flow modeling environment. Although the illustrative embodiment will be described relative to the block diagram modeling environment, one of skill in the art will appreciate that the present invention may apply to other modeling environments including textual modeling environments, such as command line modeling environments.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exemplary electronic device <b>100</b> suitable for practicing the illustrative embodiment of the present invention, which provides a block diagram modeling environment. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the electronic device <b>100</b> is intended to be illustrative and not limiting of the present invention. The electronic device <b>100</b> may take many forms, including but not limited to a workstation, server, network computer, Internet appliance, mobile device, a pager, a tablet computer, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">The electronic device <b>100</b> may include a Central Processing Unit (CPU) <b>110</b>, a memory device <b>120</b>, a storage medium <b>130</b>, an input control <b>140</b>, a network interface <b>160</b>, a MODEM <b>150</b>, a display <b>170</b>, etc. The input control <b>140</b> may interface with a keyboard <b>180</b>, a mouse <b>190</b>, and other input devices. The electronic device <b>100</b> may receive through the input control <b>140</b> input data necessary for creating models in the block diagram modeling environment, such as the selection of the attributes and operations of component blocks in the models. The electronic device <b>100</b> may display in the display <b>170</b> the models generated in the block diagram modeling environment. The network interface <b>160</b> and the MODEM <b>150</b> enable the electronic device <b>100</b> to communicate with other electronic devices through communication networks, such as Internet, intranet, LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network) and MAN (Metropolitan Area Network). The communication facilities may support for the distributed implementations of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">The CPU <b>110</b> controls each component of the electronic device <b>100</b> to provide the block diagram modeling environment. The memory <b>120</b> fetches from the storage <b>130</b> and provides to the CPU <b>110</b> code that needs to be accessed by the CPU <b>110</b> to operate the electronic device <b>100</b> and to run the block diagram modeling environment. The storage <b>130</b> usually contains software tools for applications. The storage <b>130</b> includes, in particular, code <b>131</b> for the operating system (OS) of the device <b>100</b>, code <b>132</b> for applications running on the operation system, such as applications for providing the block diagram modeling environment, and data <b>133</b> used or generated in the device <b>100</b>, such as the data for block diagram models generated in the block diagram modeling environment.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">An exemplary block diagram modeling environment may be found in Simulink&#xae; from The MathWorks, Inc. Simulink&#xae; provides tools for modeling and simulating a variety of dynamic systems in one integrated, graphical environment. Simulink&#xae; enables users to design a block diagram for a target system, simulate the system's behavior, analyze the performance of the system, and refine the design of the system. Simulink&#xae; allows users to design target systems through a user interface that allows drafting of block diagram models of the target systems. All of the blocks in a block library provided by Simulink and other programs are available to users when the users are building the block diagram of the target systems. Individual users may be able to customize this model block to: (a) reorganize blocks in some custom format, (b) delete blocks they do not use, and (c) add custom blocks they have designed. The blocks may be dragged through some human-machine interface (such as a mouse or keyboard) from the block library on to the window (i.e., model canvas). Simulink&#xae; includes a block diagram editor that allows users to perform such actions as draw, edit, annotate, save, and print out block diagram representations of target systems. The block diagram editor is a graphical user interface (GUI) component that allows drafting of block diagram models by users. In Simulink&#xae;, there is also a textual interface with a set of commands that allow interaction with the graphical editor, such as the textual interface provided in MATLAB&#xae;. Using this textual interface, users may write special scripts that perform automatic editing operations on the block diagram. Simulink&#xae; also allows users to simulate the designed target systems to determine the behavior of the systems. Simulink&#xae; includes a block diagram execution engine that carries out the task of compiling and linking the block diagram to produce an &#x201c;in-memory executable&#x201d; version of the model that is used for generating code and/or simulating a block diagram model.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exemplary block diagram modeling environment <b>200</b>, such as Simulink&#xae;. The block diagram modeling environment <b>200</b> may include a linearization tool <b>210</b> for linearizing models, and an analysis tool <b>220</b> for analyzing the linearization of the models. Although the linearization tool <b>210</b> and the analysis tool <b>220</b> are depicted as being incorporated into the block diagram modeling environment <b>200</b> in the illustrative embodiment, one of skill in the art will appreciate that at least one of the linearization tool <b>210</b> and the analysis tool <b>220</b> may be provided separately from the block diagram modeling environment <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">The analysis tool <b>220</b> provides users with information on the linearization results of the model so that the users are able to explore how each of the linearization factors contributes to the linearization results. The analysis tool <b>220</b> may determine whether the model is linearized in a proper manner. If it is determined that the model is linearized in an improper manner, the analysis tool <b>220</b> provides the users with information about the impropriety. The tool <b>220</b> may enable the users to change the information provided on the linearization results of the model, and have the model linearized again using the changed information. The linearization tool <b>210</b> and the analysis tool <b>220</b> will be described below in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart showing an exemplary operation for linearizing a model and analyzing the linearization of the model in the block diagram modeling environment <b>200</b>. First, users may create a model using an editing tool in the modeling environment <b>200</b> (step <b>310</b>). The editing tool may provide graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that enable the users to build the model in the block modeling environment <b>200</b>. Methods are called by the block diagram modeling environment in order to render the block appropriately in the GUI of its parent block diagram. For instance, this set of methods may include a BlockDrawIcon method that determines the shape the block icon has on the GUI. The block diagram modeling environment may allow users to specify the parameters for the block when they use it in the model. The users generally interact with a set of windows that act as canvases for the model. There is generally more than one window for a model because models may be partitioned into multiple hierarchical levels through the use of subsystems. The building of the block diagram model will be described below in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exemplary block diagram model <b>400</b> generated in the block diagram modeling environment <b>200</b>. The model <b>400</b> shows that the Desired Speed <b>410</b> and the Actual Speed <b>460</b> are compared to arrive at the Speed Error <b>420</b>. The Speed Error <b>420</b> is then an input to the Cruise Control System <b>430</b>, which has the ability to adjust the speed. The Cruise Control System <b>430</b> is in communication with the Accelerator Position Command <b>440</b> to set the position of the accelerator pedal, thus adjusting the speed of the automobile <b>450</b>. The automobile <b>450</b> then provides output feedback, through the speedometer, in the form of the Actual Speed <b>460</b> for comparison, again, with the Desired Speed <b>410</b>. The goal of the system is to control the speed of a car driving down the road at a user defined Desired Speed <b>410</b>. An Actual Speed <b>460</b> signal is called the feedback signal, and is used to compute a Speed Error <b>420</b>, which is the difference between the Desired Speed <b>410</b> and the Actual Speed <b>460</b>. The Cruise Control System <b>430</b> is designed to respond to the Speed Error <b>420</b> and compute an Accelerator Position Command <b>440</b> to change the speed of the Automobile <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">The design of the Cruise Control System <b>430</b> requires that the behavior of the Automobile <b>450</b> is known. For the Cruise Control System <b>430</b>, it must be understood how the position of the accelerator pedal affects the speed of the Automobile <b>450</b> over time. Having an accurate understanding of the behavior of the Automobile <b>450</b> allows for a high performance Cruise Control System <b>430</b> to be designed. This behavior is typically captured in a physical model. In many cases, accurate models of physical systems require very complex descriptions. Unfortunately, the design tools for control systems can only be applied to simpler models. A standard approach for control system design is to develop a physical model using complicated descriptions and implement it in a block diagram programming tool. The model is then analyzed using approximation techniques to reduce the model to a simple form for analysis. The approach most widely used approximation technique is the process of linearization.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">Before linearizing the model <b>400</b>, the model <b>400</b> is configured for linearization (step <b>320</b>). The configuration may include the selection of input and output linearization points. For example, the input and output linearization points may be indicated with graphical icons <b>470</b> and <b>480</b> within the model <b>400</b>. The linearization input point <b>470</b> defines an input to the linear model while a linearization output point <b>480</b> defines an output of the linear model. The region between the input and output linearization points <b>470</b> and <b>480</b> defines the portion of the model <b>400</b> that is to be linearized. Users can linearize the whole model <b>400</b> or any blocks or subsystems within the model <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">Due to the presence of a feedback loop in the model <b>400</b>, the input and output linearization points <b>470</b> and <b>480</b> may not completely define the portion of the model that is to be linearized. In this case, to remove the effect of signals feeding back into the portion of the model <b>400</b> that is to be linearized, users may choose to insert an open loop point <b>490</b>, which represents the feedback loop opening. The selection of the feedback loop opening leads to the linearization of the Automobile <b>450</b> only without the effect of the feedback loop.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">After configuring the model <b>400</b> for linearization, one or more operating points are specified about which to linearize the model <b>400</b> (step <b>330</b>). The operating points of the model <b>400</b> define its total &#x201c;state&#x201d; at any given time. For example, for the model of a car engine, the operating points are typically described by variables such as engine speed, throttle angle, engine temperature, and the surrounding atmospheric condition. The behavior or what it typically known as the &#x201c;dynamics&#x201d; of the model are generally affected by the values of the operating points. For example in a car, the behavior of an engine can greatly vary if the car is being operated in the high elevations or the low elevations. In this case the elevation is part of an operating point for the car engine. A linear model is an approximation that is valid in a small region around the operation point of the system. Near the operating point the approximation will be good, while far away it will be poor. A linear model of a car being operated at 3000 ft. will be very accurate at elevations close to 3000 ft. but less accurate as the car travels higher or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an operating point with an exemplary non-linear function, y=x<sup>2</sup>. If the linear approximation is picked to be at x=0.3, the original function has an approximation, y&#x2248;0.09+0.6(x&#x2212;0.3). This approximation is the equation of a straight line. The original function is intersected by the linear approximation at x=0.3. In the region about x=0.3, the approximation is very accurate, but once x moves far away from x=0.3, the approximation becomes very poor. In general, for the linearization of a complex physical system, the approximation is accurate near the selected operating point. Therefore the specification of the operating point directly determines the answer given by linearization.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">In Simulink&#xae; and Simulink Control Design the linearization tool <b>210</b> performs the linearization of a model based on an operating point that a user specifies. They can either specify an operating point by:

The time-based linearization creates a linear model when the simulation clock reaches the time specified by the linearization time parameter. The trigger-based linearization generates a linear model when triggered. When triggered, the tool <b>210</b> generates a linear model at the current operating point. The linear model is stored in the base workspace or in a graphical user interface as a data structure, along with information about the operating point at which the linearization is performed.</li>

<p id="p-0039" num="0045">With the information specified above, such as the linearization input and output points and the operating points, the model <b>400</b> is linearized to generate a linear model using the linearization tool <b>210</b> (step <b>340</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The process of linearization is the approximation of complex models (i.e., non-linear models) that yields a sufficiently simple linear model for engineering analysis tools. A fundamental principle of linearization analysis is that the approximation of a complex model is accurate for regions near a baseline, equilibrium, or operating condition.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0070">After linearizing the model <b>400</b>, the analysis tool <b>220</b> analyzes the linearization results of the model <b>400</b> and provides users with information on the linearization results of the model <b>400</b> (step <b>350</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an exemplary user interface <b>600</b> for providing information on the linearization of the model. In the user interface <b>600</b>, the block diagram model <b>400</b> may be displayed in a hierarchical fashion. For example, the user interface <b>600</b> may include a pane <b>610</b> for displaying subsystems of the model <b>400</b> and an additional pane <b>620</b> for displaying blocks in each of the subsystems displayed in the pane <b>610</b>. This allows the users to browse through the model's hierarchy to find a specific block. The user interface <b>600</b> includes a pane <b>630</b> for displaying information on the linearization of a block selected in the pane <b>620</b>. The information displayed in the pane <b>630</b> includes the values of state space matrices A, B, C and D <b>631</b> that represent the linearization of the selected block. The user may also display the linearization of each specific block in the transfer function or zero-pole-gain format. The information displayed in the pane <b>630</b> also includes the sample times <b>633</b> used in the linearization of the selected block. The information displayed in the pane <b>630</b> further includes information on whether the selected block's linearization effects the linearization of the model <b>400</b>. In the illustrative embodiment, blocks are determined to contribute to the linearization of the model if the blocks are on the path between the input and output linearization points. If blocks are outside the path between the input and output linearization points, the blocks are determined not to contribute to the linearization of the model.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0071">The user interface <b>600</b> may provide users with an option <b>640</b> that allows users to plot the response of the selected block or subsystem using the linearization of the model. The response may be plotted in any of the standard plots for linear time invariant systems, such as a step response plot, an impulse response plot, an initial condition plot, a Bode plot, a Nyquist plot, a Nichols plot, a Zero-Pole plot, and arbitrary simulations. The user interface <b>600</b> may also provide users with an option <b>650</b> that highlights the selected block in the model <b>400</b>. The user interface <b>600</b> may further provide users with an option <b>660</b> for selecting an operating point. If the users have computed the linearization at multiple operating points, the users are able to select and inspect the linearization associated with one of the operating points.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0072">The analysis tool <b>220</b> may further analyze the linear model to determine whether the model <b>400</b> is linearized in improper conditions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are a flow chart showing an exemplary operation of the analysis tool <b>220</b> in the illustrative embodiment. For example, the linear model is analyzed to determine whether the model <b>400</b> is linearized at a region near singularity (step <b>710</b>). In general, a singularity is a point at which an equation, surface, etc., blows up or becomes degenerate. Singularities are often also called singular points. For example, a block representing the function y=1/u has a singularity at u=0. If this function block is linearized at a region near x=0, the analysis tool <b>220</b> displays on the user interface <b>600</b> some information indicating that the function block is linearized near a singularity (step <b>720</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0073">The linear model is also analyzed to determine whether the model <b>400</b> is linearized at a region near discontinuity (step <b>730</b>). The discontinuity is a point at which a mathematical object is discontinuous. In particular, the discontinuity may include discontinuity points in the linearized mathematical object, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> depicts the linearization of the mathematical function depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. If the function is linearized at a region less than x<b>0</b>, the function is linearized to have a slope of D<b>0</b>, and if the function is linearized at a region greater than x<b>0</b>, the function is linearized to have a slope of D<b>1</b>. D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> are discontinuous at x<b>0</b>. The discontinuity may be determined using numerical perturbation in which the small perturbation to the input signal is introduced and the corresponding perturbation to the output signal is measured. If the slopes measured in perturbation include a large difference of values, the point is determined as the discontinuity. If the function is linearized at a region near x<b>0</b>, the analysis tool <b>220</b> displays on the user interface <b>600</b> some information indicating that the selected block is linearized near a discontinuity (step <b>740</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0074">The linear model is further analyzed to determine whether the model <b>400</b> is linearized to have an extremely low or high slope, for example, about zero or infinite slope (step <b>750</b>). The extremely low or high slope may indicate that the model <b>400</b> is linearized improperly. If the linear model has an extremely low or high slope, the analysis tool <b>220</b> displays on the user interface <b>600</b> some diagnostic information indicating that the selected block is linearized improperly (step <b>760</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0075">In addition to the above examples of problematic linearization other situations that can be reported include:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0076">Blocks that are known to be difficult to linearize (step <b>770</b>). This can be due to the numerical limits of linearization or due to the nature of some of the blocks in the model. The linearization tools will provide suggestions for suitable replacements or modeling changes for linearizations (step <b>771</b>).</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0077">Blocks in a model which extra care must be provided (step <b>781</b>) when considering a multi-rate linearization (step <b>780</b>). For example the discretization of transport delays is known to be particularly difficult. The tool would then give users suggestions on the best way to handle the discretization of these blocks.</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0078">User defined diagnostics (step <b>790</b>) to check for specific conditions of a linearization of a specific block or subsystem type (step <b>791</b>).</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0079">In addition to diagnostic information, the user may query (step <b>792</b>) for specific condition of a linearization of a specific block type or subsystem type (step <b>793</b>).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0080">The conditions include searching (or querying) for:
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">

    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0081">Specific block linearizations. An example of this would be searching for blocks that have elements in their D-matrix which are greater then a quantity.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0082">Specific block operating conditions. For example a user may search for all saturation blocks that have an input that is in the region of saturation.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0083">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, users may inspect all the information provided on the user interface <b>600</b> on the linearization of the selected model. Based on the information provided on the user interface <b>600</b>, the users determine whether the linearization is performed properly (step <b>360</b>). If the users determine that the linearization of the model <b>400</b> is not proper, the users may modify the linearization results of the selected block (step <b>370</b>) and have the linearization tool <b>210</b> recompute the linearization of the model <b>400</b> using the modified information. In addition to modifying the linearization, the user interface may report to the user suitable modifications that can be made to the model or operating point to improve the results of a linearization.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0084">Users may change the individual linearization results including the state space matrices A, B, C, and D <b>631</b> of a selected block, or the users may enter a new transfer function for the selected block. The users can also choose to change the sample rate <b>633</b> of the selected block using discretization methods such as zero order hold discretization. The users can also change the representation of time delay blocks if the model <b>400</b> includes time delay blocks. The representation of the time delay blocks can vary from an exact continuous representation, a Pad&#xe9; approximation, or an approximate discrete representation. The users may select one of other representations of the time delay blocks if the users determine that the linearization of the current representation of the time delay blocks is not accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0085">As described above, the linearization tool <b>210</b> allows the linearization of a subsystem inside the block diagram model <b>400</b>. The users are also able to replace the components of the subsystem with the linear subsystem in the model. This allows the users to reduce the complexity (fidelity) of the model with a linear component.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0086">Numerous modifications and alternative embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing description. Accordingly, this description is to be construed as illustrative only and is for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the best mode for carrying out the present invention. Details of the structure and method may vary substantially without departing from the spirit of the invention, and exclusive use of all modifications that come within the scope of the appended claims is reserved.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to data processing by digital computer, and more particularly to workload balancing in environments with multiple clusters of application servers.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, clustering is the use of multiple computers, multiple storage devices, and redundant interconnections, to form what appears to users as a single highly available system. Cluster computing can be used for load balancing as well as for high availability. Load balancing is dividing the amount of work that a computer has to do between two or more computers so that more work gets done in the same amount of time and, in general, all users get served faster. Load balancing can be implemented with hardware, software, or a combination of both.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Traditional workload balancing methods in clustered application server environments focus on distribution of load within a single cluster to a static amount of server instances. This static sizing and distribution of load has drawbacks in the performance and resource utilization when multiple clusters are deployed and operated in parallel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides methods and apparatus, including computer program products, for workload balancing in environments with multiple clusters of application servers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, the invention features a method for sharing resources from a pool of servers among a first cluster of servers and a second cluster of servers including determining a current workload of the first cluster, determining a current workload of the second cluster, calculating a combined workload of the first and second clusters, and allocating a first number of servers from the pool to the first cluster, the first number equal to a product of a total number of servers in the pool and the first server's workload divided by the combined workload.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In embodiments, allocating the first number of servers can include checking a current allocation of servers to the first cluster, reassigning a number of servers from the first cluster to the second cluster if the first number of servers can be less than the current allocation, and assigning a number of servers to the first cluster from the second cluster if the first number of servers can be greater than the current allocation. Each server from the pool can include two server instances, one for each cluster, and assigning a server to the first cluster can include activating a server application on the server for the first cluster.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Reassigning a server from the first cluster can include deactivating a server application on the server for the first cluster. Deactivating the server application on the server can include releasing resources on the server. Deactivating the server application on the server can include terminating a process previously spawned by the server application upon request by the first cluster. The server can execute a server application and assigning a server to the first cluster can include sending a command to the server instance to respond to requests from the first cluster. Reassigning a server from the first cluster can include sending a command to the server application to respond to requests from the second cluster.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Determining a current workload of the first cluster can include receiving a notification from a dispatcher for the first cluster. Determining a current workload of the first cluster can include querying a dispatcher for the first cluster.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, the invention features a system for sharing resources from a pool of servers among clusters of servers including a first and a second cluster of servers, each cluster including a dispatcher, the pool of servers, and a management system for the pool, the management system configured at least to dynamically assign servers from the pool to each cluster based on the cluster's relative portion of a total work load for the clusters.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In embodiments, the management system can be configured to maintain a table including, for each cluster, a current work load and currently allocated servers from the pool. Each server in the pool can execute one server application to handle requests for services by the clusters. Each server in the pool can execute a server application for each cluster to handle requests for services by the cluster. The management system can be configured to do at least the following: determine a current workload of the first cluster, determine a current workload of the second cluster, calculate a combined workload of the first and second clusters, and allocate a first number of servers from the pool to the first cluster, the first number equal to a product of a total number of servers in the pool and the first server's workload divided by the combined workload. Allocating the first number of servers can include checking a current allocation of servers to the first cluster, reassigning one or more servers from the first cluster to the second cluster if the first number of servers can be less than the current allocation, and assigning one or more servers to the first cluster from the second cluster if the first number of servers can be greater than the current allocation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Each server from the pool can maintain two server applications, one server application for each cluster, and assigning a server to the first cluster can include activating a server application on the server for the first cluster. Reassigning a server from the first cluster can include deactivating a server application for the first cluster. Deactivating the server application can include releasing resources on the server. Deactivating the server application can include terminating a process spawned by the server application upon request by the first cluster. The server can maintain a server application and assigning a server to the first cluster can include sending a request to the server application to respond to requests from the first cluster. Reassigning a server from the first cluster can include sending a request to the server application to respond to requests from the second cluster. Determining a current workload of the first cluster can include receiving a notification from a dispatcher for the first cluster. Determining a current workload of the first cluster can include querying a dispatcher for the first cluster.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. One implementation of the invention provides all of the above advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A central instance, which balances the workload over multiple clustered application servers, actively monitors a load of each cluster and maintains a table where a state of each cluster is indicated and upon which resources are assigned.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The provisioning of a resource for a cluster is done by activation/deactivation or instance sharing. There is no hard image copy or dynamic installation of software.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Resources are assigned for a cluster depending on the relative portion of the total load.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Since workload is centrally monitored and managed, resource assignment is accomplished in a clear and predictable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other features and advantages of the invention are apparent from the following description, and from the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary clustered application server environment <b>10</b> includes a clustered application server (i.e., cluster) <b>12</b>, a clustered application server (i.e., cluster) <b>14</b> and a resource balancing system (i.e., pool) <b>16</b>. Cluster <b>12</b> includes a network of application servers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and a dispatching system <b>22</b>. Dispatching system <b>22</b> includes a dispatcher <b>24</b>. In general, a dispatcher is a process that enables many clients to connect to the same server without the need for a dedicated server process for each client. A dispatcher handles and directs multiple incoming network session requests to shared server processes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><b>41</b> Cluster <b>14</b> includes a network of application servers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and a dispatching system <b>30</b>. Dispatching system <b>30</b> includes a dispatcher <b>32</b>. The resource control <b>33</b> assigns a resource (machine) to a specific cluster by starting/stopping respective activation/deactivation of server instances. The resource control <b>33</b> performs specific actions requested by a workload manager <b>34</b>. The resource balancing system <b>16</b> includes the workload manager <b>34</b> that maintains a workload table <b>36</b>. The workload table <b>36</b> includes, for example, a state indication of each cluster and a list of which resources are assigned to particular clusters. The resource balancing system <b>16</b> allows a dynamic sizing of clustered application servers (e.g., cluster <b>12</b> and cluster <b>14</b>) by assigning resources from the pool <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The amount of resources available for a cluster at a particular time is dependent on its current workload and an underlying balancing policy. More specifically, the amount of resources available for a cluster i at a time t is defined as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>R</i>(<i>t, i</i>)=<i>R</i><sub>static</sub>(<i>i</i>)+<i>R</i><sub>pool</sub>(<i>t, i</i>),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">where R<sub>static </sub>is the amount of resources assigned statically and R<sub>pool </sub>is the amount of resources assigned from the pool.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the following example, a resource is considered to be a computing device (e.g., machine) capable of running a single server instance. In programming, instantiation is the generation of a real instance or particular realization of an abstraction or template such as a class of objects or a computer process. To instantiate is to generate such an instance by, for example, defining one particular variation of an object within a class, giving it a name, and locating it in some physical place. In object-oriented programming, for example, some writers say that you instantiate a class to generate an object, a concrete instance of the class. The object is an executable file that can run in a computer. In approaches to data modeling and programming prior to object-oriented programming, one usage of instantiate was to make a real (data-filled) object from an abstract object as you would do by generating an entry in a database table (which, when empty, can be thought of as a kind of class template for the objects to be filled in). This association is valid for object oriented programming. Here a server instance is just the server process, i.e., a server machine is a single element in a cluster. One can have multiple instances on a single computer. The term &#x201c;instance&#x201d; is used to avoid confusion when people discuss &#x201c;servers&#x201d; whereby a physical computer plus one or more running server processes are referred.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Coordination and work load balancing in the environment <b>10</b> is performed by the workload manager <b>34</b> that manages the set of clusters <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and the dedicated pool <b>16</b> that includes a set of machines <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>. The workload manager <b>34</b> maintains the table <b>36</b> that stores/lists all assigned machines to each cluster and a current workload of each cluster. The table <b>36</b> is updated regularly, in the simplest example, by periodically requesting a current workload from each server in the cluster to calculate an overall workload. An assignment of resources (e.g., machines) is performed according to a balancing policy that defines the amount of machines a certain cluster can have at any given time, i.e., R(t, i). In a particular example, the following equation represents a workload balancing policy that assigns resources to a cluster depending on the cluster's relative portion of the total workload:</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">where R<sub>pool</sub>(t, i) is the amount of assignable resources (machines) for cluster i at time t, R<sub>total </sub>is the total amount of resources available in the pool, and L(t, i) is the workload of the cluster i at time t.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one particular example, assignment of resources is performed by activation and deactivation of server instances. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each cluster <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> has a server instance <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> running on each machine in the pool <b>16</b>, i.e., each machine has as many server instances as clusters and each instance on one machine belongs to a different cluster. The instances <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> are activated and deactivated respectively according to a load distribution. However, only one server can be active at a time while the other is inactive and does not consume resources. A deactivation of a server instance is done by detaching it from a dispatcher so that no requests from the dispatcher are served anymore.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although the activation and deactivation of server instances by attaching and detaching from the dispatcher allows fast reaction, resources may not be released by the instance since the entire process is still running (e.g., memory consumption, open sockets, database connections, and so forth). This resource consumption can be minimized by passivating the servers, either by shutting down components and services of the server so that only a minimum fragment of the server is running (e.g., micro-kernel), or by terminating the entire process of the server. While the first method reduces the resource consumption of the server to a minimum, the second method ensures that no resources are consumed anymore by the particular server.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one example, the overall load for each cluster is calculated by requesting the current workload for each associated server. These requests can be bandwidth consuming when the amount of managed resources and the amount of servers are very high. In a particular example, the load of a cluster can be provided by an associate dispatcher that informs its current workload status by notification or upon request.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another example, assignment of resources is performed by instance sharing. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, rather than having multiple server instances that are activated/deactivated according to the load, only one server runs on each machine. Depending on the load distribution the server is switched between the dispatchers of the managed clusters.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a process <b>100</b> for sharing resources from a pool of servers among a first cluster of servers and a second cluster of servers includes determining (<b>102</b>) a current workload of the first cluster and determining (<b>104</b>) a current workload of the second cluster. Process <b>100</b> calculates (<b>106</b>) a combined workload of the first and second clusters, and allocates (<b>108</b>) a first number of servers from the pool to the first cluster, the first number equal to a product of a total number of servers in a pool and the first server's workload divided by the combined workload.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Allocating (<b>108</b>) the first number of servers can include checking a current allocation of servers to the first cluster, reassigning a number of servers from the first cluster to the second cluster if the first number of servers is less than the current allocation, and assigning a number of servers to the first cluster from the second cluster if the first number of servers is greater than the current allocation. Each server from the pool can include two server instances, one for each cluster, and wherein assigning a server to the first cluster can include activating a server application on the server for the first cluster. Reassigning a server from the first cluster can include activating a server application on the server for the first cluster. Deactivating the server application on the server can include releasing resources on the server. Deactivating the server application on the server can also include terminating a process previously spawned by the server application upon request by the first cluster.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The server can execute a server application and wherein assigning a server to the first cluster can include sending a command to the server instance to respond to requests from the first cluster. Reassigning a server from the first cluster can include sending a command to the server application to respond to requests from the second cluster.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a particular example, determining (<b>102</b>) a current workload of the first cluster can include receiving a notification from a dispatcher for the first cluster. In another example, determining (<b>102</b>) a current workload of the first cluster can include querying a dispatcher for the first cluster.</p>
