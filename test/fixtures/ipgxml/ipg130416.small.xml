<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the development of electronic industries, the demand for increased functionalization and miniaturization of electronic parts is rapidly increasing. According to this trend, PCBs or circuit patterns are required to be increasingly dense, and thus, various methods of realizing a fine circuit pattern are being devised, proposed, and applied.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Among such methods of realizing a fine circuit pattern, the present invention discloses a method of removing the upper land of a via hole to thus achieve a high-density circuit pattern with a landless via hole.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a top plan view illustrating a conventional PCB, in which the upper land of a via is formed. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, because circuit patterns <b>105</b><i>a </i>are formed at small widths on a substrate but include the upper lands <b>104</b><i>b </i>of via holes <b>104</b><i>a </i>around the via holes <b>104</b><i>a</i>, fineness is not realized in the corresponding region. For example, in the case where the diameter of the via hole <b>104</b><i>a </i>is about 65 &#x3bc;m, the upper land around the via hole is formed at a width of about 165 &#x3bc;m in consideration of process error. In this way, because the upper land is formed, a high-density circuit pattern is difficult to realize on the substrate. Thus, a via arrangement is designed in a zigzag type (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) so that land portions do not overlap each other, but limitations are imposed on the ability to realize a high-density circuit pattern, attributable to the wider upper land.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, a landless via hole from which the upper land is excluded has been introduced. Korean Patent No. 688702 discloses a method of manufacturing a PCB with a landless via hole, in which a via hole has no upper land, using a photosensitive resist which is loaded in the via hole.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the landless via hole disclosed in Korean Patent No. 688702. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the landless via hole is formed such that a circuit pattern <b>1</b> is connected to the inner plating layer of a via hole <b>4</b> to thus realize a fine circuit pattern having no upper land. However, the case where the circuit pattern is connected to the inner plating layer of the via hole <b>4</b> is problematic in that the probability of poor contact is high and the process for manufacturing such a structure is complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, a PCB having a landless via hole and a method of manufacturing the same, in which the upper land of a via is removed in order to form a fine circuit pattern, and further, the connection between the via and the circuit pattern is good, are required.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems encountered in the related art and provides a PCB having a landless via hole and a method of manufacturing the same, in which the upper land of a via is removed, thus forming a fine circuit pattern, and further, the via can be efficiently connected with the circuit pattern.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the present invention, the second metal may have resistance to chemical etching different from those of the first metal and the third metal, so that the second metal is etched and the first metal and the third metal are not etched under the same chemical etching conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the present invention, the first metal and the third metal may be copper, and the second metal may be any one selected from among gold, silver, zinc, palladium, ruthenium, nickel, rhodium, lead-tin solder alloys, and nickel-gold alloys.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Hereinafter, a detailed description will be given of a PCB having a landless via hole and a method of manufacturing the same according to the present invention, with reference to the appended drawings. Throughout the drawings, like reference numerals refer to like elements, and redundant descriptions are omitted. In the description, the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d; and so on are used to distinguish one element from another element, but are not to be construed to limit the elements. Further, the terms and words used in the present specification and claims should not be interpreted as being limited to typical meanings or dictionary definitions, but should be interpreted as having meanings and concepts relevant to the technical scope of the present invention based on the rule in which an inventor can appropriately define the concept of the term to describe the best method he or she knows for carrying out the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the PCB having a landless via hole according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a top plan view illustrating the via region of the PCB. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a circuit pattern <b>30</b> according to the present invention is formed on the via <b>10</b>, and has a line width smaller than the diameter of a via hole.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The via <b>10</b> is responsible for electrical connection between a lower land <b>55</b> and the circuit pattern <b>30</b>, and is formed of a first metal. In the present invention, the first metal is copper.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The circuit pattern <b>30</b>, which is a conductive line in surface contact with the upper surface of the via <b>10</b>, comprises a seed layer <b>31</b> of a second metal and a plating layer <b>33</b> of a third metal, which have the same width as each other. The seed layer <b>31</b> of the second metal has a predetermined width, and the width of the plating layer <b>33</b> of the third metal is the same as that of the seed layer. Thus, the circuit pattern <b>30</b> has a rectangular shape, and the line width of the circuit pattern <b>30</b> is smaller than the diameter of the via <b>10</b> connected therewith. In this way, because the via <b>10</b> has no land, a circuit layer can be finely formed on the via <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the circuit pattern <b>30</b> is formed such that it is brought into surface contact with the upper surface of the via <b>10</b> across the via <b>10</b>, thus realizing a better electrical connection than a conventional circuit pattern connected to the inner plating layer of a via <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Here, the resistance of the second metal to chemical etching is different from those of the first metal and the third metal. This means that the second metal may be etched and the first metal and the third metal may not be etched under the same chemical etching conditions. For example, in the case where the first metal and the third metal are copper, the second metal may be any one selected from among gold, silver, zinc, palladium, ruthenium, nickel, rhodium, lead-tin solder alloys, and nickel-gold alloys. This is specifically described below. In the present invention, the second metal is nickel, and the third metal is copper.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the landless via hole according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in this drawing, the circuit pattern <b>30</b> has a cross-sectional shape of an inverted &#x201c;T&#x201d;. For convenience of description, a circuit pattern <b>30</b> located under the upper surface of the insulating layer <b>20</b> is referred to as a &#x201c;lower circuit pattern&#x201d;, and a portion of the circuit pattern <b>30</b> protruding from the upper surface of the insulating layer <b>20</b> is referred to as an &#x201c;upper circuit pattern&#x201d;. In the present embodiment, the line width of the upper circuit pattern, protruding from the upper surface of the insulating layer, is smaller than the diameter of the via <b>10</b>, thus making it possible to realize a high-density circuit pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Below, the method of manufacturing the PCB having a landless via hole according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention is described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4J</figref> sequentially illustrate the process of manufacturing the PCB having a landless via hole according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a double-sided substrate, comprising an insulating resin layer <b>50</b> and a first circuit layer formed on both surfaces thereof and having a lower land <b>55</b> of a via <b>10</b> and a circuit pattern <b>57</b>, is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4I</figref>, an insulating layer <b>20</b> is formed on the circuit layer, and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, a via hole <b>13</b> is formed in the insulating layer <b>20</b> so that the lower land <b>55</b> is exposed. To this end, the insulating layer <b>20</b> provided on the lower land <b>55</b>, where the via hole <b>13</b> is to be formed, is subjected to laser drilling, particularly, CO<sub>2 </sub>laser machining, thus forming the via hole <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, a plating layer <b>15</b> of a first metal is formed on the surface of the insulating layer <b>20</b>, including the inner surface of the via hole <b>13</b>. In the present invention, copper fill plating is conducted, thus forming the plating layer <b>15</b> of the first metal. The via hole <b>13</b> is filled with copper through electroless copper plating and copper electroplating.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, while the etching amount is adjusted, the portion of the plating layer <b>15</b> of the first metal is etched in the thickness direction so that the upper surface of the insulating layer <b>20</b> is exposed and the upper surface <b>23</b> of the insulating layer <b>20</b> is flush with the upper surface <b>17</b> of the plating layer loaded in the via hole <b>13</b>, thus forming the via <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The etching process is conducted by placing a substrate having the plating layer <b>15</b> of the first metal on a movable conveyor and then passing the substrate, moved by the conveyor, through a water bath containing an etchant. The etching amount is determined by the etching time, that is, the time during which the substrate is immersed in the etchant, and may be adjusted by controlling the passage and speed of the conveyor. In this way, only the plating layer <b>15</b> of the first metal, formed on the insulating layer <b>20</b>, is removed through etching, such that the upper surface <b>23</b> of the insulating layer <b>20</b> is flush with the upper surface <b>17</b> of the plating layer loaded in the via hole <b>13</b>. In the case where the portion of the plating layer <b>15</b> of the first metal is removed through etching using the method of the present invention, the upper surface <b>17</b> of the plating layer, loaded in the via hole <b>13</b>, may be positioned to be slightly lower than the upper surface <b>23</b> of the insulating layer <b>20</b>. However, this does not obstruct the embodiment of the present invention, and is described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>, a seed layer <b>31</b> of a second metal is formed through electroless plating on the upper surface <b>23</b> of the insulating layer <b>20</b> and the exposed surface <b>17</b> of the via <b>10</b>. As mentioned above, the second metal is a metal having resistance to chemical etching different from those of the first metal and the third metal. The electroless plating is a pretreatment process for forming a conductive film, which is necessary for copper electroplating. In the present invention, electroless plating using nickel is conducted, thereby forming the seed layer <b>31</b>. In the case where the nickel layer is formed through electrochemical deposition, it is known to exhibit deposition stability superior to other metals and to facilitate the formation of a uniform film having fewer deposition defects.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref>, a resist film <b>70</b> is applied on the seed layer <b>31</b>. In the present invention, a photosensitive resist film is used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4H</figref>, a resist pattern is formed. To this end, the resist film <b>70</b> applied on the seed layer <b>31</b> is subjected to exposure and development, thus forming an opening <b>73</b> in a circuit region corresponding to a second circuit layer including a circuit pattern <b>30</b> which is connected to the via <b>10</b>. The width of the opening <b>73</b> of the resist film <b>70</b> formed on the via <b>10</b> is smaller than the diameter of the via <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4I</figref>, the opening <b>73</b> is plated with a third metal, thus forming a plating layer <b>33</b> of the third metal having a line width smaller than the diameter of the via <b>10</b> on the via <b>10</b>. In the present invention, the third metal is copper. Although the first metal and the third metal are shown as being distinguished from each other, it should be noted that the first metal and the third metal are different from the second metal and that the first metal does not need to be different from the third metal.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4J</figref>, the residual resist film <b>70</b> is removed, and the exposed portion of the seed layer <b>31</b> is then removed through selective etching, thus completing the second circuit layer <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The seed layer <b>31</b>, made of nickel is selectively etched with the plating layer <b>33</b> of the third metal and the via <b>10</b>, made of copper. Various methods for selectively etching only a specific metal among different metals are known, and in the present invention, a nickel-selective etchant is used to selectively etch nickel with copper.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The nickel-selective etchant indicates a solution that dissolves only nickel or nickel alloy and does not dissolve copper. Using such a solution, without damage to the plating layer <b>33</b> of the third metal and the via <b>10</b>, only the nickel plating layer <b>31</b> may be removed. For the nickel-selective etchant, a 550&#x2dc;650 ml/l sulfuric acid solution, an acid mixture solution of sulfuric acid and nitric acid, and a mixture solution of sulfuric acid and m-nitrobenzene sulfonic acid are preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this way, the nickel plating layer <b>31</b> is selectively removed, thereby completing the PCB having a landless via hole.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, the process of selectively etching gold, silver, zinc, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, a lead-tin solder alloy or a nickel-gold alloy with copper is well-known, and is easily understood by one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate the case in which the upper surface of the via is etched to be lower than the upper surface of the insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in the procedure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, by which the portion of the plating layer <b>15</b> of the first metal is etched to expose the insulating layer <b>20</b>, the state in which the upper surface <b>17</b> of the via <b>10</b> is positioned to be lower than the upper surface <b>23</b> of the insulating layer <b>20</b> due to over-etching is illustrated. This phenomenon may be caused in the procedure of removing the plating layer <b>15</b> of the first metal formed on the insulating layer <b>20</b> using the method of the present invention. In this case, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a gap may be present between the resist film <b>70</b> and the upper surface <b>17</b> of the via <b>10</b>. This gap is fill-plated with the plating layer <b>33</b> of the third metal, thus forming the landless via shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Accordingly, even when the upper surface <b>17</b> of the via <b>10</b> is etched to be slightly lower than the upper surface <b>23</b> of the insulating layer <b>20</b>, a landless via hole may be realized. The completed landless via <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Through the aforementioned process according to the present invention, the via <b>10</b> is first formed, and the circuit pattern <b>30</b> is then formed on the via <b>10</b>, thus realizing a landless via hole having high reliability between the via <b>10</b> and the circuit pattern <b>30</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, assuming that the diameter D<b>1</b> of the via <b>10</b> is about 100 &#x3bc;m and that the line width W<b>1</b> of the circuit pattern <b>30</b> is about 30 &#x3bc;m, in the formation of the circuit layer, a matching error range O may be advantageously limited within &#xb1;35 &#x3bc;m. Hence, the manufacturing method of the present invention enables the manufacture of the PCB having the landless via hole with higher reliability between the via <b>10</b> and the circuit pattern <b>30</b>, compared to conventional landless methods.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As described hereinbefore, the present invention provides a PCB having a landless via hole and a method of manufacturing the same. In the PCB having a landless via hole according to the present invention, because a via has no upper land, a circuit pattern which is connected to the via can be finely formed, thus realizing a high-density circuit pattern, thereby enabling a reduction in the size of the PCB and the number of layers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, in the method of manufacturing the PCB having a landless via hole according to the present invention, a seed layer is formed with a second metal, which is different from the first metal for the via, and the seed layer is selectively etched, thereby enabling the formation of a circuit pattern which is efficiently connected to the via without damage to the via.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to power tools used for cutting work pieces, and more specifically relates to sliding miter saws.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During construction, manufacturing, and assembly operations, pieces of material such as wood, plastic, and metal (i.e. work pieces) must be cut to exact lengths, shapes, and dimensions. In many instances, power equipment and saws are used for cutting these work pieces. One type of saw, commonly referred to as a miter saw, has a cutting blade, a motor for driving the cutting blade, a horizontally-extending table, and a vertically-extending fence that cooperates with the table to support the work pieces during cutting operations. The horizontally-extending table provides a horizontal support surface for the work pieces, and the fence provides a vertical support surface for the work pieces. The cutting blade of a conventional miter saw is rotatable about a vertically-extending axis for making vertical cuts at various angles relative to the vertical support surface of the fence. These vertical cuts are typically referred to as miter cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many designs, the work piece-supporting fence is divided into two parts that are separated from one another by a gap, and the cutting blade is adapted to pass through the gap during a cutting operation. Each of the two fence parts has a vertically-extending support surface, and the two support surfaces lie in a common plane. The two fence parts may be movable relative to one another for adjusting the gap space between the two fence parts.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to conventional miter saws used to make vertical cuts, there are other types of miter saws that are used to make even more complex cuts. For example, a compound miter saw has a cutting blade that may be tilted at an angle relative to the horizontally-extending table, generally from 0 degrees to 45 degrees left of vertical. A cut made with the blade tilted at an angle to the horizontally-extending table, while remaining perpendicular to the front face of the fence, is known as a &#x201c;bevel cut.&#x201d; A cut made with the blade set at an angle relative to the front face of the fence (miter angle) and at an angle relative to the base (bevel angle) is known as a &#x201c;compound cut.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another type of miter saw is commonly referred to as a dual bevel compound miter saw, which has a tiltable structure that enables the cutting blade to be positioned at a range of angles relative to the table from 45 degrees left of vertical to 45 degrees right of vertical. This arrangement allows for even more &#x201c;compound cut&#x201d; variations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Still another type of miter saw is a slide miter saw including a rail system that enables the saw component to slide backward and forward over the table so as to increase the saw's cutting capabilities (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,067,885). Like non-sliding miter saws, slide miter saws have a base, a rotatable table attached to the base, a saw assembly including a motor, and a blade driven by the motor. The saw assembly is coupled with the table through a pivot arm that enables the saw assembly to be pivoted downwardly toward the table for cutting a work piece disposed on the table.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some instances, an operator may want to limit or stop sliding movement of the cutting assembly between the front and rear ends of the table. For example, DE 3 744 716 discloses a circular saw for a wood working bench having a cutting assembly that is connected with guide rails that enable the cutting assembly to slide in forward and rear directions relative to a cutting surface of a table. The circular saw includes a housing having openings through which the guide rails are adapted to slide. The guide rails are stopped from sliding by a locking element that engages one of the slide rails. When it is desired to once again slide the cutting assembly forwardly or rearwardly, the locking element may be loosened.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">EP 1 419 862 discloses a sliding compound miter saw having a latch hook provided on the cutting assembly and a latch post provided on a support housing for sliding guide rails. When the cutting assembly is near the support housing, the cutting assembly can be latched to the housing by engaging the latch post with the latch hook. After the latch is engaged with the latch post, the latch mechanism prevents a user from sliding the cutting assembly toward the forward end of the miter saw. When desired, the latch hook can be de-coupled from the latch post to once again permit forward sliding movement of the cutting assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In spite of the above advances, there remains a need for improved sliding miter saws having sliding rail stop features for maximizing cutting operations. There also remains a need for sliding miter saws that make it easier for operators to know when the cutting assembly is properly positioned for properly cutting different types and sizes of work pieces.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment of the present invention, a miter saw includes a base, a table disposed on the base, the table having a top surface extending between a front end and a rear end of the table, and a cutting assembly overlying the table, the cutting assembly including a rotatable cutting blade having a peripheral cutting edge, and a motor for driving the cutting blade. The miter saw desirably includes at least one guide rail interconnecting the table and the cutting assembly for guiding sliding movement of the cutting assembly over the table between a rear-most position and a forward-most position, and a locking assembly coupled with at least one of the cutting assembly and the at least one guide rail for locking the cutting assembly in an intermediate position located between the rear-most position and the forward-most position.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the miter saw preferably has a fence secured to the base, the fence having a front face overlying the top surface of the table and having a lower end that intersects the top surface of the table at a corner, whereby the peripheral cutting edge of the cutting blade intersects the corner when the cutting assembly is in the intermediate position. When the cutting assembly is in the intermediate position, the peripheral cutting edge of the cutting blade may also intersect the top surface of the table at a second location that is spaced from the corner defined by the intersection of the front face of the fence and the top surface of the table.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The miter saw desirably includes a support housing connected with the table that is adapted to guide sliding motion of the at least one guide rail. The at least one guide rail preferably has a longitudinal axis that extends in a first plane that is substantially parallel with the top surface of said table. The cutting assembly is preferably adapted to slide simultaneously with the at least one guide rail. In one embodiment, the at least one guide rail may be two guide rails that are positioned next to one another, and that are adapted to slide simultaneously with one another for guiding sliding movement of the cutting assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The miter saw desirably includes a linkage coupling a distal end of the cutting assembly with a proximal end of the at least one guide rail. The linkage may include a pivot for enabling the cutting assembly to be pivoted away from and toward the top surface of the table.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the locking assembly includes a latch coupled with the cutting assembly and a latch post coupled with the support housing. The latch is desirably movable for engaging the latch post for locking the cutting assembly in the intermediate position. In one embodiment, the latch has a proximal end pivotally connected with the cutting assembly, a distal end, a sloping surface extending from the distal end toward the proximal end of the latch, a slot located between the sloping surface and the proximal end of the latch, and a stop flange extending laterally from a side of the latch and being disposed between the slot and the proximal end of the latch. The engagement of the slot of the latch with the latch post preferably prevents sliding movement of the cutting assembly toward either the front end or the rear end of the table.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the locking assembly includes a groove formed in the at least one guide rail and a latch movable between a first position and a second position, whereby the latch is engageable with the groove when in the second position for locking the cutting assembly in the intermediate position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the intermediate position is an optimal cutting position for cutting certain types of work pieces such as crown moldings and tall base board pieces. As the cutting assembly slides between the rear-most and forward-most positions, the intermediate position is the location where the cutting assembly is best able to cut tall base board pieces and crown molding pieces. In other words, the intermediate position is the location where the tallest work pieces may be cut. This may be accomplished by shifting the blade washer and the pivot arm slightly forward of the rear-most position. The locking assembly is adapted to assist an operator in quickly, repeatedly, and reliably locating the cutting assembly at the intermediate position. In one embodiment, the forward shifting distance between the rear-most and the intermediate position is about 20-25 mm and more preferably about 22 mm. In one embodiment, the rear-most position is the optimal position for cutting one type of work piece, e.g. a 4&#xd7;4 work piece, and the intermediate position is the optimal position for cutting a different type of work pieces, e.g. tall base board pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, a miter saw includes a base, a table rotatably disposed on the base, the table having a top surface extending between a front end and a rear end thereof, and a cutting assembly overlying the table, the cutting assembly including a rotatable cutting blade having a peripheral cutting edge, and a motor for driving the cutting blade. The miter saw desirably has at least one guide rail coupled with the table and the cutting assembly for guiding sliding movement of the cutting assembly over the top surface of the table between the front and rear ends of the table, and a fence secured to the base and having a front face that overlies the top surface of the table, the front face having a lower end that intersects the top surface of the table at a corner, and a locking assembly coupled with at least one of the cutting assembly and the at least one guide rail for locking the cutting assembly in an intermediate position between the front and rear ends of the table. In the intermediate position, the peripheral cutting edge of the cutting blade intersects the corner defined by the intersection of the front face of the fence and the top surface of the table.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the locking assembly may include a groove formed in the at least one guide rail and a projection provided on the support housing that is engageable with the groove, whereby the groove is provided at a predetermined location along the length of the at least one guide rail for positioning the cutting assembly at the intermediate position when the projection is seated in the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, a miter saw preferably includes a base, and a table rotatably disposed on the base, the table having a top surface extending between a front end and a rear end of the table. The miter saw desirably has a guide rail support housing connected with the table, and at least one guide rail extending through the guide rail support housing, whereby the guide rail support housing is adapted to guide sliding movement of the at least one guide rail within a plane that is substantially parallel with the top surface of the table. The saw preferably includes a cutting assembly overlying the table, the cutting assembly including a rotatable cutting blade having a peripheral cutting edge, a motor for driving the cutting blade, and a linkage for selectively moving the cutting assembly relative to the top surface of the table. The at least one guide rail is desirably coupled with the cutting assembly for guiding sliding movement of the cutting assembly over the top surface of the table between the front and rear ends of the table. The saw also desirably has a fence secured to the base and having a front face that overlies the top surface of the table. The front face of the fence preferably has a lower end that intersects the top surface of the table at a corner, and a locking assembly coupled with at least one of the cutting assembly and the guide rail for locking the cutting assembly in an intermediate position between the front and rear ends of the table. In the intermediate position, the peripheral cutting edge of the cutting blade preferably crosses the corner defined by the intersection of the front face of the fence and the top surface of the table.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the cutting blade has a diameter of about 10 inches, and in the rear-most position the cutting assembly is adapted to cut a 4&#xd7;4 work piece and in the intermediate position the cutting assembly is adapted to cut a work piece having a height of at least 3.5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, a miter saw preferably has a cutting blade having a diameter of about 10&#x2033; and a 4&#x2033;&#xd7;4&#x2033; nominal size (3.5&#x2033;&#xd7;3.5&#x2033; actual size) work piece (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;4&#xd7;4 work piece&#x201d;) is positioned on a top surface of a table and against a front face of a fence so that a lower edge of the 4&#xd7;4 work piece is seated in a corner defined by the intersection of the fence and the table. During a cutting operation, with the cutting assembly in a rear-most position, as the cutting blade moves in a downward direction about a pivot, the peripheral cutting edge of the cutting blade is able to pass through the corner before the blade washer contacts an outer surface of the 4&#xd7;4 work piece. As a result, the 4&#xd7;4 work piece, including the portion of the 4&#xd7;4 work piece seated in the corner, may be completely cut before the blade washer contacts the 4&#xd7;4 work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the cutting blade is about 10&#x2033; in diameter and the miter saw is placed in the optimal position. When the cutting blade is pivoted to a left 45 miter position, the cutting blade is able to cut a TWP that is about 6 inches tall and 0.75 inches wide. When the cutting blade is pivoted to the 0 miter position, the cutting blade is able to cut a TWP that is about 6 inches tall and 0.9 inches wide. When the cutting blade is pivoted to a right 45 miter position, the cutting blade is able to cut a TWP that is about 3.5 inches tall and any thickness wide. In the alternative, for a nipped cut, when in the right 45 miter position, the cutting blade is able to cut a TWP that is about 6 inches tall and about 0.65 inches wide. As is well known to those skilled in the art, a &#x201c;nipped cut&#x201d; includes the steps of cutting a work piece to length at a 90 degree angle, and then cutting only the very end of the work piece at a desired angle. Although exact sizes and dimensions have been provided herein, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the specifications may be modified and still fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to limit the scope of the description or the claims. As used throughout this application, the word &#x201c;may&#x201d; is used in a permissive sense (i.e., meaning having the potential to), rather than the mandatory sense (i.e., meaning must). Similarly, the words &#x201c;include&#x201d;, &#x201c;including&#x201d;, and &#x201c;includes&#x201d; mean including but not limited to. To facilitate understanding, like reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate like elements common to the figures. For purposes of clarity, and in order to described one or more embodiments of the present invention, terms such as &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;horizontal,&#x201d; &#x201c;perpendicular,&#x201d; &#x201c;parallel,&#x201d; &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;rear,&#x201d; &#x201c;trailing,&#x201d; &#x201c;leading,&#x201d; &#x201c;first end,&#x201d; and &#x201c;second end&#x201d; have been used herein. Such terms are merely used to provide a frame of reference for the embodiments shown in the drawings and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment, a miter saw <b>20</b> includes a base <b>22</b>, and a table <b>24</b> rotatably coupled with the base <b>22</b> for being selectively rotated to a plurality of different angles for miter cutting. The table <b>24</b> has a top surface <b>25</b> that preferably extends in a substantially horizontal direction for supporting a work piece during a cutting, sizing, or shaping operation. The miter saw also desirably includes a compound pivot and slide mounting linkage <b>26</b>, a cutting blade <b>28</b>, a fixed blade guard <b>30</b> covering an upper part of the cutting blade, a motor <b>32</b> drivingly connected to the cutting blade <b>28</b>, a handle <b>34</b>, and an adjustable fence assembly <b>36</b> including a first fence section <b>38</b> and a second fence section (not shown). The miter saw <b>20</b> also has a moveable blade guard <b>40</b> that covers a front of the cutting blade and that is adapted to slide over the fixed blade guard <b>30</b> as the cutting blade is lowered toward the table <b>24</b>. The rotation of the table <b>24</b> changes the angle of the cutting blade <b>28</b> relative to the fence assembly <b>36</b>, but maintains the cutting blade <b>28</b> perpendicular to the horizontally-extending top surface of the table <b>24</b>. A locking mechanism <b>42</b> is movable between an unlocked position and a locked position for selectively unlocking and locking the table <b>24</b> for rotational movement relative to the base <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The compound pivot and slide mounting linkage <b>26</b> preferably couples the cutting blade <b>28</b> with the table <b>24</b>, and includes a pivoting structure that enables the cutting blade <b>28</b> to be pivoted with respect to the table <b>24</b> in order to provide adjustments for bevel cutting. As is well-known by those skilled in the art, the adjustments for mitering and beveling can be separate or they can be adjusted simultaneously in order to provide compound miter and bevel cuts. The pivoting of the compound pivot and slide mounting linkage <b>26</b> changes the angle of the cutting blade <b>28</b> relative to the table <b>24</b>, but maintains the perpendicularity of the cutting blade <b>28</b> with respect to the adjustable fence assembly <b>36</b>. One or more locking mechanisms may be engaged in order to lock the compound pivot and slide mounting linkage <b>26</b> from further movement relative to the table <b>24</b>. Thus, the cutting blade <b>28</b> may be locked at a plurality of different bevel angles, and the angle will not change so long as the one or more locking mechanisms remain locked.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The compound pivot and slide mounting linkage <b>26</b> includes a support housing <b>46</b> provided at an upper end thereof that is adapted to receive a pair of guide rails <b>48</b>A, <b>48</b>B for enabling forward and rearward sliding movement of a cutting assembly <b>50</b> that includes the cutting blade <b>28</b>, the fixed blade guard <b>30</b>, the motor <b>32</b> and the handle <b>34</b>. The cutting assembly <b>50</b> may be pivoted downwardly toward the horizontally-extending top surface <b>25</b> of the table <b>24</b>. This downward pivoting action opens the movable blade guard <b>40</b> to expose the cutting blade <b>28</b>. After the cutting blade has been exposed, it may be used to cut work pieces supported by the top surface <b>25</b> of the table <b>24</b> and the fence <b>36</b>. The sliding movement of the guide rails <b>48</b> relative to the support housing <b>46</b> enables the cutting assembly <b>50</b> and thus the cutting blade <b>28</b> to be pulled through the work pieces, including those instances where the size of the work piece exceeds the cutting width of the cutting blade.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment of the present invention, the adjustable fence <b>36</b> is interconnected with the base <b>22</b> and extends laterally across the horizontally-extending top surface of the rotatable table <b>24</b>. The adjustable fence <b>36</b> is adapted to support and properly align a work piece during a cutting operation. The adjustable fence <b>36</b> may include a first fence part having a fixed fence and a movable fence that is slideable over the fixed fence, and a second fence part having a fixed fence and a moveable fence section that is slideable over the fixed fence. The lateral spacing between the two movable fences provides clearance for the cutting blade <b>28</b> to perform a cutting operation completely through the work piece, regardless of the mode or type of cutting operation being performed. The movable fences are each movable toward and away from the cutting blade <b>28</b> in order to allow the operator to selectively adjust the clearance gap therebetween and thus accommodate the particular cutting operation being performed. The present invention may incorporate one or more of the fence embodiments disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/872,674, filed Oct. 15, 2007, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, the miter saw disclosed herein is capable of a number of different cutting modes or positions. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cutting blade <b>28</b> (shown in solid lines) may be positioned at an angle that is perpendicular to the support face of the adjustable fence <b>36</b> for performing a straight sliding or straight miter-cutting operation. The adjustable fence includes movable fences <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> that are selectively adjusted to provide an optimum clearance gap between the cutting blade <b>28</b> and the two movable fences <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, to permit the cutting blade <b>28</b> to be moved into the cutting position along a single, vertical plane, substantially perpendicular to both the front work piece-supporting face <b>56</b> of the adjustable fence <b>36</b> and the top surface <b>25</b> of the table <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). To permit miter cutting, as schematically illustrated in phantom lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first movable fence <b>52</b> is selectively adjusted, as indicated in phantom by reference numeral <b>52</b><i>a</i>, to increase the clearance gap <b>58</b> between the cutting blade <b>28</b><i>a </i>and the first movable fence <b>52</b>. The wider gap <b>58</b> preferably provides sufficient clearance for the cutting blade <b>28</b><i>a </i>and any components associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a front elevational view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, depicting the position of the cutting blade <b>28</b> and the movable fences <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> as solid lines for performing the above-described straight, square, and sliding cutting operation. The relative positions of the cutting blade <b>28</b> and the movable fence <b>52</b> are shown in phantom lines, as indicated by reference numerals <b>28</b><i>b </i>and <b>52</b><i>b</i>, respectively, for performing bevel cuts on a work piece (not shown). The plane of movement of the cutting blade <b>28</b><i>b </i>is generally perpendicular to the face of the fence assembly <b>36</b>, but can be selectively oriented at a bevel angle with respect to a top surface <b>60</b> of the table assembly <b>24</b>. As described above, the first movable fence <b>52</b> can be adjusted to a predetermined position, as shown in phantom at <b>52</b><i>b</i>, to accommodate the bevel angle selected for the cutting blade <b>28</b><i>b</i>. In one embodiment of the present invention, fence section <b>52</b> is slideable laterally over a first fixed fence <b>62</b>, and fence section <b>54</b> is slideable laterally over second fixed fence <b>64</b>. The two movable fences <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are capable of moving independently of one another for adjusting the size of the gap <b>58</b> therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Although not specifically illustrated in the drawings, one skilled in the art will readily recognize, from the exemplary positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, that a miter-cutting operation can be combined with a bevel-cutting operation in order to perform compound mitering. In a compound miter cut, the cutting blade <b>28</b> moves in a plane that is not perpendicular to either the front, vertically-extending face <b>56</b> of the adjustable fence <b>36</b> or to the top, horizontally-extending face <b>60</b> of the table <b>24</b>. In addition, although not specifically illustrated in the drawings, one skilled in the art will readily recognize, from the exemplary positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, that the miter-cutting operation and the bevel-cutting operation can be performed by angling the cutting blade <b>28</b> in the opposite direction from what is illustrated and then selectively adjusting movable fence <b>54</b> (to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) in a manner similar to that shown and described for movable fence <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus, the sliding compound miter saw <b>20</b> shown and described herein is capable of making at least four general types of cutting operations, namely sliding, miter-cutting, bevel-cutting and compound miter-cutting operations. The miter-cutting, bevel-cutting and compound miter-cutting operations can be performed by angling the cutting blade <b>28</b> in either direction from the sliding operation due to the incorporation of movable fences <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> on opposite sides of the cutting blade <b>28</b>. The miter saw preferably has infinite compound adjustability of the relative position and orientation of the cutting blade <b>28</b> relative to both the table <b>24</b> and the adjustable fence <b>36</b>. The infinite adjustability can be accomplished in the present invention by way of the compound pivot and slide mounting linkage <b>26</b> shown and described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The compound pivot and slide mounting mechanism <b>26</b> can be any of a number of well-known pivot and bevel mounting and support mechanisms which allow the cutting blade <b>28</b> and the fixed cutting blade guard <b>30</b> to be pivotally and slideably moved from a rear, raised, clear position to a lowered or cutting position. Once the miter saw <b>20</b> is adjusted to the desired operating mode, a cutting operation may be performed on a work piece by lowering the cutting blade <b>28</b> into the work piece and then moving the cutting blade <b>28</b> through the work piece. In order to allow a complete cut-through operation to be performed on the work piece by the cutting blade <b>28</b>, the fence assembly <b>36</b> must be capable of selective adjustment in order to adjust the lateral clearance gap or spacing between the cutting blade <b>28</b> and the two movable fences <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, while still providing adequate vertical support for the work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in one embodiment, the cutting blade <b>28</b> is secured to the cutting assembly <b>50</b> using a blade washer <b>70</b> and a locking screw <b>72</b>. In one embodiment, the cutting blade <b>28</b> has a diameter of about 10 inches and the blade washer <b>70</b> has a diameter of 2 inches. In other embodiments, the cutting blade and the blade washer may have smaller or larger diameters than set forth above. The blade washer <b>70</b> is tightened onto a major face of the cutting blade <b>28</b> using the locking screw <b>72</b>. After the blade washer <b>70</b> has been secured over the cutting blade using the locking screw, the cutting blade may not be removed. When it is desirable to replace the cutting blade, the locking screw <b>72</b> may be loosened for removing the blade washer <b>70</b> and then removing the cutting blade from the cutting assembly <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The miter saw <b>20</b> has a front end designated F, which is on the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and a rear end designated R, which is on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The guide rails <b>48</b>A, <b>48</b>B guide sliding movement of the cutting assembly <b>50</b> between the front end F and the rear end R of the table <b>24</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the cutting assembly <b>50</b> has been advanced to its rear-most position, with the guide rails <b>48</b>A, <b>48</b>B fully extended from the distal end of the guide rail support housing <b>46</b>. A guide rail stop <b>74</b> is secured to the distal ends of the guide rails <b>48</b>A, <b>48</b>B. Sliding movement of the cutting assembly <b>50</b> toward the forward end F is halted when a proximal end of the guide rail stop <b>74</b> abuts against the distal end of the guide rail support housing <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The fence <b>36</b> has a front face <b>56</b> that is adapted to support a work piece. The front face <b>56</b> of the fence <b>36</b> has an upper end <b>76</b> and a lower end <b>78</b> that intersects with the top surface <b>25</b> of the table <b>24</b>. The intersection of the front face <b>56</b> of the fence <b>36</b> and the top surface <b>25</b> of the table defines a corner <b>80</b> that is adapted to support an edge of a work piece. As the cutting assembly <b>50</b> slides between the forward end F and the rear end R, the cutting blade <b>28</b> may pass through a gap in the fence <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The miter saw <b>20</b> also preferably includes a locking assembly <b>82</b> that is adapted to secure the cutting assembly <b>50</b> at an intermediate, optimal cutting position that is located between the rear-most sliding position of the cutting assembly and the forward-most sliding position of the cutting assembly. In one embodiment, the intermediate position is located slightly forward of the rear-most position, and is a highly preferred position for cutting certain types of work pieces such as tall molding pieces (e.g. crown molding, tall base board moldings). The intermediate position may also be selected for maximizing the working area or working length of a cutting blade.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in one embodiment, the locking assembly <b>82</b> includes a latch <b>84</b> having a proximal end <b>86</b> pivotally secured to the cutting assembly <b>50</b> via a locking screw <b>88</b> and a distal end <b>90</b> having a slide ramp <b>92</b>. The locking assembly <b>82</b> desirably includes a latch post <b>94</b> that extends from the guide rail support housing <b>46</b>. The latch <b>84</b> preferably includes a locking slot <b>96</b> located between a proximal end of the slide ramp <b>92</b> and the proximal end <b>86</b> of the latch. The latch <b>84</b> also has a stop flange <b>98</b> extending from a distal end of the locking slot <b>96</b>. The stop flange <b>98</b> preferably defines the widest section of the latch <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As will be described in more detail below, in order to position the cutting assembly <b>50</b> at the intermediate, optimal cutting position, the slot <b>96</b> of the latch <b>84</b> first engages the latch post <b>94</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the latch post <b>94</b> is captured within the locking slot <b>96</b> of the latch <b>84</b> so that the cutting assembly <b>50</b> is arrested from further sliding movement between the rear and front ends of the miter saw. In one highly preferred embodiment, when the latch engages the latch post, the cutting assembly is locked from sliding movement and is incapable of sliding toward either the front end or the rear end of the miter saw. In order to once again slide the cutting assembly, the slot <b>96</b> of the latch <b>84</b> must be decoupled from the latch post. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that the latch <b>84</b> and the latch post <b>94</b> may be disposed on the support housing <b>46</b> and the cutting assembly <b>50</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the cutting assembly <b>50</b> of the miter saw <b>20</b> after it has been moved to its forward-most position. In the forward-most position, a gap exists between the peripheral edge <b>100</b> of the cutting blade <b>28</b> and the corner <b>80</b> between the front face <b>56</b> of the fence <b>36</b> and the top surface <b>25</b> of the table <b>24</b>. The forward sliding movement of the cutting assembly <b>50</b> is arrested by the guide rail stop <b>74</b> abutting against the distal end of the guide rail support housing <b>46</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the latch of the locking assembly <b>82</b> is in an upright, unlocked position, so that it does not contact the latch post <b>94</b>. As a result, the cutting assembly <b>50</b> is free to slide between the rear end R and the forward end F of the miter saw <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The miter saw <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> is adapted to cut work pieces having different sizes. In order to perform a cutting operation, the work piece is preferably supported by the top surface <b>25</b> of table <b>24</b> and pushed against the front face <b>56</b> of the fence <b>36</b> so that an edge of the work piece is disposed within the corner <b>80</b> defined by the intersection of the front face <b>56</b> of the fence <b>36</b> and the top surface <b>25</b> of the table <b>24</b>. During a cutting operation, as the cutting blade <b>28</b> passes through the work piece, the outer peripheral edge <b>100</b> of the cutting blade <b>28</b> preferably passes through the corner <b>80</b> so that the section of the work piece located at the edge <b>80</b> is cut. If the peripheral edge <b>100</b> of the cutting blade <b>28</b> is unable to reach the corner <b>80</b>, then the portion of the work piece disposed in the corner will not be cut. This may occur, for example, if the blade washer <b>70</b> contacts the work piece so as to prevent the peripheral edge <b>100</b> from reaching the corner <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> show how a locking assembly <b>82</b> locks a cutting assembly <b>50</b> in the intermediate, optimal cutting position, in one embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the latch <b>84</b> is pivoted into a generally horizontal orientation so that the slide ramp <b>92</b> is in substantial alignment with the latch post <b>94</b>. As the cutting assembly <b>50</b> is slid toward the rear end of the miter saw, the slide ramp <b>92</b> abuts against the shaft of the latch post <b>94</b>. Referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, further rearward sliding movement of the cutting assembly <b>50</b> causes the latch <b>84</b> to pivot in a clockwise direction as the slide ramp <b>92</b> slides over the latch post <b>94</b>. The cutting assembly may be slid further toward the rear end of the miter saw until the stop flange <b>98</b> of the latch <b>84</b> abuts against the latch post <b>94</b>. Once the stop flange <b>98</b> contacts the latch post <b>94</b>, further rearward sliding movement of the cutting assembly is halted. At that point, the latch <b>84</b> may be pivoted slightly in a counter-clockwise direction so that the latch post <b>94</b> is fully seated in the locking slot <b>96</b> of latch <b>84</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> shows the latch post <b>94</b> seated within the locking pocket of the latch <b>94</b>. With the latch <b>84</b> in this position, the cutting assembly <b>50</b> is stopped from further sliding movement toward either the front end or the rear end of the miter saw. Moreover, the cutting assembly <b>50</b> is positioned at the intermediate, optimal cutting position disclosed herein for maximizing the cutting capability of the miter saw for certain types of work pieces (e.g. tall molding pieces).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the locking assembly <b>82</b> in the locked position for holding the cutting assembly <b>50</b> and the cutting blade <b>28</b> at the intermediate, optimal cutting position, which is located between the front end F and the rear end R of the miter saw <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the latch <b>84</b> is engaged with the latch post <b>94</b> for preventing sliding movement of the cutting assembly <b>50</b>. As a result, the cutting assembly <b>50</b> is arrested from any sliding movement toward either the rear end R or the front end F of the miter saw. In the intermediate position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a proximal section of the guide rail <b>48</b> projects slightly from a proximal end of the guide rail support housing <b>46</b>, and the cutting blade <b>28</b> is positioned for maximizing cutting efficiency. In one embodiment, in the intermediate position, the peripheral cutting edge of the cutting blade <b>28</b> is preferably intersects the corner <b>80</b> so that the cutting blade <b>28</b> just cuts through the edge of the work piece located at the corner <b>80</b> between the fence <b>36</b> and the table <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the cutting assembly <b>50</b> and the cutting blade <b>28</b> locked in the intermediate, optimal position. In the intermediate position, the pivot <b>115</b> of the cutting assembly is slid forward of the rear-most position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) so that the peripheral cutting edge <b>100</b> of the cutting blade <b>28</b> just passes through the corner <b>80</b> defined by the intersection of the front face <b>56</b> of the fence <b>36</b> and the top surface <b>25</b> of the table <b>24</b>. As the cutting assembly is moved from the rear-most position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to the intermediate position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the blade washer <b>70</b> is preferably rotated away from the fence <b>36</b> to maximize the space between the blade washer <b>70</b> and the front face <b>56</b> of the fence <b>36</b>, which increases the size of a work piece that may be cut when using the miter saw. The intermediate position also maximizes the cutting ability of the cutting blade <b>28</b> in that the leading peripheral edge <b>100</b> of the cutting blade passes through a forward-most point <b>104</b> of the top surface <b>25</b> of the table <b>24</b>. The chord <b>106</b> of the cutting blade extending between the corner <b>80</b> and the forward point <b>104</b> is the working length L of the cutting blade. In one embodiment, this length L is at its maximum when the miter saw is placed in the intermediate, optimal position using the locking assembly shown and described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a miter saw <b>20</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention after the pivot <b>115</b> and the cutting assembly <b>50</b> are slid to the rear-most position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). In one embodiment, the miter saw <b>20</b> has a cutting blade <b>28</b> having a diameter of 10&#x2033; and a 4&#x2033;&#xd7;4&#x2033; nominal size (3.5&#x2033;&#xd7;3.5&#x2033; actual size) work piece (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;4&#xd7;4 work piece&#x201d;) is positioned on the top surface <b>25</b> of the table and against the front face <b>56</b> of the fence so that a lower edge of the 4&#xd7;4 work piece is seated in the corner <b>80</b>. During a cutting operation, as the cutting blade <b>28</b> moves in a downward direction about pivot <b>115</b>, the peripheral cutting edge <b>100</b> of the cutting blade <b>28</b> is able to pass through the corner <b>80</b> before the blade washer <b>70</b> contacts an outer surface of the 4&#xd7;4 work piece. As a result, the 4&#xd7;4 work piece, including the portion of the 4&#xd7;4 work piece seated in the corner <b>80</b>, may be completely cut before the blade washer <b>70</b> contacts the 4&#xd7;4 work piece. Stated another way, the peripheral cutting edge <b>100</b> of the cutting blade <b>28</b> is able to pass through the corner <b>80</b> before the blade washer <b>70</b> contacts the outer surface of the 4&#xd7;4 work piece. In contrast, as represented by the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the cutting blade in the rear-most position will be unable to cut a taller work piece (hereinafter referred to a &#x201c;TWP&#x201d;), such as a crown molding piece or a tall base board piece. This is because the blade washer <b>70</b> will contact a surface of the TWP before the peripheral cutting edge <b>100</b> of the cutting blade <b>28</b> passes through the lower edge portion of the TWP seated in the corner <b>80</b>. Thus, although the cutting assembly in the rear-most position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> can cut the 4&#xd7;4 work piece, it cannot cut completely through the TWP.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the miter saw <b>20</b> after the cutting assembly <b>50</b> and the pivot <b>115</b> have been moved to the intermediate, optimal cutting position, which is preferably located forward of the rear-most position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the cutting assembly is preferably secured in the intermediate position using one or more embodiments of the locking assembly described herein. In one embodiment, the pivot <b>115</b> is moved forward about 20-25 mm and more preferably about 22 mm from the rear-most position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) so as to place the cutting assembly <b>50</b> in the intermediate, optimal cutting position. As the pivot <b>115</b> is moved toward the forward end of the miter saw, the blade washer <b>70</b> also shifts toward the forward end of the miter saw so as to provide more space between the blade washer <b>70</b> and the front face <b>56</b> of the fence. In the optimal position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, as the cutting blade <b>28</b> moves downwardly to cut a work piece, the peripheral cutting edge <b>100</b> of the cutting blade <b>28</b> is able to pass completely through the corner <b>80</b> before the blade washer <b>70</b> engages a surface of the taller work piece TWP. However, as shown by dashed lines, the blade washer <b>70</b> will contact a 4&#xd7;4 work piece before the peripheral cutting edge <b>100</b> is able to pass through the corner <b>80</b> and completely cut the 4&#xd7;4 work piece. In other words, when the cutting assembly has been moved forward to the intermediate, optimal cutting position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the cutting assembly <b>50</b> can cut through a taller work piece TWP, but cannot cut through a 4&#xd7;4 work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment, when the miter saw is in the intermediate, optimal cutting position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the cutting blade <b>28</b> has a diameter of about 10&#x2033;. When the cutting blade <b>28</b> is pivoted to a left 45 miter position, the cutting blade is able to cut a TWP that is about 6 inches tall and 0.75 inches wide. When the cutting blade <b>28</b> is pivoted to the 0 miter position, the cutting blade is able to cut a TWP that is about 6 inches tall and 0.9 inches wide. When the cutting blade <b>28</b> is pivoted to a right 45 miter position, the cutting blade is able to cut a TWP that is about 3.5 inches tall and any thickness wide. In the alternative, for a nipped cut, when in the right 45 miter position, the cutting blade is able to cut a TWP that is about 6 inches tall and about 0.65 inches wide. As is well known to those skilled in the art, a &#x201c;nipped cut&#x201d; includes the steps of cutting a work piece to length at a 90 degree angle, and then cutting only the very end of the work piece at a desired angle. In one embodiment, when the miter saw is in the intermediate, optimal position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, when using a cutting blade having a 10&#x2033; diameter, at a left 45 miter the cutting assembly will cut at least about a 6&#x2033; tall TWP and in one embodiment preferably about 7&#x2033;, and at a right 45 miter the cutting assembly will cut at least about 3.5&#x2033; tall TWP. In one embodiment, the cutting assembly disclosed herein is capable of cutting a crown molding (positioned against the fence) having a height of at least 6.25 inches and a base board (positioned against the fence) having a height of at least 6 inches. Although exact specifications have been provided above, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the specifications may be modified and still fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a tall work piece TWP may be positioned at the corner <b>80</b> defined as the intersection of the front face <b>56</b> of the fence <b>36</b> with the top surface <b>25</b> of the table <b>24</b>. The TWP must fit between the blade washer <b>70</b>, the underside of the fixed blade guard <b>30</b>, and the front face <b>56</b> of the fence <b>36</b>. As is evident in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, when the cutting assembly is positioned more toward the rear end R of the miter saw <b>20</b>, the blade washer <b>70</b> contacts the TWP before the peripheral cutting edge of the cutting blade can cut completely through the TWP positioned against the fence <b>36</b>. Moreover, if the cutting blade <b>28</b> were positioned more toward the front end F of the miter saw <b>20</b> than in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> (e.g. the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> position), the peripheral edge <b>100</b> of the cutting blade <b>28</b> would not reach the corner <b>80</b> defined by the intersection of the fence <b>36</b> and the table top <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although a locking assembly including a latch and a latch post is shown and described above, it is contemplated that many different types of locking assemblies may be used for locating cutting assemblies at the intermediate, optimal cutting position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a preferred location for positioning the locking assemblies. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a miter saw includes a guide rail support housing <b>146</b> having openings for receiving guide rails <b>148</b>A, <b>148</b>B.

The projection <b>251</b> preferably engages a groove <b>253</b> formed in at least one of the guide rails <b>248</b>A, <b>248</b>B. The groove <b>253</b> is positioned so that the engagement of the projection <b>251</b> with the groove <b>253</b> positions the cutting assembly <b>250</b> at the intermediate, optimal cutting location described herein. When the projection <b>251</b> is not seated in the groove <b>253</b>, the guide rails <b>248</b>A, <b>248</b>B are adapted to slide freely between the rear-most position and the forward-most position.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14B</figref>, in one embodiment, a pivoting latch <b>355</b> may be provided between the guide rails <b>348</b>A, <b>348</b>B.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 USC 119 from Japanese Patent Applications Nos. 2008-058160, 2008-058159, and 2009-009055, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a printing plate making apparatus and a printing plate making method.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is known a printing plate making apparatus including a drum being provided at its outer peripheral surface with a recording plate (recording medium) and being rotated in a horizontal scanning direction, and a two-dimensional image on the recording plate being engraved t (recorded) on the recording plate by scanning the recording medium in a vertical scanning direction that is perpendicular to the horizontal direction with a laser beam in accordance with image data of an image that is to be engraved.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the above printing plate making apparatus, when a relief printing plate such as a flexographic printing plate and an intaglio printing plate such as a gravure is directly engraved by laser beam, it is required to satisfy both reproducibility of fine line or mesh point in shallow engraving (precision engraving) when engraving a narrow region and deep engraving (rough engraving) when engraving a wide region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since it is generally difficult to satisfy both two requirements at the same time, there is known a method in which laser beam having a small spot diameter for shallow engraving (precision engraving) and high power laser beam for deep engraving (rough engraving) are provided, and engraving is carried out using these laser beams separately (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,150,629, U.S. Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2006/0279794A1, and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2005-224481).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When printing is carried out using a relief printing plate such as a flexographic printing plate, if an edge shape of a convex portion formed on the plate is obtuse or a foundation which supports the convex portion is weak, printing density is varied by a pressing force against a printing medium, fine line or highlight point is not clearly printed or clear print is not carried out in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To reduce these problems, it is proposed to form a region remaining in convex shape such that a convex portion having rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation having a trapezoidal cross section (see JP-A No. 6-234262). To directly engraving a relief printing plate by laser beams at a higher speed, it is proposed to engrave a recording medium by exposing the recording medium to a light twice (see Japanese Patent No. 35562044).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, it is required to engrave a recording plate more precisely. In addition, when a recording medium is engraved by scanned twice, in order to print clearly, it is required to make a shape of a region which is to be left in convex shape to a shape wherein a convex portion having rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation having a trapezoidal cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The object that is to be achieved by the present invention is to solve the above problem.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A first aspect for achieving the above object relates to a printing plate making apparatus which scans a recording medium with a light beam at a predetermined pixel pitch, thereby engraving a surface of the recording medium to make a printing plate, wherein a light power of the light beam, which engraves all or part of a region which is adjacent to a convex portion which is to be left in a convex shape on a surface of the recording medium, is equal or less than a threshold engraving energy, and at a vicinity region in the vicinity of an outer side of the adjacent region, the light power of the light beam is increased to a level higher than the light power used in the adjacent region.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the printing plate making apparatus of the first aspect, the light power of the light beam emitted to all or part of the adjacent region which is adjacent to the convex portion in which the surface of the recording medium is to be left in a convex shape is reduced such that the exposure light of the light beam on the upper surface of the convex portion is equal or less than the threshold engraving energy. Accordingly, engraving on the upper surface of the convex portion is prevented or suppressed. Thus, the width of the upper surface of the convex portion may be brought closer to the desired width (desired width is secured or substantially secured).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">At the vicinity region in the vicinity of the outer side of the region in the adjacent region where the energy is equal or smaller than the threshold engraving energy, the light power of the light beam is increased than the light power at the adjacent region and the engraving is carried out, and thus, the inclination angle of the side surface of the convex portion becomes acute. In other words, the shape of the convex portion becomes closer to a rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The width of the upper surface of the convex portion may be closer to the desired width and the shape of the convex portion becomes closer to the rectangular shape. That is, the convex portion is precisely engraved. Thus, reproducibility of fine line or meshed point on a printing medium printed by a recording medium made into a plate is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">By the apparatus of the first aspect, even when a diameter of light beam is large, a convex portion is engraved precisely. Even when a diameter of light beam is small, a convex portion is engraved more precisely than when an apparatus that does not have the technical feature of the apparatus of the first aspect.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the printing plate making apparatus of the first aspect, since the width of the upper surface of the convex portion can made to be closer to the desired width and the shape of the convex portion becomes closer to the rectangular shape, there is an excellent effect that a recording medium can be precisely engraved.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The increasing amount of intensity of the light power of light beam at the vicinity region is determined by taking into consideration the type of the recording medium or the other.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The width of the adjacent region and the vicinity region are determined by taking into consideration the size of the convex portion, a beam diameter of light beam, the pixel pitch, and the type of recording medium or the other.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A second aspect for achieving the above object relates to the printing plate making apparatus of the first aspect, wherein the adjacent region comprises one pixel or more.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the printing plate making apparatus of the second aspect, since the width of the adjacent region is one pixel or more, the width of the upper surface of the convex portion may be brought closer to the desired width (the desired width is secured more reliably or substantially secured). Further, since the light power is controlled by pixel(s), it is easy to control the light power.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Therefore, the printing plate making apparatus of the second aspect has an excellent effect that the width of the upper surface of the convex portion may be brought closer to the desired width.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A third aspect for achieving the above object relates to the printing plate making apparatus of the first or second aspect, pulse exposure is carried out at a pulse width of one pixel or less and engraving is carried out at the vicinity region.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the printing plate making apparatus of the third aspect, the recording plate is pulse-exposed with a pulse width of one pixel or less and engraved, thereby the inclination angle of the side surface of the convex portion becomes more acute. In other words, the shape of the convex portion is brought closer to the rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The pulse exposure mentioned here means control in which the light power of light beam is turned &#x201c;OFF&#x2192;ON&#x2192;OFF&#x201d;, and the pulse width means a width (interval) during which the light power is ON.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A fourth aspect for achieving the above object relates to the third aspect, wherein the pulse width of the pulse exposure is 0.5 pixels or less.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the printing plate making apparatus of the fourth aspect, since the pulse width of the pulse exposure is 0.5 pixels or less, the inclination angle of the side surface of the convex portion becomes more acute. In other words, the shape of the convex portion is brought closer to the rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A fifth aspect for achieving the above object relates to the printing plate making apparatus of the third aspect, wherein the pulse width of the pulse exposure is 0.25 pixels or less.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the printing plate making apparatus of the fifth aspect, since the pulse width of the pulse exposure is 0.25 pixels or less, thereby the inclination angle of the side surface of the convex portion becomes more acute. In other words, the shape of the convex portion is brought closer to the rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The printing plate making apparatus of the third to fifth aspects exhibit an excellent effect that the shape of the convex portion may be brought closer to the rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A sixth aspect for achieving the above object relates to the printing plate making apparatus of any one of the first to fifth aspects, wherein the light beam engraving the recording medium is focused by an imaging lens after being emitted from a fiber array light source.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the printing plate making apparatus of the sixth aspect, after the light beam is emitted from the fiber array light source, the light beam is focused by an imaging lens to engrave the recording medium. Therefore, as compared with an expensive light source such as a fiber laser and CO<sub>2 </sub>laser, the cost of the printing plate making apparatus may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Nevertheless, the width of the upper surface of the convex portion may be brought close to the desired width and the shape of the convex portion may be brought close to the rectangular shape. That is, the reproducibility of fine lines or meshed points on a printing medium printed by a recording medium after being engraved by light beam scanning may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the printing plate making apparatus of the sixth aspect, there is an excellent effect that cost may be reduced compared with a printing plate making apparatus having an expensive light source such as a fiber laser.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A seventh aspect for achieving the above object relates to a printing plate making method, the method comprising scanning a recording medium by light beam by a predetermined pixel pitch, thereby engraving a surface of the recording medium to make a printing plate, wherein a light power of the light beam engraving all or part of an adjacent region which is adjacent to a convex portion which is to be left in a convex shape on a surface of the recording medium is reduced to so as to be equal to or less than a threshold engraving energy, and the light power of a light beam for engraving a region in the vicinity of an outer side of the adjacent region is increased to a value higher than the light power used in the adjacent region.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the printing plate making method of the seventh aspect, the width of the upper surface of the convex portion may be brought close to the desired width and the shape of the convex portion may be brought close to the rectangular shape. Therefore, the convex portion is precisely engraved. Thus, the reproducibility of fine lines or meshed points on a printing medium printed by a recording medium that is made into a printing plate is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The threshold engraving energy is a light energy of a light beam required for engraving a surface of the recording medium, and if the light energy is smaller than the threshold engraving energy, the recording medium is not be engraved. In other words, even if the recording medium is exposed to light beam having a light energy equal to or smaller than the threshold engraving energy, the surface of the recording medium is not engraved. The threshold engraving energy differs depending upon the type (material) of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to the seventh aspect, since the width of the upper surface of the convex portion may be brought close to the desired width and the shape of the convex portion may be brought close to the rectangular shape, there is an excellent effect that the recording medium is precisely engraved.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An eighth aspect for achieving the above object relates to a printing plate making apparatus which scans a recording medium by a light beam at a predetermined pixel pitch, thereby engraving the recording medium to make a printing plate, wherein the light beam includes a first light beam and a second light beam, a light power of the first light beam is defined as P<b>1</b>, a light power of the second light beam is P<b>2</b>, and depths engraved by the respective light powers are d<b>1</b> and d<b>2</b>; after the recording medium is scanned by one of the light beams in a predetermined pixel pitch to a first depth d<b>1</b> or d<b>2</b>, a scanning line scanned by the one light beam is scanned by the other light beam; and the recording medium is engraved to a second depth d<b>1</b>+d<b>2</b> which is deeper than the first depth.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An upstream end of a convex portion constituting an upper portion of a region where the recording medium is to be left in a convex shape is defined as an upstream reference position; light power control of the first light beam is carried out such that when the recording medium is scanned at a predetermined pixel pitch with the first light beam, from a first point separated away from the upstream reference position by m pixels upstream in the scanning direction or the vicinity thereof, to a second point which is separated away from the upstream reference position on the surface of the recording medium downstream in the scanning direction by n pixels, a light power of the first light beam is reduced linearly or substantially linearly from P<b>1</b> so that at the upstream reference position or the vicinity thereof the light power of the first light beam is equal to or less than a threshold engraving energy. When the recording medium is scanned by the second light beam at a predetermined pixel pitch to engrave, from a third point separated away from the upstream reference position in the upstream in the scanning direction by (2m+n)&#xd7;(P<b>2</b>/P<b>1</b>) pixels or the vicinity thereof, the light power of the second light beam is reduced linearly or substantially linearly from P<b>2</b> such that it becomes the threshold engraving energy or less at the first point or the vicinity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the printing plate making apparatus of the eighth aspect, when scanning the recording medium by the first light beam at the predetermined pixel pitch and engraving at the first depth, from the first point that is a point separated away from the upstream reference position upstream in the scanning direction by m pixels or the vicinity thereof along the line segment connecting the first point in the first depth and the second point that is a point separated away from the upstream reference position in the surface of the recording medium downstream in the scanning direction by n pixels, the light power of the first light beam is reduced linearly or substantially linearly from P<b>1</b>, and the energy is set to be equal to or less than the threshold engraving energy at the upstream reference position or the vicinity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the recording medium is scanned by the second light beam in the predetermined pixel pitch and engraved at the second depth, the light power of the second light beam is reduced linearly or substantially linearly from P<b>2</b> along the line segment connecting the first point and the third point which is separated away from the upstream reference position upstream in the scanning direction by (2m+n)&#xd7;(P<b>2</b>/P<b>1</b>) pixels or the vicinity thereof, and the energy is set to be equal to or less than the threshold engraving energy at the first point or the vicinity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">By controlling the light power in the above described manner, the convex portion having a substantially rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation having a substantially trapezoidal cross section upstream in the scanning direction of the region which is to be left in a convex shape. For example, an inclined surface which is engraved by the second light beam is substantially straightly connected to an inclined surface of the foundation having the trapezoidal cross section upstream in the scanning direction when it is engraved by the first light beam.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Therefore, even if the recording medium is engraved by scanning twice and, the cross section shape of the region which is to be left in a convex shape may be brought close to a shape that a convex portion having a substantially rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation having a substantially trapezoidal cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Accordingly, deviation of printing density in accordance with a pressure applied from a recording medium that is made into a printing plate (a printing plate) to a printing medium and failure of clearly printing a fine line or a high light point are prevented or suppressed, and therefore, clear printing can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to the printing plate making apparatus of the eighth aspect, when the recording medium is engraved by scanning twice, the shape of the region which is to be left in a convex shape may be brought close to a shape such that a convex portion having a substantially rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation having a substantially trapezoidal cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A ninth aspect for achieving the above object relates to the printing plate making apparatus of the eighth aspect, wherein when engraving all or part of an adjacent region which is adjacent upstream in the scanning direction to a convex portion forming an upper portion of a region where a surface of the recording medium is to be left in a convex shape, a light power of the first light beam is reduced so as to be equal to or less than the threshold engraving energy, at the upper surface of the convex portion, and in a vicinity region which is in the vicinity of an outer side of an upstream side of the adjacent region in the scanning direction, the light power of the first light beam is set higher than the light power of the first beam when engraving along a line segment connecting the first point and the second point.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the printing plate making apparatus of the ninth aspect, the light power of the first light beam emitted to all or part of the adjacent region which is adjacent to the convex portion upstream in the scanning direction is reduced such that the exposure of the light beam to the upper surface of the convex portion is carried out at an intensity equal to or less than the threshold engraving energy. Accordingly, engraving the upper surface of the convex portion is prevented or suppressed. Thus, the width of the upper surface of the convex portion is brought closer to the desired width.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At the vicinity region which is adjacent to the outer side upstream in the scanning direction of the region in the adjacent region where a light energy is set to be equal to or less than the threshold engraving energy, the region is engraved while increasing the light power of the first light beam higher than the light power of the first light beam when engraving along the line segment connecting the first point and the second point. Accordingly, the inclination angle of the side surface of the convex portion becomes acute. In other words, the shape of the convex portion becomes close to the rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Accordingly, the width of the upper surface of the convex portion formed on top of the foundation having a substantially trapezoidal cross section is brought close to the desired width, and the shape of the convex portion becomes close to the rectangular shape. That is, the convex portion is engraved precisely. Thus, the reproducibility of fine line or meshed point on a printing medium printed by a recording medium made into a printing plate is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to the printing plate making apparatus of the tenth aspect, the shape of the cross section of a convex portion formed on top of a foundation having a substantially trapezoidal cross section may be brought closer to the rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An eleventh aspect for achieving the above object relates to a printing plate making apparatus which scans a recording medium by a light beam at a predetermined pixel pitch, thereby engraving a surface of the recording medium to make a printing plate, wherein: the light beam includes a first light beam and a second light beam, a light power of the first light beam is P<b>1</b>, a light power of the second light beam is P<b>2</b>, and depths engraved by the respective light powers are d<b>1</b> and d<b>2</b>; after scanning the recording medium with one of the light beams at a predetermined pixel pitch to engrave the recording medium to a first depth d<b>1</b> or d<b>2</b>, a scanning line scanned by the one light beam is scanned by the other light beam and the recording medium is engraved to a second depth d<b>1</b>+d<b>2</b> which is deeper than the first depth; a downstream end of a convex portion forming an upper portion of a region where the recording medium is to be left in a convex shape downstream in the scanning direction is defined as a downstream reference position; light power control of the light beam is carried out such that, when the recording medium is scanned at a predetermined pixel pitch with the first light beam, the light power of the first light beam is set to be equal to or greater than the threshold engraving energy at the downstream reference position or the vicinity thereof; from a fifth point separated from the downstream reference position downstream in the scanning direction by m pixels to a sixth point on a surface of the recording medium separated from the downstream reference position in the scanning direction by n pixels, the light power of the first light beam is increased linearly or substantially linearly, and is set to P<b>1</b> at the fifth point or the vicinity thereof; and when the recording medium is scanned at a predetermined pixel pitch by the second light beam, a light power of the second light beam is equal to or greater than the threshold engraving energy at the fifth point or the vicinity thereof, and towards a seventh point separated from the fifth point and the downstream reference position downstream in the scanning direction by (2m+n)&#xd7;(P<b>2</b>/P<b>1</b>) pixels, the light power is increased linearly or substantially linearly and set to P<b>2</b> at the seventh point or the vicinity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the printing plate making apparatus of the eleventh aspect, when scanning the recording medium by the first light beam at a predetermined pixel pitch, thereby engraving the recording medium at a first depth, the light power of the first light beam is set so as to be equal or lower than the threshold engraving energy, and then, from the downstream reference position or the vicinity thereof the light power is increased linearly or substantially linearly along the line segment connecting the fifth point at the first depth which is separated from the downstream reference position downstream in the scanning direction by m pixels and the sixth point in the surface of the recording medium which is separated away from the downstream reference position upstream in the scanning direction by n pixels, and the light power is set to P<b>1</b> at the fifth point or the vicinity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When scanning the recording medium by the second light beam at a predetermined pixel pitch and engraving the recording medium at a second depth, the light power of the second light beam is set so as to be equal or higher than the threshold engraving energy, from the fifth point or the vicinity thereof and then, the light power is increased linearly or substantially linearly along the line segment connecting the fifth point and the seventh point at the second depth separated away from the downstream reference position downstream in the scanning direction in (2m+n)&#xd7;(P<b>2</b>/P<b>1</b>) pixels, and the light power is set to P<b>2</b> at the seventh point or the vicinity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">By controlling the light power in this manner, a convex portion having a substantially rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation having a substantially trapezoidal cross section downstream in the scanning direction of the region which is to be left in a convex shape. For example, an inclined surface which is engraved by the second light beam is substantially straightly connected to an inclined surface of the foundation having the trapezoidal cross section downstream in the scanning direction when it is engraved by the first light beam.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Therefore, even if the recording medium is engraved by scanning twice, the cross section shape of the region which is to be left in a convex shape may be brought close to a shape such that a convex portion having the substantially rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation having a substantially trapezoidal cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Accordingly, for example, it can be prevented or suppressed that deviation of pressing force applied from a recording medium made into a printing plate to a printing medium causes printing density deviation and that fine lines or highlight points are not printed clearly, and therefore, clear printing may be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the printing plate making apparatus of the eleventh aspect, when the recording medium is engraved by scanning twice, the shape of the region which is to be left in a convex shape may be brought close into such a shape that a convex portion having a substantially rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation having a substantially trapezoidal cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A twelfth for achieving the above object relates to the printing plate making apparatus of the eleventh aspect wherein a light power of the first light beam, which engraves all or part of an adjacent region which is adjacent to a convex portion downstream in the scanning direction of the convex portion which forms an upper portion of a region where a surface of the recording medium is to be left in a convex shape, is reduced so as to be equal or smaller than the value of the threshold engraving energy; at the upper surface of the convex portion, and in the vicinity region in vicinity of an outer side of an adjacent region upstream in the scanning direction, light power of the first light beam is increased higher than the light power of the first light beam when engraving along a line segment connecting the fifth point and the sixth point.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to the printing plate making apparatus of the twelfth aspect, the light power of the first light beam emitted to all or a part of the adjacent region which is adjacent to the downstream in the scanning direction of the convex portion constituting the upper portion of the region where the surface of the recording medium is left in a convex shape is reduced such that the exposure of the light beam emitted to the upper surface of the convex portion becomes to be equal or less than the threshold engraving energy. Accordingly, engraving of the upper surface of the convex portion is prevented or suppressed. Thus, the width of the upper surface of the convex portion is brought closer to the desired width.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At the vicinity region which is in the vicinity of the outer side downstream in the scanning direction of the region in the adjacent region where the light energy is equal to or less than the threshold engraving energy, the region is engraved while increasing the light power of the first light beam as compared with the light energy when engraving along the line segment connecting the fifth point and the sixth point. Thus, the inclination angle of the side surface of the convex portion becomes acute. In other words, the shape of the convex portion becomes close to the rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Consequently, the width of the upper surface of the convex portion formed on top of the foundation having a substantially trapezoidal cross section is brought close to the desired width, and the shape of the convex portion becomes close to the rectangular shape. That is, the convex portion is engraved precisely. Thus, the reproducibility of fine lines or meshed points on a printing medium printed by a recording medium made into a printing plate is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to the printing plate making apparatus of the twelfth aspect, the shape of a cross section of a convex portion formed on top of a foundation having a substantially trapezoidal cross section may be brought closer to the rectangular shape.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to the printing plate making apparatus of the fifteenth aspect, the recording medium is scanned by the light beam in the horizontal scanning direction and the vertical scanning direction perpendicular to the horizontal scanning direction. Consequently, the region which is to be left in a convex shape is formed into the substantially rectangular shape as viewed from above. On at least one side of the substantially rectangular shape, a convex portion having a substantially rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation having a substantially trapezoidal cross section.</p>

The width of the upper surface P<b>5</b> of the convex fine line P is a portion of the threshold engraving energy or less and thus, the side is wider by &#x3b1;<b>1</b> in the drawing to be precisely. A bottom side of the trapezoidal shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</figref> is about 20 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10E</figref>, although the width of the upper surface P<b>5</b> of the convex fine line P may be close to about desired 20 &#x3bc;m, the inclination angles of the sidewalls P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> upstream and downstream of the convex fine line P in the scanning direction are gentle. The angle of the edge portion E constituted by the upper surface P<b>5</b> and the sidewalls P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> falls (more than 90&#xb0;). However, in order to print a file line after printing precisely, it is necessary to erect the edge portion E (it is necessary to bring the angle close to 90&#xb0;). That is, it is necessary to bring the inclination angles of the sidewalls P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> close to 90&#xb0; (vertical).</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Hence, in the printing plate making apparatus <b>11</b> of the exemplary embodiment, the invention is applied, the light power by outer one pixel in which laser beam is OFF is increased, thereby bringing the inclination angles of the sidewalls P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> close to 90&#xb0; (vertical). That is, the edge portion E is erected (closer to 90&#xb0;). With this, the cross section shape of the convex fine line P is brought closer to a rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Since the width of the upper surface P<b>5</b> of the convex fine line P is a portion where the energy is the threshold engraving energy or less and thus, to be precise, the width is wider by &#x3b1;<b>2</b> in the drawing, however since the inclination angles of the sidewalls P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are brought closer to vertical, this is extremely slight and no problem occurs. The increasing width for increasing the light power of laser beam may be increased or width at which the pixel exposure amount signal is turned OFF may be slightly narrowed to narrow by &#x3b1;<b>2</b> (to bring the width closer to desired 21.2 &#x3bc;m).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In the printing plate making apparatus <b>11</b> of this exemplary embodiment, the light power is turned OFF in one pixel upstream and downstream in the scanning direction in region adjacent to the convex fine line P, the light power of one pixel (vicinity region) in vicinity of outer side where the laser beam is turned OFF is increased, whereby bringing the inclination angles of the sidewalls P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> closer to vertical (edge portion E is erected (closer to 90&#xb0;)).</p>

That is, the convex fine line P may precisely be engraved. Thus, the reproducibility of fine line in a printing medium printed by a recording plate F after the plate is made may be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18C</figref>, the pixel exposure amount signal of the laser beam may not be turned OFF (light power is 0(zero)) by one pixel (total two pixels) upstream and downstream in the scanning direction of the convex fine line P having about 20 &#x3bc;m width, and the light power control may be performed such that exposure is carried out at threshold engraving energy or less.</p>

In this case, even if the pixel exposure amount signal of laser beam is turned OFF, the convex fine line P is also exposed to light. Further, since the spot diameter D is as large as &#x3c6;40 &#x3bc;m, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>, laser beams are overlapped on the convex fine line P and the integrating energy is increased.

In this case also, since the spot diameter D is as large as &#x3c6;40 &#x3bc;m, the convex fine line P is also exposed to light.

The engraving is carried out while increasing the light power than a line segment connecting the first point Q<b>1</b> and the second point Q<b>2</b> by one pixel on the outer side upstream in the scanning direction in which laser beam LA is turned OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Similarly, light power control in which the pixel exposure amount signal of laser beam LA is turned OFF is carried out also for one pixel of the convex fine line P downstream in the scanning direction. The engraving is carried out while increasing the light power than a line segment connecting the fifth point Q<b>5</b> and the sixth point Q<b>6</b> by one pixel on the outer side downstream in the scanning direction in which laser beam LA is turned OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">By performing such light power control, the width of the upper surface P<b>5</b> of the convex fine line P may be brought closer to the desired width and the edge portion (PA, PB) further erect (brought closer to 90&#xb0;). That is, the cross section shape of the convex fine line P becomes closer to the rectangular shape (the convex fine line P is precisely engraved). Thus, reproducibility of fine line on a printing medium printed by a recording plate F after the plate is made is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Although the scanning is carried out using laser beam LA and then the scanning is carried out using laser beam LB in this control method, the invention is not limited to this. Even when the scanning is carried out using laser beam LB and then the scanning is carried out using laser beam LA, if the same power control is performed, the shape of the region W to be left in a convex shape may be brought close into such a shape that a convex fine line P having a substantially rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation D having a substantially trapezoidal cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Next, the fact that the same engraved shape may be obtained irrespective of which one of laser beam LA and laser beam LB is scanned first, i.e., the fact that the shape of the region W to be left in a convex shape may be brought close into such a shape that a convex fine line P having a substantially rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation D having a substantially trapezoidal cross section irrespective of which one of laser beam LA and laser beam LB is scanned first will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">A depth which may be engraved by laser beam LA is defined as d<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, and a depth which may be engraved by laser beam LB is defined as d<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>. Here, the depth of d<b>1</b>+d<b>2</b> is equal to the second depth L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>, when scanning operation is carried out using laser beam LA to engrave, the light power of the laser beam LA is reduced from P<b>1</b> linearly or substantially linearly from a first point or the vicinity thereof along a line segment connecting the first point separated from the upstream reference position upstream in the scanning direction by m pixels and a second point separated from the upstream reference position on the surface FA of the recording plate F downstream in the scanning direction, and the energy is set to the threshold engraving energy or less at the upstream reference position or the vicinity thereof. That is, the light power of laser beam LA starts lowering from the first point or the vicinity thereof, and the energy is set to the threshold engraving energy or less at the upstream reference position or the vicinity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The scanning is carried out while the width of the convex fine line P in the scanning direction is set to the threshold engraving energy or less and then, the light power of the laser beam LA is increased linearly or substantially linearly to the threshold engraving energy or higher from the downstream reference position or the vicinity thereof, and the point is set to P<b>1</b> at the fifth point or the vicinity thereof. At that time, the light power is increased linearly or substantially linearly along a line segment connecting the fifth point separated away from the downstream reference position downstream in the scanning direction by m pixels and the sixth point separated away from the downstream reference position in the surface FA of the recording plate F upstream in the scanning direction by n pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref>, when scanning is carried out by laser beam LB and engraving the plate, the light power of the laser beam LB is reduced from P<b>2</b> linearly or substantially linearly from the third point or the vicinity thereof along a line segment connecting the third point separated away from the upstream reference position upstream in the scanning direction in (2n+m) pixels and the first point, and the energy is set to the threshold engraving energy or less at the first point or the vicinity thereof. That is, the light power of the laser beam LB starts lowering at the third point or the vicinity thereof, and the energy, becomes the threshold engraving energy or lower at the first point or the vicinity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The width of the convex fine line P in the scanning direction is set to the threshold engraving energy or less and the scanning is carried out and then, the light power of the laser beam LB is increased to the threshold engraving energy or higher from the fifth point or the vicinity thereof, the light power is increased linearly or substantially linearly, and the point is set to P<b>2</b> at the seventh point or the vicinity thereof. The light power is increased linearly or substantially linearly along a line segment connecting the fifth point and the seventh point separated away from the downstream reference position downstream in the scanning direction by (2m+n) pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Here, if the scanning is carried out by the laser beam LB after the scanning is carried out by the laser beam LA, the light power control is the same as that described heretofore. Even when the scanning is carried out by the laser beam LA after the scanning is carried out by the laser beam LB, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</figref>, since the total exposure energy, of the laser beam LA and the laser beam LB is the same, substantially the same engraved shape may be obtained. That is, irrespective of which one of the laser beam LA and laser beam LB is scanned and exposed first, since the total exposure energy is the same, the shape of the region W to be left in a convex shape may be brought close into such a shape that a convex fine line P having a substantially rectangular cross section is formed on top of a foundation D having a substantially trapezoidal cross section. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref> schematically shows the cross section shape extending along the horizontal scanning direction of the region W to be left to the convex shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref> is a graph showing both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25B and 26B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</figref> is a graph showing the total energy, of the laser beam LA and the laser beam LB.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">In the above description, since P<b>1</b>=P<b>2</b>, the first point and the seventh point are separated from the upstream reference position or the downstream reference position by (2m+n) pixels. However, when P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are different from each other, the first point Q<b>1</b> or the seventh point Q<b>7</b> may be located at a position separated from the upstream reference position or downstream reference position by (2m+n)&#xd7;(P<b>2</b>/P<b>1</b>) pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">As described above, the threshold engraving energy is light energy, of light beam required to engrave a surface of a recording medium, and if the energy is smaller than the threshold engraving energy, a recording medium may not be engraved. The threshold engraving energy is a technique that is not disclosed in the prior art, and if this energy is taken into consideration, the plate may be engraved more finely.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Although the light power is controlled upstream and downstream in the horizontal scanning direction in the exemplary embodiment, the light power may be controlled only one of upstream and downstream.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The light power control of the invention may be applied to at least one of upstream and downstream in the vertical scanning direction instead of upstream and downstream in the scanning direction (horizontal scanning direction).</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to the field of probe cover dispensers. More particularly, the invention relates to the field of probe cover dispensers for not exposing the probe cover to touch the body of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The use of ear thermometers is known in the prior art. By way of example, most commercially available ear thermometers are designed to work with disposable probe covers. Most of the disposable probe covers cover the end of the probe and a different probe cover is used for each patient to minimize the risk of spreading disease and also promote cleanliness.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example probe cover dispenser including a tray <b>10</b> designed a block <b>30</b> to accept and dispense a probe cover <b>50</b>. In this example, the probe cover <b>50</b> is inserted into a rectangular tray opening <b>20</b> defined by tray <b>10</b>, with the probe cover <b>50</b> facing downward into the tray.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To attach an individual probe cover <b>50</b> to probe <b>70</b> for insertion of probe cover <b>50</b> into the ear canal of a user, the user may insert probe <b>70</b> into opening <b>20</b>. The user then pushes probe <b>70</b> downwardly into probe cover <b>50</b> deforming and stretching the probe cover <b>50</b> to provide a tight frictional, high surface tension fit between the probe cover and the probe. The advantage of using the dispensing tray <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is that it allows a nurse to very rapidly cover probe <b>70</b> with a probe cover <b>50</b> without having to ever touch or otherwise contact the outer probe cover surface that is to come into contact with the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the aforementioned tray <b>10</b> may expose probe covers <b>50</b> for a long time such that the covers itself become contaminated before use.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a cutaway, perspective view of the dispenser <b>100</b> with a body <b>120</b> is presented. The dispenser has a probe cover chamber <b>140</b> within which the stack of probe covers is stored. At the top of the chamber <b>140</b> is a chamber spring <b>200</b>. The spring <b>200</b> is used to bias the stack of probe covers towards a slide <b>160</b> located at the bottom of the chamber <b>140</b>. The spring <b>200</b> is coupled to a pressure plate <b>180</b> which rests against the top probe cover in the stack. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is the slide <b>220</b> in its relaxed position. Mounted to or formed as part of the slide is a spring block for engaging a slide spring mounted to the body <b>120</b> of the dispenser. The spring biases the slide <b>220</b> into the relaxed position where the aperture <b>240</b> of the slide <b>220</b> lies outside the chamber <b>140</b>. The aperture <b>240</b> is formed into the slide <b>220</b> and its opening and depth are of sizes to accept the probe which the dispenser services.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The described dispenser may not easily to store a probe cover and keep it there to use later by a single hand of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Based on the above, there is a need for medical instrumentation which is uncomplicated in its design and method of operation and which is specifically capable of being used by a single hand.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention overcomes the above-described problems by providing a probe cover dispenser, which includes a storage member for accommodating stacked probe covers and a retaining unit with a pair of supporting arms for holding or releasing one of the stacked probe covers. A slide connects the retaining unit. A linking rod with a protrusion portion and a recess portion connects the slidable access member. The linking rod is moved upwardly or downwardly and the protrusion portion or the recess portion is moved to a position corresponding to the slide such that a force is applied to push or pull the supporting arms to release or hold the one of the stacked probe covers in the storage member, while the slidable access member is moved upwardly or downwardly.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Various aspects of the system and method of the present invention will be described, and for purposes of explanation, specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. Furthermore, well known features have been omitted or simplified in order to prevent obscuring the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a probe cover dispenser <b>300</b> includes a bottom base <b>370</b> with a work platform. A container <b>700</b> on the work platform can be employed to accommodate an ear thermometer <b>500</b>. Further, the bottom base <b>370</b> generally designs a space to accommodate a buffer member <b>314</b> and/or a portion of a linking member <b>400</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A slidable access member <b>310</b> with a first opening <b>312</b> to accommodate a probe cover is disposed on a first position of the bottom base <b>370</b>. A storage member <b>330</b> with a second opening <b>332</b> thereunder disposed on a second position of the bottom base <b>370</b> accommodates stacked probe covers <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A retaining member <b>490</b> holds one of the stacked probe covers such as probe cover <b>334</b><i>a</i>. A linking member <b>400</b> having a first linking end <b>400</b><i>a </i>to connect the slidable access member <b>310</b> and a second linking end <b>400</b><i>b </i>to connect the retaining member <b>490</b>. Specifically, vertically movement of the slidable access member <b>310</b> can induce linking member <b>400</b> for driving retaining member <b>490</b> to release the one of the stacked probe covers <b>334</b><i>a </i>and cause it to fall into the first opening <b>312</b> from the second opening <b>332</b> and/or hold a further one of the stacked probe covers <b>334</b><i>b </i>in the storage member <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first opening <b>312</b> may be disposed under the second opening <b>332</b> or have a distance from the second opening <b>332</b>. In this case, a slide channel <b>350</b> is disposed between the first opening <b>312</b> and the second opening <b>332</b> and thus the one of the stacked probe cover <b>334</b><i>a </i>can fall into the first opening <b>31</b> by way of the slide channel <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one example, a buffer member <b>314</b> can be disposed between the slidable access member <b>310</b> and the bottom base <b>370</b> to allow the slidable access member <b>310</b> to move upwardly and downwardly. In general, the buffer member <b>314</b> may be a spring for connecting the slidable access member <b>310</b> and the bottom base <b>370</b> to form a buffer space.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, retaining member <b>490</b> may include an upper retaining unit <b>492</b> and a lower retaining unit <b>494</b> and Stacked probe covers includes a first probe cover <b>334</b><i>a </i>and a second probe cover <b>334</b><i>b</i>. Specifically, downward movement of the slidable access member <b>310</b> can induce linking member <b>400</b> for driving upper retaining unit <b>492</b> to release the first probe cover <b>334</b><i>a </i>and driving the lower retaining unit <b>494</b> to hold the falling first probe cover <b>334</b><i>a</i>. And upward movement of the slidable access member <b>310</b> can induce linking member <b>400</b> for continuously driving lower retaining unit <b>494</b> to release the first probe cover <b>334</b><i>a </i>and driving the upper retaining unit <b>492</b> to hold a further second probe cover <b>334</b><i>b </i>while the slidable access member <b>310</b> go back to the original position. The first probe cover <b>334</b><i>a </i>then falls into the first opening <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example arrangement, a control button <b>420</b> is located on the side spacer plate of the slidable access member <b>310</b>. Pressing the control button <b>420</b> can move the slidable access member <b>310</b> downwardly and the slidable access member <b>310</b> can be back the original position by the buffer member <b>314</b> while the control button <b>420</b> is released.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the user may directly insert the probe of an ear thermometer <b>500</b> into opening <b>312</b> of the slidable access member <b>310</b>. The user then pushes the probe downwardly into probe cover <b>334</b><i>a </i>to allow the user to very rapidly cover probe with the probe cover <b>334</b><i>a </i>by a single hand without having to ever touch or otherwise contact the outer probe cover surface. The slidable access member <b>310</b> can be back the original position by the buffer member <b>314</b> while the probe is lifted out. Further, the second probe cover <b>334</b><i>b </i>will fall into the opening <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a further embodiment of a linking member <b>400</b> provided in accordance with the present invention. The linking member <b>400</b> may be a pulley system including wheels <b>430</b> each that has a groove between two flanges around its circumference. A cable <b>410</b> usually runs over the wheel <b>430</b> and inside the groove. Pulleys are used to change the direction of an applied force. For example, a linking rod <b>470</b> with a buffer member <b>450</b> such as a spring structure, is designed to connect the cable <b>430</b>. The downward movement of the slidable access member <b>310</b> can pull the cable <b>430</b> and cause the linking rod <b>470</b> to be moved downwardly. Thereafter, the linking rod <b>470</b> will go back to its original position through the buffer member <b>450</b> while the slidable access member <b>310</b> is released.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one example, the linking rod <b>470</b> includes a protrusion portion <b>472</b> and a recess portion <b>474</b>. The downward movement of the linking rod <b>470</b> can move the recess portion <b>474</b> to a position corresponding to the upper retaining unit <b>492</b> causing the upper retaining unit <b>492</b> being pulled back and then releasing the first probe cover <b>334</b><i>a</i>. At the same time, the downward movement of the linking rod <b>470</b> can move the protrusion portion <b>472</b> to a position corresponding to the lower retaining unit <b>494</b> causing the lower retaining unit <b>494</b> being pushed out and then holding the first probe cover <b>334</b><i>a</i>. On the contrary, the upward movement of the linking rod <b>470</b> can move the recess portion <b>474</b> to a position corresponding to the lower retaining unit <b>494</b> causing the lower retaining unit <b>494</b> being pulled back and then releasing the first probe cover <b>334</b><i>a</i>. At the same time, the upward movement of the linking rod <b>470</b> can move the protrusion portion <b>472</b> to a position corresponding to the upper retaining unit <b>492</b> causing the upper retaining unit <b>492</b> being pushed out and then holding the second probe cover <b>334</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a further embodiment of linking rod <b>470</b> provided in accordance with the present invention. The linking rod <b>470</b> may be a camshaft <b>470</b><i>a </i>including a protrusion portion <b>472</b><i>a </i>and a recess portion <b>474</b><i>a</i>. The protrusion portion <b>472</b><i>a </i>and the recess portion <b>474</b><i>a </i>can be moved to the positions corresponding to the upper retaining unit <b>492</b> and the lower retaining unit <b>494</b> while rotational movement of the camshaft <b>470</b><i>a </i>is induced by pulling cable <b>410</b>.</p>

The three-point hitch <b>110</b> includes an engagement member <b>120</b> configured to engage the connecting points <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The connection between the three-point hitch <b>110</b> and the connecting points <b>210</b> is a quick release connection such that the engagement member <b>120</b> engages and disengages the connecting points <b>210</b> without the use of additional hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the illustrated embodiment, the apparatus <b>200</b> includes three connecting points <b>210</b>. In other embodiments, the apparatus includes more or less than three connecting points.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the connecting points <b>210</b> are configured such that the apparatus <b>200</b> remains engaged to the three-point hitch <b>110</b> while the three-point hitch <b>110</b> raises the apparatus <b>200</b> off the ground G. Thus, after the apparatus <b>200</b> has been engaged to the three-point hitch <b>110</b>, the three-point hitch <b>110</b> may raise the apparatus <b>200</b> off the ground G and transfer the weight of the apparatus <b>200</b> to the vehicle <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the apparatus <b>200</b>. The apparatus <b>200</b> includes the connecting points <b>210</b> only one of which, connecting point <b>210</b><i>a</i>, is illustrated. The three-point hitch <b>110</b> of the vehicle <b>100</b> includes two lower arms <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>and one upper arm <b>110</b><i>c</i>. The three-point hitch <b>110</b> also includes the engagement member <b>120</b>. The lower arms <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>can be operated to raise and lower the apparatus <b>200</b>. The upper arm <b>110</b><i>c </i>can be operated to control the tilt of the apparatus <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The apparatus <b>200</b> includes a receptacle <b>220</b>. The receptacle <b>220</b> has six sides three of which, sides <b>230</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this embodiment, the receptacle has the shape of a box or cuboid. In other embodiments, the receptacle may have other shapes with more or less than six sides (e.g. bowl, pyramid, and so on).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the illustrated embodiment, the apparatus <b>200</b> includes six arms <b>240</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>projecting from the receptacle <b>220</b>. The arms <b>240</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>project from the receptacle <b>220</b> substantially horizontally. In some embodiments (not shown), the apparatus may include less than six arms operably connected to the receptacle. In other embodiments (not shown), the apparatus may include more than six arms operably connected to the receptacle. In one embodiment (not shown), the apparatus includes four arms projecting from the receptacle. In some embodiments, the arms may project from the receptacle in configurations other than substantially horizontally.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the illustrated embodiment, the arms <b>240</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>are configured to receive the weights <b>250</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. The weights <b>250</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are suitcase weights. As it is known in the art, suitcase weights are weights that include a handle for convenience of handling. In the illustrated embodiment, the arms <b>240</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>have an L-shaped cross section for receiving the suitcase weights <b>250</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. In other embodiments (not shown), the arms may be configured to receive weights other than suitcase weights (barbells, disc weights, plates, and so on).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the arms are configured to receive a plurality of weights totaling at least 1,800 pounds (816.5 kg). In another embodiment, the arms are configured to receive a plurality of weights totaling at least 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg). In other embodiments, the arms are configured to receive a plurality of weights totaling less than 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg). In yet another embodiment, the arms are configured to each receive at least ten suitcase weights. In alternative embodiments, the arms are configured to each receive less than ten suitcase weights.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exploded view of the apparatus <b>200</b> for adding weight to a work vehicle. The receptacle <b>220</b> includes a removable side <b>230</b><i>a</i>. The removable side <b>230</b><i>a </i>may be removed from the receptacle <b>220</b> so that material (not shown) for adding weight to the receptacle <b>220</b> may be received into the inside of the receptacle <b>220</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the removable side <b>230</b><i>a </i>is the top side or lid. In another embodiment, a removable side may be sides other than the top.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the receptacle is configured to receive material totaling at least 4,000 pounds (1,814 kg) of added weight. In other embodiments, the receptacle may be configured to receive material totaling less than 4,000 pounds (1,814 kg) of added weight. Material to be added inside the receptacle may include lead, concrete, gravel, steel, water, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other embodiments, the receptacle does not include a removable side. For example, the receptacle may have a permanent opening through which material may be added. In another example, one side may be hingedly connected to the rest of the receptacle and thus the one side may be opened to expose an opening through which material may be added.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the illustrated embodiment, the arms <b>240</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>are portions of three members <b>260</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. For example, the arms <b>240</b><i>a </i>and <b>240</b><i>b </i>are portions of the member <b>260</b><i>a</i>. A first portion of the member <b>260</b><i>a</i>, the arm <b>240</b><i>a</i>, protrudes through an opening on the side <b>230</b><i>c </i>of the receptacle <b>220</b>. A second portion of the member <b>260</b><i>a</i>, the arm <b>240</b><i>b</i>, protrudes through openings on another side <b>230</b><i>d </i>of the receptacle <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the illustrated embodiment, the members <b>260</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are operably connected to the receptacle <b>220</b> by welding joints. In other embodiments (not shown), the arms or the members are operably connected to the receptacle by other means known in the art (e.g. fasteners, adhesives, interference fit, and so on). In one embodiment (not shown), the arms or the members are part of a unitary structure with the receptacle (e.g. a molded structure and so on).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the members <b>260</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are shaped to receive weights such as the weight <b>250</b><i>a</i>. In the embodiment, the member <b>260</b><i>b</i>, and thus the arm <b>240</b><i>c</i>, has a substantially L-shape along its longitudinal axis such that the member <b>260</b><i>b</i>, and thus the arm <b>240</b><i>c</i>, may receive suitcase weights such as the suitcase weight <b>250</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To the extent that the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; or &#x201c;including&#x201d; is used in the specification or the claims, it is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; as that term is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim. Furthermore, to the extent that the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is employed (e.g., A or B) it is intended to mean &#x201c;A or B or both.&#x201d; When the applicants intend to indicate &#x201c;only A or B but not both&#x201d; then the term &#x201c;only A or B but not both&#x201d; will be employed. Thus, use of the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; herein is the inclusive, and not the exclusive use. See, Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 624 (2d. Ed. 1995).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Also, to the extent that the terms &#x201c;in&#x201d; or &#x201c;into&#x201d; are used in the specification or the claims, it is intended to additionally mean &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;onto.&#x201d; Furthermore, to the extent the term &#x201c;connect&#x201d; is used in the specification or claims, it is intended to mean not only &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; but also &#x201c;indirectly connected to&#x201d; such as connected through another component or components. An &#x201c;operable connection,&#x201d; or a connection by which components are &#x201c;operably connected,&#x201d; is one by which the operably connected components or the operable connection perform its intended purpose. For example, two components may be operably connected to each other directly or through one or more intermediate components.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A lever in a lever type connector which is attached to a first housing, is rotated to fit the first housing to a second housing, and has a pair of side walls and an operation potion connecting the side walls. Locking arms are provided on the side walls so as to project toward an opening of the first housing into which the second housing is fitted. Temporary locking releasing portions are provided in the first housing. The locking arms are deformed into a state that a part of each of the locking arms is disposed on each of the temporary locking releasing portions, so that the lever is elastically deformed, when the lever is rotated. Each of the temporary locking releasing portions has an inclined face on which each of the locking arms is moved in a direction which the lever is elastically restored after the locking arms are deformed by the temporary locking releasing portions.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Japanese Patent Publication No. 2002-359028 A discloses a lever type connector, which includes, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a male housing <b>501</b>, a lever <b>503</b> rotatable with respect to the male housing <b>501</b>, a connecting portion <b>505</b> for connecting the lever <b>503</b> to the male housing <b>501</b>, and a female housing <b>507</b> in which the male housing <b>501</b> is fitted for accommodation therein. The connecting portion <b>505</b> includes a projecting portion <b>509</b> which is provided on the male housing <b>501</b> and an engagement hole <b>511</b> which is provided in the lever <b>503</b> so as to be brought into engagement with the projecting portion <b>509</b> and which is formed to extend long towards one side of the lever <b>503</b> with respect to the projecting portion <b>509</b>. The lever <b>503</b> is allowed to be displaced to an opposite position to a fitting position in such a state that the male and female housings <b>501</b>, <b>507</b> are fitted together in a normal condition.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In this lever type connector <b>500</b>, the lever <b>503</b> is displaced to the other side of the lever <b>503</b> to the fitting position where the male and female housings are fitted together in the normal condition. This configuration solves the problem inherent in a conventional lever type connector that the force pressing down directly the male housing <b>501</b> lacks a force corresponding to the component force acting in a direction which intersects the male housing <b>501</b> in the vertical direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The conventional lever type connector disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2002-359028 A solves the problem that the force pressing downwards directly the male housing lacks the component force acting in the vertical direction and manages to increase the workability in fitting the male and female housing together. However, while the reduction in size and weight still continues to be demanded for this type of lever type connectors, there is a high demand for a further reduction in insertion force.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to the conventional example described above, Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-3059A discloses a lever type connector. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, this lever type connector <b>520</b> includes a lever member <b>523</b> and an elastic lock member <b>531</b>. The lever member <b>523</b> is supported rotatably on a female connector part. The elastic lock member <b>531</b> has a spring lock portion <b>525</b>, lock releasing portions <b>527</b> and elastic engagement portions <b>529</b>. The elastic lock member <b>531</b> is assembled along the lever member <b>523</b> and biases the lever member <b>523</b> in a lock releasing direction. In an initial fitting stage of two connector parts, cam pins <b>535</b> are brought into engagement with corresponding cam grooves <b>533</b>. In a final fitting stage of both the two connector parts by the rotation of the lever member <b>523</b>, the spring lock portion <b>525</b> is brought into engagement with the lock portion <b>537</b>. In an intermediate fitting stage of the two connector parts, the elastic engagement portions <b>529</b> of the elastic lock member <b>531</b> ride over corresponding angular spring guides <b>539</b> to thereby reduce the fitting load by making use of a restoring force generated in the elastic engagement portions <b>529</b> when the elastic engagement portions <b>529</b> ride over the spring guides <b>539</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in order to make use of the restoring force generated in the elastic engagement portions <b>529</b>, the separate elastic lock member <b>531</b> has to be installed on the lever member <b>523</b>, which is disadvantageous in reducing the size and weight of the lever type connector.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore one advantageous aspect of the present invention to provide a lever type connector which is advantageous in reducing the size and weight thereof and which can realize a reduction in insertion force.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one advantage of the invention, there is provided a lever type connector comprising;</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">a first housing;</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a second housing;</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a lever, attached to the first housing, configured to be rotated to fit the first housing to the second housing, and having a pair of side walls and an operation potion connecting the side walls;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">locking arms, provided on the side walls so as to project toward an opening of the first housing into which the second housing is fitted; and</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">temporary locking releasing portions, provided in the first housing;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">wherein the locking arms are deformed into a state that a part of each of the locking arms is disposed on each of the temporary locking releasing portions, so that the lever is elastically deformed, when the lever is rotated, and</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">wherein each of the temporary locking releasing portions has an inclined face on which each of the locking arms is moved in a direction which the lever is elastically restored after the locking arms are deformed by the temporary locking releasing portions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The lever type connector may further comprise temporary locking projections, provided in the second housing. The locking arms may be engaged to the temporary locking projections so that the lever is prevented from being rotated so as to be held at temporary locking positions.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The lock arms may be deformed in a direction in which the pair of the side walls are spaced away from each other.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the invention will be described by reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exploded perspective view of a lever type connector according to the invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view of a female connector part on which a lever is installed, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a front view of a male connector part showing a fitting opening portion, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view taken along the line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A lever type connector <b>11</b> includes a male housing <b>13</b> which is a first housing, a female housing <b>15</b> which is a second housing which is fitted in the male housing <b>13</b> to be accommodated therein, a lever <b>17</b> which is rotatably installed on the female housing <b>15</b> and a connecting portion <b>19</b> for connecting the lever <b>17</b> to the female housing <b>15</b>. In this embodiment, although the first housing is the male housing <b>13</b> and the second housing is the female housing <b>15</b>, the lever type connector <b>11</b> may be such that the first housing is the female housing <b>15</b> and the second housing is the male housing <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the lever type connector <b>11</b>, the lever <b>17</b> which is to be brought into engagement with the male housing <b>13</b> is installed rotatably on the female housing <b>15</b>, and when the male housing <b>13</b> and the female housing <b>15</b> are inserted one in the other so as to be fitted together, the lever <b>17</b> is rotated so as to reduce an inserting force by making use of leverage generated by the lever <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The female housing <b>15</b> has a plurality of terminal accommodation compartments <b>21</b> in which female terminals are accommodated individually. A pair of projecting portions <b>25</b> are provided on each of both larger side surfaces <b>23</b> of the female housing <b>15</b> so as to project therefrom. In addition, guide ribs <b>27</b> are formed individually at one end sides of both the side surfaces <b>23</b> in a longitudinal direction so as to project from the corresponding side surfaces <b>23</b> along a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The lever <b>17</b> includes a pair of side walls <b>29</b> which are disposed so as to face each other with both the side faces <b>23</b> of the female housing <b>15</b> held therebetween and an operating portion <b>31</b> which connects together one end sides of the side walls <b>29</b> in a longitudinal direction. A pair of engagement holes <b>33</b> are provided on each of the side walls <b>29</b> so as to be brought into engagement with the corresponding pair of projecting portions <b>25</b> on each of the side surfaces of the female housing <b>15</b>. An engagement projection <b>35</b> is provided on each of the side walls <b>29</b> at an opposite side to the side which is connected by the operating portion <b>31</b> across the engagement holes <b>33</b>. This engagement projection <b>35</b> is locked on a locking step portion <b>37</b> formed in an interior of the male housing <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The connecting portion <b>19</b> is made up of the projecting portions <b>25</b> formed on the female housing <b>15</b> and the engagement holes <b>33</b> provided in the lever <b>17</b>. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the connecting portion <b>19</b> is configured so that the projecting portions <b>25</b> and the engagement holes <b>33</b> are brought into engagement with each other and the side walls <b>29</b> of the lever <b>17</b> are connected to the female housing <b>15</b>, so that the lever <b>17</b> is allowed to rotate about the projecting portions <b>25</b> as an rotational axis.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The male housing <b>13</b> has a hood portion <b>39</b> into which the female housing <b>15</b> is fitted. This hood portion <b>39</b> has engagement grooves <b>41</b> which are provided on an inner circumferential surface in positions which correspond to the engagement projections <b>35</b> on the lever <b>17</b> so as to extend along the vertical direction. The engagement grooves <b>41</b> in the hood portion <b>39</b> have the locking step portions <b>37</b> with which the engagement projections <b>35</b> are brought into engagement and which constitute fulcrums together with the engagement projections <b>35</b> when the lever <b>17</b> rotates. In addition, the hood portion <b>39</b> has guide grooves <b>45</b> which are formed in the inner circumferential surface in positions which correspond to the guide ribs <b>27</b> on the female housing <b>15</b> so that the guide ribs <b>27</b> are inserted thereinto. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the hood portion <b>39</b> has a plurality of mating terminals <b>47</b> which are provided on a bottom surface <b>49</b> so as to project therefrom for connection to the terminals of the female housing <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Incidentally, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, locking arms <b>53</b> are provided on the side walls <b>29</b> of the lever <b>17</b> so as to project towards the fitting opening portion <b>51</b> in the male housing <b>13</b>. The locking arm <b>53</b> is made up of a strip piece portion <b>55</b> and a projecting piece portion <b>59</b> which projects from one side portion <b>57</b> of the strip piece portion <b>55</b>. Temporary locking projections <b>61</b> are provided on the female housing <b>15</b> which prevent the rotation of the lever <b>17</b> and hold the lever <b>17</b> in a temporary locking position. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the locking arm <b>53</b> temporarily locks the lever <b>17</b> by causing the strip piece portion <b>55</b> to be locked on the temporary locking projection <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a pair of temporary locking releasing portions <b>63</b> are provided within the hood portion <b>39</b> of the male housing <b>13</b> on which the locking arms <b>53</b> ride while elastically deforming the lever <b>17</b> when the lever <b>17</b> rotates. Inclined surfaces <b>65</b> are formed on the temporary locking releasing portions <b>63</b>. The inclined surfaces <b>65</b> allow the locking arms <b>53</b> to slide downwards therealong in a direction in which the lever <b>17</b> is elastically restored when the lever <b>17</b> rotates to such an extent to trigger an inserting force reducing operation. Gap portions <b>67</b> are defined between the temporary locking releasing portions <b>63</b> and the hood portion <b>39</b> so that the locking arms <b>53</b> enter them. Consequently, when the locking arms <b>53</b> ride on the temporary locking releasing portions <b>63</b>, the lever <b>17</b> is elastically deformed in a direction in which the pair of side walls <b>29</b> are spaced away from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, the function of the lever type connector <b>11</b> will be described which is configured as has been described above.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5D</figref> are operation explanatory diagrams showing fitting stages of the lever type connector <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref> are operation explanatory diagrams showing the fitting stages at a portion taken along the line B-B and seen in a direction indicated by arrows B, B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are operation explanatory diagrams showing the fitting stages at a portion taken along the line C-C and seen in a direction indicated by arrows C, C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in the lever type connector <b>11</b>, the female housing <b>15</b> on which the lever <b>17</b> is installed is fitted into the male housing <b>13</b>. As this occurs, the locking arms <b>53</b> are brought into abutment with the temporary locking projections <b>61</b> as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, whereby the lever <b>17</b> is prevented from rotating further.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the female housing <b>15</b> and the male housing <b>13</b> are fitted together, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the engagement projections <b>35</b> of the lever <b>17</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are brought into engagement with the locking step portions <b>37</b> of the engagement grooves <b>41</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the male housing <b>13</b> so as to make them function as fulcrums. Then, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the operating portion <b>31</b> of the lever <b>17</b> is pressed so as to rotate the lever <b>17</b> in the fitting direction of the female housing <b>15</b> and the male housing <b>13</b>. As this occurs, a force is exerted on the projecting portions <b>25</b> by leverage generated in the lever <b>17</b> rotated and the pressing force which presses against the operating portion <b>31</b> so as to press downwards directly the female housing <b>15</b>, whereby the female housing <b>15</b> shifts in whole in the fitting direction. As a result, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the female housing <b>15</b> is fitted in the hood portion <b>39</b> of the male housing <b>13</b>. In this state, the lever <b>17</b> is accommodated in the hood portion <b>39</b> of the male housing <b>13</b> together with the female housing <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Incidentally, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, when the male housing <b>13</b> and the female housing <b>15</b> start to be fitted together, the locking arms <b>53</b> of the lever <b>17</b> which is installed on the female housing <b>15</b> are brought into abutment with the temporary locking releasing portions <b>63</b> of the male housing <b>13</b>. In the locking arms <b>53</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, although a distal end of the strip piece portion <b>55</b> is in abutment with the temporary locking projection <b>61</b>, the projecting piece portion <b>59</b> which projects from the one side portion <b>57</b> of the strip piece portion <b>55</b> is brought into abutment with the temporary locking releasing portion <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the lever <b>17</b> is rotated in the operating direction, as is indicated by double-dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the locking arms <b>53</b> ride on the temporary locking releasing portions <b>63</b>, and the lever <b>17</b> is elastically deformed correspondingly to the riding of the locking arms <b>53</b> on the temporary locking releasing portions <b>63</b>. The locking arms <b>53</b> release the locking of the strip piece portions <b>55</b> with the temporary locking projections <b>63</b> as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> by the deformation produced when the projecting piece portions <b>59</b> ride on the temporary locking releasing portions <b>63</b>. Namely, the pushing biasing force of the lever <b>17</b> is designed to be obtained by making effective use of the temporary locking construction which temporarily locks and releases the lever <b>17</b>. In addition, in this embodiment, the elastic deformation of the lever which generates the pushing biasing force of the lever <b>17</b> is the deformation in the direction in which the pair of side walls <b>29</b> are spaced away from each other. By this configuration, the locking of the locking arms <b>53</b> on the temporary locking projections <b>61</b> can be released at the same time as the deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, when the lever <b>17</b> rotates further in the operating direction, the locking arms <b>53</b> which are now on the temporary locking releasing portions <b>63</b> reach the inclined surfaces <b>65</b> thereof. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the locking arms <b>53</b> slide downwards along the inclined surfaces <b>65</b> by an elastic restoring force of the lever <b>17</b>. As this occurs, at the same time as this, the strip piece portions <b>55</b> also ride over the temporary locking projections <b>61</b> completely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. In this way, the locking arms <b>53</b> are pressed against the inclined surfaces <b>65</b> by the restoring force of the pair of side walls <b>29</b> of the lever <b>17</b> which are spaced away from each other. This pressing force is divided into a vertical reaction force from the inclined surfaces <b>65</b> which are received by the locking arms <b>53</b> and a component force in the sliding direction along the inclined surfaces <b>65</b>. The component force constitutes an assisting force F which biases the lever <b>17</b> in the pushing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Consequently, according to the lever type connector <b>11</b> of the embodiment, the locking arms <b>53</b> are provided on the lever <b>17</b>, and the temporary locking releasing portions <b>63</b> are provided in the first housing <b>13</b>. Then, when the locking arms <b>53</b> ride over the temporary locking releasing portions <b>63</b>, the lever <b>17</b> is elastically deformed, and the elastic restoring force generated then can be made to contribute to the thrust force in the pushing direction of the lever <b>17</b>. As a result, the lever type connector <b>11</b> can be obtained which is advantageous in reducing the size and weight and which can realize the reduction in inserting force.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Note that the lever type connector of the invention is not limited to the embodiment but can be modified or improved as required. In addition, the material, shape and dimensions of the lever type connector of the invention are arbitrary and are not limited to those described in the embodiment, provided that the object of the invention can be attained with them.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Display screens and other monitors are used to provide images. Certain types of three dimensional displays (also known as 3-D displays and stereoscopic displays) require two display panels. The display panels can be liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, organic light emitting diode (OLED) panels, or other types of display panels.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The display panels are generally laminated together with liquid adhesives or held together in a metal or plastic frame with an air gap between the panels. Relative positional control between the LCD panels is limited to the accuracy of the scribe and break accuracy of the two panels. Inaccuracy in placing the panels with respect to each other can produce a ghosting or other degradation of the 3-D image and otherwise adversely affect image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Inaccuracy in placing the panels with respect to each other may also affect the maximum luminance of the 3-D image. A typical RGB pixel includes red, green, and blue elements arranged next to each other. Misaligned panels may have, for instance, red elements on one panel that partially or completely overlay blue or green elements on the other panel. Alternatively, misaligned panels may cause a pixel element to be partially obscured by structure (e.g., pixel border) associated with the other panel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a need for a system and method for aligning display panels such as liquid crystal display panels (i.e., LCD panels). Further, there is a need for accurately positioned and laminated LCD panels for creating realistic three dimensional images. Further still, there is a need for a method of aligning display panels at a better accuracy (e.g., better than 0.05 millimeters for a 10.4 inch VGA panel with a 640&#xd7;480 resolution and a pixel pitch of 330 microns&#xd7;330 microns). Yet further, there is a need for a method and apparatus for ensuring that LCD panels are not misaligned to the point of unacceptable luminance or picture degradation (e.g., more than 0.2 millimeters for striped pixel elements). Further, there is a need for a system for aligning display panels with striped pixel elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An exemplary embodiment relates to a method of attaching a first display element and a second display element. The method includes providing the first display panel on a first stage and providing a second display element on a second stage. A position of the second display element is adjustable relative to the first display element in at least two dimensions. The method also includes disposing the first display element above the second display element, aligning the first display element with respect to the second display element using at least one optical device, and adhering the first display element to the second display element.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another exemplary embodiment relates to an apparatus for aligning a first display panel and a second display panel. The apparatus includes a first stage for supporting the first display panel, a second stage for supporting the second display panel, and a system for viewing or sensing alignment of the first display panel and the second display panel.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>, an alignment system <b>10</b> according to one exemplary embodiment can be executed to align a display panel or element <b>44</b> and a display panel or element <b>46</b>. Alignment system <b>10</b> may comprise a vacuum chamber <b>50</b>. Use of vacuum chamber <b>50</b> can shorten the process. Alternatively, system <b>10</b> can be provided without a vacuum chamber <b>50</b> and may be provided in a chamber or an area at normal atmospheric pressure. Final lamination of elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> with vacuum may be done with a process as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,592,288, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Vacuum chamber <b>50</b> may be any container which is capable of being sealed so as to separate a space interior to the vacuum chamber <b>50</b> from a space exterior to the vacuum chamber <b>50</b>. For example, the vacuum chamber <b>50</b> may be a generally rectangular structure having a vacuum chamber body and a vacuum chamber lid. Vacuum chamber <b>50</b> may be constructed of any number of materials having sufficient strength so as to maintain a vacuum such as aluminum, steel, carbon fiber, plastics, and the like. The vacuum level in vacuum chamber <b>50</b> may be determined such that chamber <b>50</b> has sufficient holding power without disturbing the display cell gap.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">System <b>10</b> preferably includes a stage <b>24</b>, a stage <b>26</b> and an optical system <b>52</b>. Preferably, stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are disposed side by side with respect to each other. Stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> can be model <b>271</b> lab jack type stages manufactured by Newport. According to other exemplary embodiments, stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> may be motorized and automated.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, display element <b>44</b> is provided on a surface or panel <b>64</b> associated with stage <b>24</b>. Display element <b>46</b> is provided on a surface or panel <b>66</b> associated with stage <b>26</b>. Panels <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> support display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. Panel <b>66</b> can be similar to panel <b>64</b>. Panel <b>64</b> and panel <b>66</b> can be provided of any material, such as plastic. Preferably, panel <b>64</b> and panel <b>66</b> are translucent. In one embodiment, panel <b>64</b> and panel <b>66</b> can have an orange translucent color, can be clear or can have another translucent color.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Alternatively, in other embodiments, panel <b>64</b> and panel <b>66</b> may be another rigid material, such as a polymer or metal. Panels <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> are preferably formed from an anti-static material or are provided with an anti-static coating to prevent electro-static damage to sensitive electrical devices and components (e.g., LCDs, etc.). If panels <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> are not formed from a translucent material, fiducial viewing openings can be provided in panels <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>, such as with a machining process.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, system <b>10</b> and display element <b>44</b> are in a load position in which display element <b>44</b> is placed on display element <b>46</b> and rough adjustments are made to the alignment of display element <b>44</b> (and panel <b>64</b>) with respect to display element <b>46</b> (and panel <b>66</b>). Three or more indexing pins can be used for coarse alignment of display element <b>44</b> and display element <b>46</b>, with display element <b>44</b> being oriented face down and display element <b>46</b> being oriented face up.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, system <b>10</b> is in an alignment position in which display <b>44</b> is provided above display element <b>46</b>. System <b>10</b> can utilize a hinge <b>65</b> to effect operation from the load position to the alignment position. Hinge <b>65</b> couples panel <b>64</b> to a table or surface <b>28</b> that is supported by stage <b>24</b>. Alternatively, other coupling methods and mechanisms between panel <b>64</b> and stage <b>24</b> can be used to effect transition between the load position and the alignment position.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> can be LCD display panels, OLED panels, or other displays, assemblies, or devices for use in display systems. In one embodiment, elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are LCD panels utilized in three dimensional displays requiring high accuracy placement. Display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are preferably planar, rectangular panels. Other shapes for elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Display element <b>44</b> is preferably held against surface <b>64</b> via a vacuum connection <b>90</b>. Once in the alignment position, stage <b>24</b> is utilized to adjust the position of display element <b>44</b> and stage <b>26</b> can be utilized to adjust the position of display element <b>46</b> to provide accurate positioning of element <b>44</b> with respect to element <b>46</b>. Alternatively, only one stage is required to be moved such that one of elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> is adjusted with respect to the other of elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. Typically, stage <b>26</b> is set and not moved until final contact is desired. Stage <b>24</b> and screw <b>94</b> are used to move display element <b>44</b> close to display <b>46</b> (e.g., less than 0.03 inches) and parallel to display <b>46</b>. Adjustments to the X, Y, and theta positions of stage <b>24</b> are made to align display element <b>44</b> over display element <b>46</b>. Display element <b>46</b> may then be lifted to make contact with display element <b>44</b>, as lowering display element <b>44</b> to make contact with display element <b>46</b> would change the angle of orientation of display element <b>44</b> such that it was no longer parallel with display element <b>46</b>. Relative positions of display element <b>44</b> and display element <b>46</b> may be monitored using optical system <b>52</b> while display element <b>46</b> is being lifted into place.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An adjustment screw <b>94</b> or other similar device is coupled to surface <b>64</b>. Once display <b>44</b> is moved into an alignment position, adjustment screw <b>64</b> may be used to further set the position of display <b>44</b> parallel relative to display <b>46</b>. Adjustment screw <b>94</b> may be turned such that the end of the screw <b>94</b> advances from or is withdrawn closer to surface <b>64</b> and contacts a rigid component such as a magnet rail <b>80</b>. The position of adjustment screw <b>94</b> (e.g., the distance of the top of screw <b>94</b> relative to surface <b>64</b>) may be set by turning screw <b>94</b> to align display <b>44</b> parallel to display <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">System <b>10</b> may further include a rotary stage <b>86</b> to position display <b>44</b> relative to display <b>46</b>. Rotary stage <b>86</b> is coupled to stage <b>24</b> with a rotary adapter plate <b>88</b>. Rotary stage <b>86</b> may be a Parker Hannifin 30005P stage or another suitable manual or automated stage.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Optical system <b>52</b> is preferably configured to provide a user an indication of the position of displays <b>44</b> and display <b>46</b>. Optical system <b>52</b> can include cameras, scopes, or other devices for determining the position of display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. According to one embodiment, optical system <b>52</b> includes a camera <b>60</b>, an objective lens <b>61</b>, a video microscope lens <b>62</b>, and an iris lens <b>63</b>. Optical system <b>52</b> allows fiducials or individual pixel elements to be viewed or sensed. In an alternative embodiment, optical system <b>52</b> is a microscope, a viewer or the other components that sense the alignment of elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Optical system <b>52</b> may be coupled to stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> for providing an automatic adjustment. Alternatively, an automatic adjustment circuit or manual adjustment can be utilized to adjust the position of display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> on stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, in one embodiment, the position of the optical system <b>52</b> is controlled with a coarse y-axis adjustment device <b>54</b>, a coarse x-axis adjustment device <b>56</b>, and a fine x-axis and y-axis adjustment device <b>58</b>. Y-axis adjustment device <b>54</b> moves along a horizontal rail <b>53</b> that is supported by vertical rails <b>55</b>. X-adjustment device <b>56</b> moves along a horizontal rail <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Alternatively, optical system <b>52</b> can be a location system that relies on mechanical or electronic components to sense a position of elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> on stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. According to one exemplary embodiment, a light sensor may be used to sense the luminance through display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> that are backlit (e.g., by a backlight coupled to magnet rail <b>80</b>). The light sensor may be oriented similar to optical system <b>52</b>, perpendicular to display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. By making fine adjustments to the relative positions of display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, the pixels of display panels <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> may be aligned (e.g., aligning the red elements of the pixels of display panel <b>44</b> with those of panel <b>46</b>, the green elements of display element <b>44</b> with those of panel <b>46</b>, and the blue elements of display element <b>44</b> with those of <b>46</b>). As panels <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> become more aligned, more light reaches the light sensor. When a maximum amount of light is sensed by the light sensor, maximum alignment is achieved. In this way, monitoring the output of the light source with the sensor can be used to determine when alignment is achieved. The light can be a monochrome light, white light, laser light, etc. In one embodiment, a red, green, or blue light is utilized to ensure that only light from one color pixel element is received by the light sensor. In another embodiment, red, green, and blue light is provided successively.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are preferably adjustable in a number of dimensions. In one preferred embodiment, stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are each adjustable in the Z axis, the X axis, the Y axis. In addition, in a preferred embodiment stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> can also be adjusted for tilt about the X and Y axis and for rotations above the Z axis. System <b>10</b> may further include an additional stage <b>87</b> for making adjustments along the x-axis and an additional stage <b>89</b> for making adjustments along the y-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Panel <b>66</b> is supported by one or more spacer rails <b>68</b> arranged on a platform <b>69</b> that is coupled to stage <b>26</b>. Spacer rails <b>68</b> can be more rigidly supported by platform <b>69</b> than if they were supported directly by stage <b>26</b>. The positions of spacer rails <b>68</b> on platform <b>69</b> may be adjusted to improve weight distribution and to make coarse adjustments of display element <b>46</b> along the x-axis and the y-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, display element <b>44</b> includes at least one fiducial mark <b>74</b> and display element <b>46</b> includes at least one fiducial mark <b>76</b>. Fiducial marks can be any shape and can be fiducial marks associated with the manufacture of elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> (e.g., type fiducial marks). In such an embodiment, additional alignment markings are not required to be placed on elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. Although crosses are shown as fiducial marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>, any shape is possible, including circular, square, oval, combinations thereof, etc. Fiducial marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> may be positive features (e.g., a colored or shaded mark on a clear background) or negative features (e.g., a clear mark on a colored or shaded background).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Fiducial marks <b>74</b> are <b>76</b> are visible to optical system <b>52</b> through transparent surfaces <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> or through openings in surfaces <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>. Optical system <b>52</b> is utilized to ensure that fiducial marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are placed above each other to ensure proper alignment. For example, fiducial marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> should be aligned to be directly over each other and that offset is not noticed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The adjustment can be made automatically utilizing positioning software and a computer for adjusting the position of stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. The computer, via execution of software, can adjust the position of stage <b>24</b> and stage <b>26</b> until marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are directly above each other. Image processing software can be utilized to determine if marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are offset from each other and make appropriate adjustments until marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are aligned. Alternatively, an operator can view the position of fiducial marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> through optical system <b>52</b> and manually adjust the position of at least one of stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> to position displays <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> accurately above each other. In a manual system, an operator may use, for example, a monitor displaying images from a camera or a direct view microscope. As described above, a light source and a light sensor may be used to precisely align display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> by measuring the luminance through the display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a preferred embodiment, optical system <b>52</b> includes at least 2 cameras positioned perpendicular to elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. The image of each element <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> from each camera in optical system <b>52</b> is displayed side by side so that corrections can be made with respect to the position of displays <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> using stages <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, each of elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> includes at least one of fiducial mark <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>, respectively. Preferably, fiducial marks are provided at different places on elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> (e.g., on opposite or diagonally opposed corners) to ensure proper alignment. Fiducial marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> can be etched, printed, stained, cut, molded, stamped, or otherwise marked upon elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An LED backlight or other light source may be positioned under at least fiducial marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. A backlight increases the visibility of fiducial marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> and increases the ease with which display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> may be aligned. According to an exemplary embodiment, the backlight includes a magnet LED holder <b>82</b>. Magnetic LED holder <b>82</b> is coupled to a magnet rail <b>80</b> that is supported by a magnet rail support <b>84</b>. Magnetic LED holder <b>82</b> may be repositioned on magnet rail <b>80</b> to provide backlight at various places behind display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. Further, magnet LED holder <b>82</b>, magnet rail <b>80</b>, and magnet rail support <b>84</b> provide a heat sink for the backlight.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An LCD board support <b>96</b> may be provided to support the LCD driver board and position it so that it does not obscure the line of sight between optical system <b>52</b> and fiducial marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a process <b>100</b> allows elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> to be aligned accurately to reduce image degradation and increase luminance in 3-D displays. In a step <b>102</b>, display element <b>44</b> on stage <b>24</b> is roughly aligned with respect to display element <b>46</b> on stage <b>26</b> in the load position. Display element <b>46</b> may also be roughly adjusted using stage <b>26</b> and positioning spacer rails <b>68</b>. Process <b>100</b> can utilize system <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>). At a step <b>104</b>, display element <b>44</b> is disposed above display element <b>46</b>. In a step <b>106</b>, display element <b>44</b> is aligned above display element <b>46</b>. Preferably, elements are aligned such that errors are less than 0.20 millimeters in any axis. In a most preferred embodiment, accuracy of better than 0.05 millimeters is achieved. In a step <b>108</b>, element <b>44</b> is adhered (e.g., tack adhered) to element <b>46</b>. Alignment can be achieved by first coarse aligning panels <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> using manual adjustment and optical/mechanical tools. After coarse alignment, finer alignments can be achieved using manual or automated processes. Alternatively, the entire alignment operation can be automated using electronic sensors and controls. In a step <b>110</b>, elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are laminated together. In one exemplary embodiment, dry film vacuum lamination may be used. According to other exemplary embodiments, any other suitable technique can be used to attach or adhere element <b>44</b> to element <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Preferably, a small parallel gap is provided in step <b>104</b> such that fiducial alignment marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are both in focus at the same time of optical system <b>52</b>. Alternatively, fiducial alignment marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> are not utilized and select pixel elements on each of display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are utilized. In such an embodiment, a small parallel gap between elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> is relatively small or minimized and controlled closely such that the pixel elements of each display are both in focus at the same time. Preferably, at least two cameras are positioned perpendicular to elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> thereby allowing elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> to be positioned accurately and stable enough to view fiducial marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> and/or the pixel elements. The alignment marks <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> or pixel elements can be viewed on a microscope, monitor, screen or other display. The pixel elements can be monochrome or color elements.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Preferably, the clear pressure sensitive adhesive is provided above display element <b>46</b> in the load position. Once displays <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are positioned with respect to each other using optical system <b>52</b>, elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> can be temporarily held together with an optically clear pressure sensitive adhesive placed on the top surface of <b>46</b> until vacuum laminated by a process such as the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,592,288. Elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are temporarily held together by closing the gap between elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> until the adhesive is engaged. Preferably, alignment accuracy of better than 0.05 millimeters is obtained for a 10.4 inch VGA panel with 640&#xd7;480 resolution and a pixel pitch 330&#xd7;330 microns. In another preferred embodiment, alignment accuracy of better than 0.2 millimeters for a panel with striped pixel elements is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a process <b>120</b> allows elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> to be aligned accurately with the use of an optical sensor to reduce image degradation and increase luminance in 3-D displays. Process <b>120</b> may be performed with system <b>10</b>. In a step <b>122</b>, display element <b>44</b> on stage <b>24</b> is roughly aligned with respect to display element <b>46</b> on stage <b>26</b> in the load position. Display element <b>46</b> may also be roughly adjusted using stage <b>26</b> and positioning spacer rails <b>68</b>. At a step <b>124</b>, display element <b>44</b> is disposed above display element <b>46</b>. In a step <b>126</b>, the alignment of display element <b>44</b> above display element <b>46</b> is checked such as by unaided visual inspection.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a step <b>128</b>, display element <b>44</b> is finely aligned with respect to display element <b>46</b>. Preferably, at least one optical sensor (e.g., light sensor) is positioned perpendicular to elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> opposite of a light source (e.g., backlight) provided on the opposite side of elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. The optical sensor is used to sense the luminance through backlit display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>. By making fine adjustments to the relative positions of display elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, the pixels of display panels <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> may be aligned (e.g., aligning the red elements of the pixels of display panel <b>44</b> with those of panel <b>46</b>, the green elements of display element <b>44</b> with those of panel <b>46</b>, and the blue elements of display element <b>44</b> with those of <b>46</b>). In a step <b>130</b>, the luminance of the light passing though displays <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are checked by sensing the luminance. In a step <b>132</b>, the luminance sensed in step <b>130</b> is checked against a previous value and the position of display element <b>44</b> is fine adjusted more until the pixel elements are aligned and the luminance is maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a step <b>134</b>, display element <b>44</b> is adhered to display element <b>46</b>. Preferably, a clear pressure sensitive adhesive is provided above display element <b>46</b> in the load position. Once displays <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are positioned with respect to each other using optical system <b>52</b>, elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> can be temporarily held together with an optically clear pressure sensitive adhesive placed on the top surface of <b>46</b> until vacuum laminated by a process such as the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,592,288. Elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are temporarily held together by closing the gap between elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> until the adhesive is engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although shown as aligning in vacuum chamber <b>50</b>, the alignment operation can occur outside of the vacuum chamber and elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> can be transported to a vacuum tray table for vacuum lamination. At a step <b>136</b>, elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are laminated together. In a preferred embodiment, dry film vacuum lamination is utilized, although any other suitable technique can be utilized to attach or adhere element <b>44</b> to element <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, according to another exemplary embodiment, an alignment system <b>210</b> may be rotated so first display panel or element <b>244</b> and the second display panel or element <b>246</b> are on edge rather than horizontal. Process <b>100</b> can be performed with system <b>210</b>. Such system of supporting the display panels on edge is described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/009,373 incorporated hereby by reference. System <b>210</b> includes a first display element <b>244</b> and a second display element <b>246</b>. Display elements <b>244</b> and <b>246</b> are supported by vertical supports <b>264</b> and <b>266</b>. Supports <b>264</b> and <b>266</b> hold displays <b>244</b> and <b>246</b> in a generally vertical orientation at a small angle relative to each other. Supports <b>264</b> and <b>266</b> may be coupled to stages such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> that are configured to allow an operator to control the positions of support <b>264</b> (and display <b>244</b>) and support <b>266</b> (and display <b>246</b>). At least one fiducial mark <b>274</b> is provided on display element <b>244</b> and at least one fiducial mark <b>276</b> is provided on display element <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Like optical system <b>52</b> described above, an optical system <b>252</b> is configured to provide a user an indication of the positions of display elements <b>244</b> and <b>246</b> or can be part of an automated system for aligning display elements <b>244</b> and <b>246</b>. Optical system <b>52</b> is oriented generally horizontally, to the side of display elements <b>244</b> and <b>246</b> to view display <b>244</b> and <b>246</b> simultaneously in order to, for example, align corresponding fiducial marks <b>274</b> and <b>276</b> or align pixel elements, as described above. Alternatively, alignment can be achieved using the luminance alignment process discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Elements <b>244</b> and <b>246</b> and elements <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> may be placed and/or aligned using computing systems, environments, and/or configurations that may be suitable for utilization with location software and/or hardware, such as personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multimethodor systems, micromethodor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of an air filter, and more particularly to an air filter capable of filtering air dust in factories.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Normally speaking, when facilities are working in a factory, a large amount of dust would be produced, causing breathing problems to workers. The working environment would be dirty because of the piled dust.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, an air filter capable of filtering air dust to improve air quality would be necessary. Conventional air filter for the industry is mainly installed with a filter layer in an air entrance hole of a main body. A pressure fan would bring the air dust from the air entrance hole to the filter room, and the air dust goes through the filter layer. Finally, the fresh air goes out from an exit hole. A goal of filtering air is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, conventional air filter has only one filter layer. Users use cotton filters as the filter layer when they want to filter the air. But sometimes the dust is removed, and users want to use the air filter as an industry ventilator, users have to use a metal net to replace the cotton filters to promote efficiency of the industry ventilator and the lifetime of the cotton filters, preventing entrance of big stuff. Nevertheless, change processes are complex and time-consuming, and the inconvenience is increased for users.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Besides, when the conventional air filter is put to use, users could not see whether the cotton filters collect too many dust to perform filtering function by users' eyes directly. Usually, users would change the cotton filters when they find that the air filter is unable to filter the air dust, At the same time, users or workers have already breathed in a large amount of dust, causing influences on health, Moreover, skin keeping touch with the dust would cause allergy for users,</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, the filter layer of the air filter mentioned above is fixed on the main body by plural screws, Users would spend more time replacing the old filter layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As such, the present invention is arisen to obviate or at least mitigate the above mentioned disadvantages.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The main object of the present invention is to provide an air filter with two filter layers so that functions of the air filter can be switched easier and the filter layer can be changed faster.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve the above, the air filter of the present invention includes a main body, a pressure fan assembly, a filter module and a fix assembly. The main body comprises a containing room, an entrance hole and an exit hole. The entrance hole and the exit hole communicate with the containing room respectively. The pressure fan assembly is disposed in the containing room. The pressure fan assembly leads air to enter the containing room from the entrance hole and go out from the exit hole. The filter module comprises a first filter layer, a second filter layer and a frame body. The first filter layer is located in the entrance hole, and the second filter layer is located in the frame body detachably. The frame body is positioned at one side near the entrance hole of the main body. The frame body is capable of moving pivotally at one side near the entrance hole of the main body. The fix assembly fixes the frame body on the main body selectively. The frame body moves between an opening position and a closing position pivotally. When the frame body is located in the closing position, the frame body closes the entrance hole. The fix assembly fixes the frame body on the main body. When the frame body is located in the opening position, the frame body is away from the entrance hole.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Because one of the two filter layers can pivot with respect to the frame body, the air filter of the present invention enables users to select whether use only the first filter layer (the frame body pivots to the opening position) or use both filter layers (the frame body closes the entrance hole). Besides, when one of the two filters needs to be changed, users only have to pivot the frame body away from the entrance hole so that the filter can be replaced with a new one easily. As such, one of the progressive effects that use ways of the air filter can be switched easier is reached. Another progressive effect that the filter layers can be changed faster is performed as well.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention will become more obvious from the following description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, which show, for purpose of illustrations only, the preferred embodiment(s) in accordance with the present invention.</p>

The switch <b>53</b> can start up or shut down the pressure fan <b>20</b>. The setting device switches on the warning device when a use time of the second filter layer is over the pre-determined time. The warning device <b>52</b> can be a lighting member (For example: LED bulb.), a voicing device, or a device combination of the lighting member and the voicing device. Using other types of the warning device is also an option. By the warning device, users would be informed that the pre-determined time of second filter layer is due. And users can change the second filter to keep a working efficiency of the present invention and a air quality of a factory. Therefore, skin and lungs health of users and employees can be protected from harmful effects of dust.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The frame body <b>33</b> pivots about the main body <b>10</b> and to a closing position, and the frame body <b>33</b> would close the entrance hole <b>12</b>. When the frame body <b>33</b> closes the entrance hole <b>12</b>, the male buckle and the female buckle would buckle together. The buckle ring <b>412</b> buckles in the hook-shaped member so that the frame body <b>33</b> is fixed on the main body <b>10</b>. And then user's hands can hold the second end <b>414</b> of the lug to push so that the first end <b>413</b> of the lug pivots about the main body <b>10</b> and makes the hook-shaped member move to a buckling position. Finally, switching on the switch <b>53</b> to start up the pressure fan assembly <b>20</b>, and the air dust would pass through the second filter layer <b>32</b> and the first filter layer <b>31</b>, going into the containing room <b>11</b> from the entrance hole <b>12</b>. The clean air would go out from the exit hole. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the fixing assembly includes two male buckles and two female buckles so as to fix the frame body on the main body firmly.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">After the air dust is cleaned, users can detach the male buckle from the female buckle <b>42</b>. When the male buckle is detached from the female buckle <b>42</b>, the frame body <b>33</b> can pivot with respect to the main body <b>10</b> and to an opening position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the frame body is away from the entrance hole <b>12</b>. As such, the air filter of the present invention can be used as an industry ventilator. Because the frame body can be opened, the working efficiency of the pressure fan assembly is promoted. Moreover, the metal net is still disposed in the entrance hole to protect the pressure fan assembly from being invaded by big stuff.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to disinfection or deactivation of articles, such as medical, dental, pharmaceutical, veterinary or mortuary instruments and devices, and more particularly, to a microbial deactivation system having means for ultrasonic drying following a chemical microbial deactivation process.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Medical, dental, pharmaceutical, veterinary or mortuary instruments are routinely exposed to blood or other body fluids during various procedures. Following such procedures, a thorough cleaning and microbial deactivation of the instruments is required before subsequent use. Liquid microbial deactivation systems are now widely used to clean and deactivate instruments that cannot withstand the high temperature of a steam deactivation system. Liquid microbial deactivation systems typically operate by exposing the instruments to a liquid disinfectant or a deactivation composition, such as peracetic acid or some other strong oxidant. In such systems, the instruments to be cleaned are typically placed within a deactivation chamber of the deactivation system, or in a container that is placed within the deactivation chamber. During a deactivation cycle, a liquid disinfectant is then circulated through the deactivation chamber (and the container therein).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to maintain sterility of the instruments outside the deactivation system during storage, the instruments must be dried following completion of the deactivation cycle, thereby removing residual moisture from the instruments. The implementation of a separate &#x201c;drying cycle&#x201d; in the deactivation system significantly increases total processing time. Moreover, the liquid microbial deactivation system is unavailable for treatment of another load of instruments during the &#x201c;drying cycle.&#x201d; Use of a separate drying device independent of the deactivation system also results in several problems. First, it may be difficult to maintain sterility while transferring instruments from the deactivation device to the drying device. The use of a separate drying device also requires additional expense to purchase the drying device, and additional space at the point of use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art by providing a method and apparatus for ultrasonically drying articles in a liquid microbial deactivation system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for microbial deactivation of articles, the apparatus comprising: (a) a deactivation chamber dimensioned to receive a container enclosing at least one article to undergo microbial deactivation; (b) vibration means imparting vibrations to said container; (c) a fluid circulation system for circulating fluids through said deactivation chamber and inside said container; and (d) control means for controlling operation of said apparatus, wherein said control means activates said vibration means to produce vibrations having an ultrasonic frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for microbial deactivation of articles, the apparatus comprising: a deactivation chamber dimensioned to receive a container enclosing at least one article to undergo microbial deactivation, said container including first vibration means for imparting vibrations to said container; a fluid circulation system for circulating fluids through said deactivation chamber and inside said container; and control means for controlling operation of said apparatus, wherein said control means activates said vibration means to produce vibrations having an ultrasonic frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for removing moisture from inside an enclosed container following a liquid microbial deactivation process, said method comprising the steps of: (a) circulating dry air through the container; and (b) vibrating said container using vibration means that produce vibrations having an ultrasonic frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method and an apparatus for reducing drying time following a liquid microbial deactivation process.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another advantage of the present invention is the provision of a method and apparatus for facilitating a drying process through the production of vibrations having an ultrasonic frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other advantages will become apparent from the following description of an embodiment of the present invention taken together with the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In accordance with the present invention, one or more vibration means are located within the deactivation chamber defined by plate <b>642</b> and drawer tray <b>622</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the vibration means take the form of a device that vibrates at an ultrasonic frequency. By way of example, and not limitation, the vibration means takes the form of a piezoelectric transducer (PET). Other contemplated vibration means include, but are not limited to, magnetic coil actuators, pneumatically or hydraulically driven actuators, magneto-restrictive or capacitive actuators, and the like. An embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to a vibration means in the form of a PET.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As well known, piezoelectric transducers include piezoelectric crystals that convert electrical energy into vibrational mechanical energy. When piezoelectric crystals are subjected to an externally applied voltage, the crystals change shape by a small amount. As a result, piezoelectric transducers can convert ultrasonic frequency voltages to ultrasonic waves or vibrations. In accordance with the present invention, the ultrasonic vibrations produced by piezoelectric transducers are transferred to the residual liquid water droplets and films within container <b>800</b> to facilitate drying. The ultrasonic vibrations promote uniform dispersion of residual liquid water, thereby increasing the surface area of the same. Dispersion of the residual liquid water in this manner facilitates a phase change of the residual water to a vapor. The ultrasonic vibrations produced by piezoelectric transducers also facilitate the conversion of liquid water into a fine mist.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the illustrated embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, a first piezoelectric transducer (PET) <b>312</b> is located on the upper, inner surface of drawer tray <b>622</b>, and a second piezoelectric transducer <b>314</b> is located on the lower, inner surface of plate <b>642</b>. PETs <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> are dimensioned such that they contact the outer surface of container <b>800</b> when container <b>800</b> is sealed within the deactivation chamber. In this regard, PET <b>312</b> contacts the lower surface of bottom wall <b>814</b> of tray <b>812</b> to impart vibrations thereto. Likewise, PET <b>314</b> contacts the upper surface of lid <b>912</b> to impart vibrations thereto. It should be understood that the vibration means may have alternative locations external to container <b>800</b>, including locations inside and outside the deactivation chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to an alternative embodiment of the present invention vibration means are directly integrated into container <b>800</b>. In this regard, container <b>800</b> is adapted to include vibration means as a component of tray <b>812</b> and/or lid <b>912</b>. For example, vibration means may be integrated into bottom wall <b>814</b> of tray <b>812</b>. The vibration means directly integrated into container <b>800</b> may be substituted for the vibration means located external to container <b>800</b> (as described above), or may supplement the vibration means located external to container <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A system controller (not shown) is programmed to control the operation of components of apparatus <b>10</b>. The system controller receives data signals from devices (e.g., sensors), and transmits control signals to devices, such as motors, valves, vibration means and display units. The system controller may take the form of a microprocessor or a micro-controller.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, container <b>800</b> is best seen. Container <b>800</b> is generally comprised of a tray <b>812</b> and a lid <b>912</b> that is attachable to tray <b>812</b>. Tray <b>812</b> is generally cup-shaped and has a bottom wall <b>814</b> and a continuous side wall <b>816</b> that extends about the periphery of bottom wall <b>814</b> to one side thereof. Bottom wall <b>814</b> and side wall <b>816</b> define a cavity in which articles, such as medical instruments, devices or other items to be deactivated, are to be inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The upper edge of side wall <b>816</b> is shaped to define a channel dimensioned to receive a continuous, flexible seal <b>824</b>. In the embodiment shown, seal <b>824</b> is an inflatable seal. An air conduit <b>826</b>, schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, communicates with seal <b>824</b> by means of a fitting (not shown) that is mounted to container <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Lid <b>912</b> is generally a flat, planar element that is shaped to cover and enclose the opened, upper end of tray <b>812</b>. Lid <b>912</b> includes a downward-extending flange <b>914</b> that extends about the periphery of lid <b>912</b> and is dimensioned to capture the upper edge of side wall <b>816</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A locking device <b>922</b> is provided to secure lid <b>912</b> to tray <b>812</b>. In the embodiment shown, locking device <b>922</b> is an elongated, channel-like element that is pinned at one end to tray <b>812</b>. The channel defined in the locking device <b>922</b> is dimensioned to capture the upper edge of tray <b>812</b> and lid <b>912</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Apparatus <b>10</b> shall now further be described with reference to the operation thereof. One or more articles to be deactivated, such as medical, dental, pharmaceutical, veterinary or mortuary instruments or devices, are loaded into container <b>800</b>. Container <b>800</b> can accommodate numerous types of medical instruments and devices. Once the articles have been properly positioned within tray <b>812</b>, lid <b>912</b> is placed over tray <b>812</b> and is locked into position, using locking device <b>922</b> on tray <b>812</b>. With the articles to be microbially deactivated positioned within container <b>800</b>, an operator opens drawer assembly <b>600</b> of apparatus <b>10</b> to allow container <b>800</b> to be placed within drawer tray <b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A deactivation cycle for apparatus <b>10</b> includes a number of specific phases (i.e., preparation phase, system-seal phase, fill phase, circulation phase, chemistry-generation phase, exposure phase, and drain phase) that shall now be generally described.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preparation Phase</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">During a user-preparation phase, drawer assembly <b>600</b> of apparatus <b>10</b> is movable between a closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and an open position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by manual manipulation of control button <b>636</b> on front panel <b>634</b>. In preparation for a deactivation cycle, container <b>800</b> with the articles to be deactivated is placed within drawer tray <b>622</b> in drawer assembly <b>600</b>. As illustrated in the drawings, cavity <b>624</b> in tray <b>622</b> and the shape of container <b>800</b> are such that container <b>800</b> may be placed within cavity <b>624</b> in only one orientation. With container <b>800</b> placed within drawer tray <b>622</b>, drawer assembly <b>600</b> is moved to a closed position, using drawer control button <b>636</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">During this user-preparation phase, chemistry-holding device <b>430</b> is inserted within the chemistry-delivery system <b>400</b>. To this end, access panel <b>22</b><i>a </i>on housing structure <b>22</b> is moved to an open position to expose lid <b>420</b> of chemistry-delivery system <b>400</b>. Lid <b>420</b> is unlatched and opened to expose compartments <b>482</b>, <b>484</b> in chemistry-delivery system <b>400</b>. Chemistry-holding device <b>430</b> is inserted within housing <b>470</b>. Thereafter, lid <b>420</b> is closed and latched.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">System-Seal Phase</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">With container <b>800</b> within drawer tray <b>622</b> of drawer assembly <b>600</b> and drawer assembly <b>600</b> in a closed position, a deactivation cycle may be initiated. A first phase of the deactivation cycle is a system-sealing phase, wherein air is applied to inflatable bladder <b>646</b> above plate <b>642</b>. Inflating bladder <b>646</b> forces static seal <b>644</b> on plate <b>642</b> down into engagement with the planar surface of drawer tray <b>622</b>, thereby forming a complete seal around cavity <b>624</b> in drawer tray <b>622</b>, and forming a sealed, deactivation chamber containing container <b>800</b>. Bladder <b>646</b> is maintained in an inflated state throughout the deactivation cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Fill Phase</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">After bladder <b>646</b> has sealed container <b>800</b> within the deactivation chamber, a fill phase is initiated. Incoming water enters fluid circulation system <b>100</b> and proceeds to fill fluid circulation system <b>100</b>, the deactivation chamber, and container <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The incoming water is under pressure from an external source and forces water into fluid circulation system <b>100</b>, the deactivation chamber, and container <b>800</b>. As a result of water entering the apparatus <b>10</b>, air within the system is forced toward overflow line <b>292</b> that is preferably disposed at the highest point of apparatus <b>10</b>. Directional check valve <b>293</b> allows air and water to exit the deactivation chamber. The presence of water flowing through overflow line <b>292</b> is sensed by proximity sensor <b>294</b>. Water flowing through drain line <b>292</b> is indicative that apparatus <b>10</b> is filled. The system controller then stops the flow of water into apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Circulation Phase</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Once apparatus <b>10</b> is filled with water, the system controller initiates a circulation phase to circulate water throughout fluid circulation system <b>100</b>. During the circulation phase, water is circulated throughout fluid circulation system <b>100</b>, including the deactivation chamber and container <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The purpose of the circulation phase is to achieve the proper fluid temperature to deactivate the articles located in container <b>800</b>. At periods throughout the fill phase and the circulation phase, a heater may be activated to increase the temperature of the water flowing throughout the system to maintain a desired fluid temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Chemistry-Generation Phase</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Following the circulation phase, water flows through chemistry-delivery system <b>400</b> to produce a liquid microbial deactivation fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Exposure Phase</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">During the exposure phase, the microbial deactivation fluid formed in the chemistry-generation phase is conveyed throughout fluid circulation system <b>100</b>. The microbial deactivation fluid flowing through first and second fluid inlet lines <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> flows into the deactivation chamber and into container <b>800</b> therein. The deactivation fluid flowing into container <b>800</b> is sprayed through spray nozzles around the exterior of the articles (e.g., medical instruments and devices) within container <b>800</b>. Deactivation fluid circulates through the deactivation chamber formed by drawer tray <b>622</b> and plate <b>642</b> and flows out of the deactivation chamber to return line <b>162</b>. Similarly, fluid flows out of container <b>800</b> through a return conduit to return line <b>162</b>. During the exposure phase, deactivation fluid is circulated throughout fluid circulation system <b>100</b> and through the deactivation chamber and container <b>800</b> for a predetermined period of time. The circulation time is sufficient to decontaminate articles within container <b>800</b> and to decontaminate the components and fluid conduits of fluid circulation system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Drain Phase</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After a predetermined exposure period, the system controller initiates a drain phase. The drain phase is comprised basically of two steps. During the drain phase, valves to chemical-delivery system <b>400</b> are closed to prevent flow thereto. Valves in the drain lines are opened. Pumps continue to operate for a predetermined period of time, forcing the deactivation fluid in the deactivation chamber and container <b>800</b> out through the drain lines. At the same time, valves are opened to allow water to enter the system and flush chemistry-delivery system <b>400</b>. Water entering chemistry-delivery system <b>400</b> is drained from fluid circulation system <b>100</b> through a drain line.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">After a predetermined period of time sufficient to allow flushing of chemistry-delivery system <b>400</b> and after a period sufficient to allow draining of most of the fluid from fluid circulation system <b>100</b>, the pumps are deactivated. Valves are closed to stop the flow of water to chemistry-delivery system <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A drying process is commenced by releasing a source of filtered, dry, pressurized air into the chemistry-delivery system <b>400</b>. The dry air blows the remaining water within chemistry-delivery system <b>400</b> out through a drain line. Similarly, pressurized, dry air is applied to air line <b>152</b> and, thus, is conveyed through the lower portion of fluid circulation system <b>100</b> to blow out remaining fluid within the internal passages of instruments in container <b>800</b>. The pressurized, dry air may be heated to facilitate the drying process. For example, the air may be heated to a temperature in the range of about 25&#xb0; C. to about 190&#xb0; C. The preferred heating temperature will be a temperature that does not cause damage to the instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In accordance with the present invention, first piezoelectric transducer (PET) <b>312</b> and second piezoelectric transducer (PET) <b>314</b> are activated by the system controller during all or part of the drain phase to produce ultrasonic waves. PETs <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> facilitate the drying process, as will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Once the drain phase has been completed, an indication is provided on the display panel <b>28</b> of housing structure <b>22</b>. At that time, the air pressure to bladder <b>646</b> is removed to allow retraction of plate <b>642</b> and static seal <b>644</b> from the surface of drawer tray <b>622</b>. Drawer assembly <b>600</b> may then be moved to an open position by pressing drawer-activation button <b>636</b>. With drawer assembly <b>600</b> in an open position, container <b>800</b> can be removed from drawer tray <b>622</b>. Since the fluid connections are in a closed position when container <b>800</b> is removed from drawer tray <b>622</b>, microbial decontamination of the interior of container <b>800</b> is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As discussed above, PETs <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> convert voltages to vibrations having an ultrasonic frequency. Since PETs <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> are in contact with surfaces of container <b>800</b>, container <b>800</b> is ultrasonically vibrated. The ultrasonic waves are transferred to liquid water inside container <b>800</b>, including liquid droplets and films on the articles located therein. The ultrasonic waves promote dispersion of residual liquid water and the conversion of dispersed liquid water into a fine water mist. Increased dispersion of residual liquid water contributes to faster drying due to increased surface area of residual liquid water available for phase change. The dispersion of the liquid water also facilitates draining of liquid water from container <b>800</b>. The fine water mist is more easily removed from container <b>800</b> by the dry air circulating therethrough. As a result of the foregoing, the drying time required for removing residual water from container <b>800</b> and the articles located therein is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The ultrasonic waves introduced into container <b>800</b> by PETs <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> are also transferred to the air particles inside container <b>800</b>. Ultrasonic vibration of the air particles facilitates the drying process by creating pressure waves (i.e., pulsating air). As the ultrasound pressure increases, molecular vibrations become more intense. As a result air particles in the field of the ultrasonic vibrations are displaced in harmony with the ultrasonic wave propagation, thus causing acoustic or turbulent flows within the volume of container <b>800</b> and near surfaces of container <b>800</b>, thereby enhancing the drying process. In addition, ultrasound waves make ambient gas vibrate above the surface of porous materials, and acoustically create flows that carry moisture molecules away from the porous material. As a result, moisture removal from porous materials is promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The use of ultrasonic waves in combination with a conventional drying processes reduces drying times, thereby allowing an apparatus for microbial deactivation to complete multiple consecutive microbial deactivation cycles within a shorter period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention, an ultrasonic receiver may also be mounted adjacent to the outer surface of container <b>800</b> in order to measure the rate of attenuation of the ultrasonic wave produced inside container <b>800</b> by the vibration means (e.g., PETs <b>312</b> and <b>314</b>). In this regard, attenuation of the ultrasonic waves inside container <b>800</b> may be used to determine whether the drying process has been completed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, an ultrasonic receiver <b>316</b> may be located on the lower, inner surface of plate <b>642</b>. It is also contemplated that the ultrasonic receiver may be located on the upper, inner surface of drawer tray <b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The system controller records a wave profile when the drying process or drain phase begins. The recorded wave profile is indicative of the ultrasonic wave produced inside container <b>800</b>. Throughout the drying process new wave profiles are periodically recorded by the system controller. Each new wave profile is compared to the previously recorded wave profile. While the water content of container <b>800</b> is decreasing, the ultrasonic wave will attenuate. When no further moisture is being removed from container <b>800</b>, no further attenuation of the ultrasonic wave will be observed. Once the system controller determines that the drying process has been completed, the drying cycle can be terminated by deactivating the supply of dry air.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Following completion of the drain phase described above, the deactivated articles may remain within container <b>800</b> and may be stored for future use, with the articles in container <b>800</b> remaining in a microbially deactivated environment. In this respect, container <b>800</b> may be inserted into a compartment of a storage cabinet, wherein connections on the bottom of container <b>800</b> engage and mate with connectors to allow dry, filtered air to be circulated into and out of the interior of container <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purposes of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Ignition of an air-fuel mixture gas in an internal combustion engine is normally performed by spark discharge using an ignition plug. However, there have been proposals for a microwave ignition system that uses electromagnetic waves with a frequency of several gigahertz (GHz); i.e., microwaves, for improving combustion efficiency and other purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to reliably ignite the air-fuel mixture gas only using microwaves, an extremely strong electrical field is required; therefore, there is a need to put a cavity in a resonant state. As an attempt to resolve this problem, it was proposed in Patent References 1 and 2 for a stub structure for regulating the resonance frequency to be provided in a combustion chamber. It was proposed in Patent Reference 3 for a resonance structure to be provided in the plug in order to obtain a strong electrical field.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Means for combining spark discharge and microwave energy is proposed in patent reference 4. According to a technique described in patent reference 4, an electrode for the spark discharge and an electrode for receiving the microwave energy are each provided separately in a cavity, and are configured so that a strong electrical field is formed in a region of the spark discharge electrode that is physically distant from the electrode for radiating microwaves.

<p id="p-0038" num="0041">The ignition or plasma generation apparatus thereby eliminates the need for an ignition plug with a complex structure, a special structure for providing incident microwaves with resonant characteristics in a combustion chamber, or a similar provision; and makes it possible to combine a spark discharge and microwave energy in an engine system with a conventionally-used ignition plug for spark discharge or a conventionally structured combustion chamber, and improve combustion efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">Any of the second through fifth aspects of the mixer in the ignition or plasma generation apparatus make it possible for a first input section to be electrically coupled to an output section by an electric field coupling; the first input section to be electrically coupled to the output section by a magnetic field coupling; the first input section to be electrically coupled to the output section by a magnetic field coupling and an electrical field coupling connected in series; or an input section from the high-voltage pulse generating equipment to be electrically coupled to an output section by a self-inductance type of inductive element.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">Any of the sixth through tenth aspects enable the mixer in the ignition or plasma generation apparatus to be constituted by a printed circuit board and readily mass-produced.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">The eleventh aspect makes it possible for the mixer in the ignition or plasma generation apparatus to be imparted with a modular structure that is integrated with an ignition coil, both the microwave energy and the high-voltage pulse to be introduced to the combustion chamber and an air-fuel mixture gas in the combustion chamber ignited using a regular ignition plug without having to modify a main body of an internal combustion engine, and for manufacturing to be performed at a cost equivalent to that of assembling a conventional ignition coil.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">The thirteenth aspect makes it possible for the mixer in the ignition or plasma generation apparatus to be imparted with a modular structure integrated with an ignition plug and an antenna, and both the microwave energy and the high-voltage pulse to be introduced to the combustion chamber and an air-fuel mixture gas in the combustion chamber ignited using a regular ignition coil without modifying a main body of an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">Furthermore, the fourteenth aspect of the ignition or plasma generation apparatus enables the microwave energy and high-voltage pulse to be introduced into an interior of the combustion chamber via a coaxial cable and an isolator, resulting in an easier line wiring process, and making it possible to prevent or reduce a flow of a reflection of the microwave energy reversing back to the mixer.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">An embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a basic configuration of an ignition or plasma generation apparatus <b>10</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">In the ignition or plasma generation apparatus <b>10</b>, energy generated by each of a high-voltage pulse generator <b>11</b> and a microwave generator <b>12</b> is transmitted to a mixing circuit <b>13</b> that constitutes the mixer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The mixing circuit <b>13</b> mixes the energy fed from the high-voltage pulse generator <b>11</b> and the microwave generator <b>12</b>. The energy mixed in the mixing circuit <b>13</b> is supplied to an ignition plug <b>27</b> inserted into a combustion chamber <b>14</b> via a mixed output cable <b>26</b> that constitutes a transmission channel for the energy.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a circuit configuration of the mixing circuit <b>13</b> in the ignition apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">In the mixing circuit <b>13</b>, a high-voltage pulse from the high-voltage pulse generator <b>11</b> is inputted into a first input terminal <b>25</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The first input terminal <b>25</b> is connected to an output terminal <b>28</b> via a self-inductance coil <b>24</b>. The output terminal <b>28</b> is connected to the mixed output cable <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">Also, in the mixing circuit <b>13</b>, microwave energy generated by the microwave generator <b>12</b> is inputted into a second input terminal <b>21</b>. The second input terminal <b>21</b> is connected to the output terminal <b>28</b> via a capacitor <b>22</b><i>a </i>and a capacitor <b>22</b><i>b</i>. One end of a coil <b>23</b> for adjusting impedance is connected between the capacitor <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the capacitor <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and the other end is earthed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">A capacitor with a small capacity of between several picofarads and several tens of picofarads is selected for the capacitor <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the capacitor <b>22</b><i>b</i>. Having such properties means that the capacitor <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the capacitor <b>22</b><i>b </i>allow microwaves of several gigahertz (GHz) to pass between the second input terminal <b>21</b> and the output terminal <b>28</b>, while shortwave band frequencies are blocked. For the coil <b>24</b>, one that has an impedance of several tens of nanohenries to several microhenries is chosen. Having such properties means that microwaves are blocked in the coil <b>24</b>, while shortwave band frequencies can travel through.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">Therefore, a high-voltage pulse inputted through the first input terminal <b>25</b> travels through the coil <b>24</b> and is transmitted to the output terminal <b>28</b>, but does not flow to the second input terminal <b>21</b> because of the presence of the capacitors <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>. Also, microwaves inputted through the second input terminal <b>21</b> travel through the capacitors <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>and are transmitted to the output terminal <b>28</b>, but are blocked from flowing to the first input terminal <b>25</b> because of the presence of the coil <b>24</b>. As a result, the high-voltage pulse inputted through the first input terminal <b>25</b> and the microwave inputted through the second input terminal <b>21</b> are mixed and outputted through the output terminal <b>28</b>. The mixed output is supplied through the mixed output cable <b>26</b> to the ignition plug <b>27</b>.</p>

In the mixing circuit <b>30</b>, a second input terminal <b>21</b> is connected to a primary winding of a high-frequency transformer <b>33</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. One end of a secondary winding of the high-frequency transformer <b>33</b> is connected to a first input terminal <b>25</b> via a coil <b>34</b> that has a similar property to the coil <b>24</b> in the first embodiment. The connection between the one end of the secondary winding of the high-frequency transformer <b>33</b> and the coil <b>34</b> is configured so that a stray capacitance <b>36</b> is present in relation to earth. This section is therefore in a state equivalent to being earthed. As a result, the microwave energy inputted through the second input terminal <b>21</b> is transmitted to the output terminal <b>28</b> without flowing to the first input terminal <b>25</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0077">In the mixing circuit <b>40</b>, a second input terminal <b>21</b> is electrically coupled to an output terminal <b>28</b> by a magnetic field coupling and an electrical field coupling connected in series, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In the mixing circuit <b>40</b>, a second input terminal <b>21</b> is connected to a primary winding of a high-frequency transformer <b>43</b>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0079">The mixing circuit <b>50</b> further has a tuning stub <b>53</b> provided between the second input terminal <b>21</b> and the capacitor <b>22</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0077" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a side view of a circuit board <b>60</b> in an ignition apparatus according to a fifth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0081">A mixing circuit in an ignition or plasma generation apparatus according to any of the first through fourth embodiments described above can be mounted on a circuit board. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the circuit board <b>60</b> includes the mixing circuit <b>13</b> configured on a double-sided substrate <b>66</b> (&#x201c;substrate&#x201d; hereafter) made of a dielectric material. Conductive patterns <b>64</b><i>a </i>and <b>64</b><i>b </i>are formed on the circuit board <b>60</b> in opposing positions across the substrate <b>66</b>. The conductive patterns <b>64</b><i>a </i>and <b>64</b><i>b </i>form a capacitor with the substrate <b>66</b> constituting a dielectric thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0082">Microwave energy inputted into a microwave input terminal <b>61</b> is transmitted to the conductive pattern <b>64</b><i>b </i>via transmission paths <b>67</b><i>a </i>and <b>67</b><i>b </i>and a chip <b>68</b> for adjusting properties. From the conductive pattern <b>64</b><i>b</i>, the microwave energy is transmitted to the conductive pattern <b>64</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0080" num="0083">Meanwhile, a high-voltage pulse inputted into a high-voltage pulse input terminal <b>62</b> is transmitted to a transmission path <b>67</b><i>f </i>via transmission paths <b>67</b><i>d </i>and <b>67</b><i>e </i>and a coil <b>65</b>. The high-voltage pulse travels through the conductive pattern <b>64</b><i>a </i>and is transmitted to the mixed output terminal <b>63</b> via the transmission paths <b>67</b><i>g </i>and <b>67</b><i>h</i>.

The impedance adjustment stub <b>73</b> functions as a stub for adjusting impedance according to the position at which the short-circuiting element <b>72</b> is inserted. In general, assuming the characteristic impedance of a transmission path to be Z<b>0</b>, the impedance Z at the input end when a terminal end is short-circuited is represented as follows:</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0087">More specifically, by adjusting the length L between the input end and the short-circuit point, with &#x3bb;/2 being the maximum length, impedance equivalently introduced in parallel can be varied, and the input impedance of the mixing circuit can be adjusted.</p>

In the plug <b>100</b>, the first center conductor <b>103</b> and the second center conductor <b>104</b> are connected by a CR composite device <b>110</b> instead of the electrical resistor.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a cross-section view of the CR composite device <b>110</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram for the CR composite device <b>110</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the CR composite device <b>110</b> includes a cylindrical resistance layer <b>111</b> provided between the first center conductor <b>103</b> and the second center conductor <b>104</b> along an inner wall of the cylindrical insulator <b>102</b>, and a dielectric layer <b>112</b> formed in a space enclosed by the first center conductor <b>103</b>, the second center conductor <b>104</b>, and the resistance layer <b>111</b>. The first center conductor <b>103</b>, the second center conductor <b>104</b>, and the dielectric layer <b>112</b> form a capacitor. In electrical terms, the resistance layer <b>111</b> is electrically connected in parallel to a capacitor <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0105">The resistance layer <b>111</b> is made of a regular resistant body. A carbon fiber film, electrically conductive glass fiber film, or a similar material is suitable in terms of ease of shaping, but the resistance layer <b>111</b> is not limited to such materials. The dielectric layer <b>112</b> is made of a regular dielectric body, and any suitable material may be used therefor. The section with the dielectric layer <b>112</b> may also be a vacuum. It is nevertheless preferable for the dielectric layer to have a sufficient insulating capacity with regards to the high pulse voltage applied to the plug <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0106">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, when a high DC pulse voltage is applied to the first center conductor <b>103</b>, the high pulse voltage is transmitted to the second center conductor <b>104</b> via the resistance layer <b>111</b> without being transmitted through the capacitor <b>120</b>. DC noise from the second center conductor <b>104</b> reverses so as to flow to the first center conductor, also through the resistance layer <b>111</b>. As a result, the CR composite device <b>110</b> has an effect of reducing noise similar to that of a resistor in a regular resistor plug when a DC pulse voltage is applied</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0107">The presence of the capacitor <b>120</b> results in an electrical coupling (capacitive coupling) between the first center conductor <b>103</b> and the second center conductor. Therefore, when electromagnetic waves are applied to a coaxial line comprising the first center conductor <b>103</b> and the main metal fitting <b>101</b>, they will not only be transmitted to the second center conductor <b>104</b> via the resistance layer <b>111</b> but also through the capacitor <b>120</b> to the second center conductor. The electromagnetic waves can be transmitted with a greater transmission efficiency than a regular resistor plug by the amount transmitted through the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0108">As described above, using the plug according to the present embodiment makes it possible to obtain sufficient electromagnetic wave transmission efficiency while maintaining an effect of reducing DC high pulse voltage reflection noise similar to that of a regular resistor plug.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0109">The resistance layer may be one that entirely encloses the dielectric layer, or one that partially encloses the dielectric layer. The resistance layer is not necessarily required to be in contact with the dielectric layer.</p>

As with a regular spark plug, the plug <b>130</b> includes a main metal fitting <b>131</b> made of a conductive body and a cylindrical insulator <b>132</b> that penetrates the main metal fitting <b>131</b>. A substantially rod-shaped center conductor <b>133</b> is accommodated within the insulator <b>132</b>. Both ends of the center conductor <b>133</b> protrude from the insulator <b>132</b>. One end section forms a connecting section that connects with the mixing circuit, and the other end section functions both as a discharge electrode and an antenna. A protruding section <b>134</b> is provided on the main metal fitting <b>131</b> towards the discharge electrode-antenna end; the protruding section <b>134</b> constitutes an earthing electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows transverse cross-sections A-A&#x2032;, B-B&#x2032;, C-C&#x2032; of the plug <b>130</b>. The transverse cross-sections of the plug <b>130</b> are shaped so that the diameter of an inner surface of the main metal fitting <b>131</b> relative to the diameter of the center conductor <b>133</b> increases from the connecting section that connects with the mixing circuit to the electrode-antenna end. Such a shape causes the impedance in the direction from the connecting section to the electrode-antenna end to decrease with increasing proximity to the electrode end. The impedance between the mixing circuit end and the discharge electrode end is thereby matched, reducing transmission loss.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0112">The method for adjusting the impedance is not limited to use of the ratio between the diameter of the inner surface of the main metal fitting <b>131</b> and the diameter of the center conductor <b>133</b>; the impedance may be adjusted using the material used in the insulator <b>132</b>.

<p id="p-0110" num="0113">In each of the above-mentioned embodiments, a distal end of the plug has a similar form to that of a regular spark plug. Configuring the plug so that a plasma is ejected in a predetermined direction increases the usefulness of the ignition or plasma generation apparatus according to each of the embodiments when used as a plasma source.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a schematic view of a distal end section of a plug having a structure whereby a plasma is ejected in a predetermined direction. In a plug <b>140</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a center conductor <b>141</b> is connected to a center line of an output section of a mixing circuit. An antenna-center electrode section <b>142</b> is connected to, or formed in an integrated manner at, a distal end portion of the center conductor <b>141</b> (i.e., at an opposite end to a connecting section that connects with the mixing circuit). The plug <b>140</b> also has an outer conductor <b>143</b> that encloses the center conductor <b>141</b> and the antenna-center electrode section <b>142</b> up to a distal end of the antenna-center electrode section <b>142</b>. A space between the center conductor <b>141</b> and the outer conductor <b>143</b> is filled with a dielectric member <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0115">The dielectric member <b>144</b> may, like an insulator, be made of a ceramic material, or alternatively may be made of glass or a plastic material such as a resin. With regards to the plug <b>140</b>, a section between the connecting section that connects with the mixing circuit and the center conductor <b>141</b> as well as the antenna-center electrode section <b>142</b> may have a similar structure to that of a regular spark plug, or a similar structure to the plug according to the ninth or the tenth embodiments described above.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0116">The dielectric member <b>144</b> is not loaded into a region surrounding the antenna-center electrode section <b>142</b>. A void <b>145</b> having a predetermined volume is defined by the antenna-center electrode section <b>142</b>, the outer conductor <b>143</b>, and the dielectric member <b>144</b>. An opening <b>146</b> is provided on the outer conductor <b>143</b> in a vicinity of the antenna-center electrode section <b>142</b>. The opening <b>146</b> links the void <b>145</b> with the exterior.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0117">The insulation distance between the antenna-center electrode <b>142</b> and the outer conductor <b>143</b> is preferably at a minimum in a vicinity of the opening <b>146</b>. When a configuration of such description is used, an electrical discharge is produced and a plasma is generated in the vicinity of the opening <b>146</b>, electromagnetic waves simultaneously generate a strong electrical field in the region, and the plasma expands.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0118">When the plug <b>140</b> receives energy from the mixing circuit, a plasma is generated in the space <b>145</b> in the vicinity of the opening <b>146</b>. The generated plasma heats gas inside the space <b>145</b>, increasing the pressure in the space <b>145</b>. A pressure difference is thereby created between the void <b>145</b> and the exterior. The resulting pressure difference pushes the plasma generated in the vicinity of the opening <b>146</b> to the exterior. As a result, the plasma is ejected from the opening <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0119">Since the plug <b>140</b> according to the present invention has a structure whereby a pressure difference is used to eject the plasma, the volume of the void <b>145</b> is selected so that the pressure difference obtained by the plasma heating the interior of the void <b>145</b> and increasing the pressure therein is sufficiently large for the plasma to be ejected. The pressure difference that is sufficiently large for the plasma to be ejected is determined by the viscosity and other physical properties of the generated plasma and the amount of energy applied to the plug <b>140</b> for increasing the temperature. The appropriate volume is therefore selected according to the amount of energy applied and plasma source gas.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0120">A gas inlet channel <b>147</b> for introducing gas into the void <b>145</b> may also be provided, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The plasma source gas can be selected by selecting a gas to introduce through the gas inlet channel <b>147</b>. Introduction of the gas also makes it possible to increase the internal pressure in the void <b>145</b>, aiding the plasma ejection.</p>

<p id="p-0119" num="0122">The cap <b>152</b> is shaped as a cylinder in which an end opposite the threadedly engaging portion is narrowed. An opening <b>153</b> provided to the narrowed end links the interior space in the cap to the exterior. The insulation distance of the cap <b>152</b> is at a minimum in the vicinity of the opening <b>153</b> and the center electrode of the main plug body <b>151</b>. The volume of a void surrounded by the main plug body <b>151</b> and the cap <b>152</b> may be determined in a similar manner to the volume of the void <b>145</b> according to the eleventh embodiment.

<p id="p-0120" num="0123">According to the present embodiment, a plasma can be ejected using a conventional spark plug, the plug according to the ninth embodiment, or the plug according to the tenth embodiment.

<p id="p-0121" num="0124">The ignition or plasma generation apparatus according to the eleventh or the twelfth embodiment makes it possible to eject a plasma using a plug that is both compact and has a simple structure. The plasma may be used to ignite an internal combustion engine or a similar device, or used as a plasma source for composition analysis. As an example of application as a plasma source, the present embodiment shows an analysis apparatus using plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a schematic drawing showing a configuration of an analysis apparatus according to the present embodiment. The analysis apparatus <b>160</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> includes an ignition or plasma generation apparatus <b>300</b> according to the twelfth embodiment, a test sample introduction device <b>161</b> for introducing or placing a test sample into a region that contains plasma to be ejected from the ignition or plasma generation apparatus <b>300</b>, an analysis device <b>162</b> for analyzing results of exposing the test sample to the plasma ejected from ignition or plasma generation apparatus <b>300</b>, a detection device <b>163</b> for converting results of the analysis performed by the analysis device <b>162</b> into a signal in a predetermined format, and a signal processor <b>164</b> for processing results of the signal generated by the detection device <b>163</b> and displaying the results of the detection and the analysis to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0126">The test sample introduction device <b>161</b> is one that is capable of placing the test sample so as to be exposed to the plasma ejected from ignition or plasma generation apparatus <b>300</b>. For example, in an instance where the test sample is a solid, the test sample introduction device <b>161</b> may be a supporting tool capable of positioning the test sample relative to the ignition or plasma generation apparatus. In an instance where the test sample is a fluid, the test sample introduction device <b>161</b> may be a fluid flow channel, a fluid container, or a fluid ejection device. Also, in an instance where the test sample is a fluid, a chromatography column or a similar device may be provided upstream of the test sample introduction device <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0127">The analysis device <b>162</b> may be appropriately selected according to the type of test sample expected to be used. For example, it is possible to use a device that separates an excited test sample using an electrical or magnetic field and analyzes the test sample, such as a magnetic deflection type, a quadrupole type, an ion-trap type, a time-of-flight type, a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance type, or a tandem type analyzer. Alternatively, an optical analyzer comprising a photoreceiver, a spectrometer, and an optical system for providing an optical path between the photoreceiver and the spectrometer may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0128">For the detection device <b>163</b>, one that is compatible with the analysis method used by the analysis device <b>162</b> may be selected as appropriate. For example, a device that uses a photomultiplier tube, a microchannel plate detector, or a similar device to increase the quantity of, and detect, electrons transported from the excited test sample may be used. A device that uses a Faraday cup or a similar device to perform measurements on the excited test sample may also be used. A detection device comprising a cloud chamber and an imaging device may also be used. In an instance where an optical analyzer is used as the analysis device <b>162</b>, the detection device may be an optical sensor or an image sensor that uses a photomultiplier, a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor device, a charge-coupled device, or a similar device.</p>

<p id="h-0020" num="0000">&#x3c;Other Variations&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0131">In the embodiments described above, rectangular or circular electrode plates are used as examples of the electrode plates in the capacitor used for capacitive coupling; however, the present invention is not limited in scope to such embodiments. An electrode plate of any shape may be used, provided a favorable electrical coupling can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0132">Also, as long as the electrical field distribution in the dielectric positioned between the capacitor electrodes is not required to be uniform, the width of the conductive patterns forming the capacitor may exceed one quarter of the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0133">In the embodiments described above, a spark plug and a plug having a coaxial transmission path are used as examples of a plug; however, the plug according to the present invention is not limited to plugs of such description. A coaxial structure is not a necessary requirement, as long as the structure makes it possible to favorably transmit and radiate electromagnetic waves. For example, a plug having transmission lines in parallel may also be used. Alternatively, a glow plug with a discharge electrode may also be used. One of the pair of conductors constituting the discharge electrode may be a glow plug filament, or a conductor connected to a glow plug filament.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0134">Also, the plug is not necessarily required to have an earthing electrode within. Of the conductors constituting a discharge electrode, the conductor on the earthed side may be provided separate to the plug. For example, in an instance where the plug is attached to a metal object or the plug is attached in an immediate vicinity of a metal object, the metal object may be used as the earthing electrode as long as the metal object is earthed.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0135">In the embodiments described above, a DC (pulse voltage) is used to supply energy for electrical discharge; however, the present invention is not limited in scope in this respect. The energy for electrical discharge may be in AC, and high-frequency AC may be used. In an instance where the energy for discharge is in AC, it is possible to minimize a reverse flow of electromagnetic waves traveling back to the discharge energy transmission line as long as the discharge energy transmission line is configured so that coupling by an electric or magnetic field coupling takes place at a step that is located upstream of a section in which electromagnetic wave energy is superimposed. In such an instance, it is preferable that the frequency of the discharge energy is different from the frequency of the electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0136">In the embodiments described above, pulse voltage to be applied to the ignition plug and microwaves are superimposed on each other on the same transmission line; and energy in the form of light, sound, shock waves, friction, or heat may also be supplied on the same transmission line in a superimposed fashion. It becomes possible to use the energies listed for ignition or plasma generation.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0137">Although a specific form of embodiment of the instant invention has been described above and illustrated in the accompanying drawings in order to be more clearly understood, the above description is made by way of example and not as a limitation to the scope of the instant invention. It is contemplated that various modifications apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art could be made without departing from the scope of the invention which is to be determined by the following claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for measuring the amount of histamine from a skin sample and the objective link and correlation of the amount of histamine as it directly correlates to itch perception in mammals.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The importance of the symptom of itch in scalp dermatitis has been evaluated in the past. The most frequently described condition associated with unhealthy scalp is itch. This is also the most bothersome symptom, having the largest negative influence on sufferers' quality of life.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With regard to the general physiology of itch, the perception of itch represents the end of a complex physiological pathway that is initiated at the skin surface. A number of stimuli can start the cascade of events that eventually lead to the perception of itch. The stimulus binds to specialized receptor cells in the dermis triggering the release of histamine. Histamine then binds to the nerve endings, starting an electrical pathway along the nerve fiber that is transferred along the spinal column until it is received in the brain and interpreted as itch.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, while there is a wide range of potential mediators of itch, histamine is considered the prototypical physiological chemical mediator of itch. Histamine is a small molecule amine that was shown in 1927 to be a natural constituent of skin tissue (hence the name from the Greek word for tissue, histos). Key support for the direct role of histamine in itch is that antihistamines can be very effective in relieving itch in some skin conditions. Another argument in favor of the role of histamine is that it can be used to experimentally induce itch.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For specific cases, the strength of the association between histamine and itch has been studied for a number of specific skin conditions. There is a very strong association between histamine levels and itch severity for conditions such as urticaria and insect bites. The association with atopic dermatitis is less well-defined. Higher histamine levels have been found in the skin of sufferers of eczema and psoriasis. Even dry skin has been found to result in higher histamine levels.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the histamine levels in dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis have not been previously investigated, it is likely there is a strong relationship between the itch severity and histamine levels. First, psoriasis and dandruff share many common etiological features, making it likely that the established histamine-itch relationship in psoriasis will apply to dandruff as well. It has also been demonstrated [Harding, C., A. Moore, J. Rogers, H. Meldrum, et al., <i>Dandruff: a condition characterized by decreased levels of intercellular lipids in scalp stratum corneum and impaired barrier function</i>. Arch. Dermatol. Res., 2002. 294: p. 221-230.] that dandruff sufferers have an increased incidence of itch in response to topically applied histamine, demonstrating the physiological relevance of histamine in scalp itch associated with dandruff.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Alternative biomarkers which may serve as mediators for itch are Substance P, and cannabinoids. Other possible mediators are provided in Neurophysiology of Pruritus; Cutaneous Elicitation of Itch; Arch Dermatol./Vol. 139, November 2003 and incorporated by reference herein.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">All temperatures are in degrees Celsius, unless specifically stated otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Except as otherwise noted, all amounts including quantities, percentages, portions, and proportions, are understood to be modified by the word &#x201c;about&#x201d;, and amounts are not intended to indicate significant digits.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Except as otherwise noted, the articles &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; mean &#x201c;one or more&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Herein, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; means that other steps and other ingredients which do not affect the end result can be added. This term encompasses the terms &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d;. The compositions and methods/processes of the present invention can comprise, consist of, and consist essentially of the essential elements and limitations of the invention described herein, as well as any of the additional or optional ingredients, components, steps, or limitations described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Herein, &#x201c;effective&#x201d; means an amount of a subject active high enough to provide a significant positive modification of the condition to be treated. An effective amount of the subject active will vary with the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition, the duration of the treatment, the nature of concurrent treatment, and like factors.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The term &#x2018;skin&#x2019; means the outer covering of a vertebrate animal, consisting of two layers of cells, a thick inner layer (the dermis) and a thin outer layer (the epidermis). The epidermis is the external, nonvascular layer of the skin. It is made up, from within outward, of five layers of EPITHELIUM: (1) basal layer (stratum basale epidermidis); (2) spinous layer (stratum spinosum epidermidis); (3) granular layer (stratum granulosum epidermidis); (4) clear layer (stratum lucidum epidermidis); and (5) horny layer (stratum corneum epidermidis).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The term &#x201c;sample&#x201d; refers to any preparation from skin or epidermis of a subject.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The tern &#x201c;non-invasive&#x201d; means a procedure that does not require insertion of an instrument or device through the skin or a body orifice for diagnosis or treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The term &#x201c;adhesive device&#x201d; means a device used for the removal of the skin's epidermal layer by using an adhesive or an adhesive material on a substrate. For example, skin samples with adhesive tapes such as D-Squame&#xae; (polyacrylate ester adhesives; CuDerm; Dallas Tex.), Durapor, Sebutape&#x2122; (acrylic polymer films; CuDern; Dallas, Tex.), Tegaderm&#x2122;, Duct tape (333 Duct Tape, Nashua tape products), Scotch&#xae; Tape (3M Scotch 810, St. Paul, Minn.), Diamond&#x2122; (The Sellotape Company; Eindhoven, the Netherlands), Sentega&#x2122; (polypropylene tape, Sentega Eiketten BV, Utrecht, The Netherlands) may be used. The adhesive may be any of the commonly used pressure-sensitive-type adhesives or those which solidify quickly upon skin content (such as cynaoacylates). The adhesives may be on flexible or solid backings to make sampling easier. A constant pressure device (e.g. Desquame Pressure Instrument, CuDerm; Dallas, Tex.) can be used to apply pressure to the adhesive device during sampling.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Samples from a tissue may be isolated by any number of means well known in the art. Invasive methods for isolating a sample include the use of needles, for example during blood sampling, as well as biopsies of various tissues, blistering techniques and laser poration. Due to the invasive nature of these techniques there is an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Further, invasive techniques can inadvertently impact the state of the skin, which could lead to inaccurate or false results. Even further, invasive techniques are difficult to execute on a large population. The invasive technique may result is discomfort to the participant and may provide a greater potential for infection or other side effects. The present invention provides a non-invasive method for measuring histamine from the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term &#x201c;objectively&#x201d; means without bias or prejudice. Alternatively, any expert or self-assessments are inherently &#x201c;subjective.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;normalization&#x201d; and/or &#x2018;normalized&#x201d; means the degree to which a population of itch sufferers approach a state of non-itch, or normal, population.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The term &#x201c;standardization&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;standardized&#x201d; means histamine values expressed relative to the amount of protein measured on the corresponding adhesive or adhesive article. A non-limiting example would be ng histamine/&#x3bc;g soluble protein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The term &#x201c;baseline&#x201d; means information gathered at the beginning of a study from which variations found in the study are measured.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a further embodiment of the present invention, there are a number of Alternative &#x201c;Non-Invasive&#x201d; Sampling Methods that may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Sebutape&#x2122;: This is a noninvasive approach in that Sebutape&#x2122; (acrylic polymer film; CuDerm; Dallas, Tex.) is only very mildly adhesive and may be applied to and removed from even visibly inflamed skin without causing discomfort. Biomarkers recovered/assayed by this technique have included proteins (e.g., cytokines), peptides (e.g., neuropeptides), and small molecule (e.g., nitric oxide) mediators. Historically, this tape is manufactured and sold for sebum collection and can, therefore, be useful for lipid analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">D-Squame&#xae;: D-Squame&#xae; tape is a polyacrylate ester adhesive also manufactured by CuDerm. It may be used to recover the same biomarkers as Sebutape&#x2122; but also removes certain epidermal structural proteins (e.g., keratins, involucrin). It has also been used to recover cortisol and serum albumin as systemic inflammatory markers, small molecules and stratum corneum lipids.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Cup Scrubs: Cup scrubs extract proteins directly from the surface of the skin, usually in the presence of buffer and a nonionic surfactant. Cup scrubs are primarily used for recovery of soluble biomarkers such as cytokines, but can also be used to recover small organic molecules. Many more cytokines can be recovered and quantified from cup scrubs than from tape strips. This could be due to several reasons. (a) Due to the presence of detergents and their liquid nature, cup scrubs most likely sample a different protein population than do tape strips. (b) With cup scrubs, cytokines do not have to be further extracted after sample collection since they already are in solution.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Animal (i.e. Dog) Collection Method: D-Squame&#xae;: D-Squame&#x2122; tape samples are collected on dogs' skin via parting their fur (without shaving). A variety of biomarkers related to skin inflammation, differentiation and barrier integrity can be analyzed from the tapes including total protein, soluble protein, skin multiple analyte profile (skin MAP), skin cytokines and stratum corneum lipids (ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an embodiment of the present invention, the present invention provides a method and analysis for non-invasively obtaining a sample for use in isolating histamine</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment, the use of an adhesive device can be used to achieve such sampling. In preparation for such a sampling study for a dandruff sampling, at a baseline visit, a qualified screening grader will complete adherent scalp flaking score (ASFS) grading for each subject and the highest flaking octant will be identified for tape strip sampling. The highest flaking octant will be sampled at baseline and week 3. Tape strips samples will be collected from each subject at each time point (baseline and week 3).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For each subject there will be two tape strip sampling sites both within the same octant (i.e., the highest flaking octant at baseline and week 3) and the scalp is prepared for sampling by appropriate procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The tape strip sampling is repeated additional times, as needed, at the same site placing each D-Squame&#xae; tape disc on top of the prior sampled area. The D-Squame&#xae; tapes after sample collection are placed into the appropriately labeled wells in a labeled plate.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Following the sampling, an extraction and quantitation procedure is conducted. In an embodiment of the present invention, quantitation of Histamine from extracts of D-Squame&#xae; Tape Samples can be conducted using a High Sensitivity Enzyme Immunoassay. (Histamine EIA Kit (US Distributor, Cayman #589651/Histamine EIA kit Manufacture (France), SPbio #A05890)</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this embodiment of the present invention, the sample extraction in preparation for using a Histamine Sensitivity Enzyme assay is: The D-Squame&#xae;<sup> </sup>Tape Samples plates are removed from &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. freezer where they are stored following sample collection, and placed place on dry ice. The tape strips are inserted into pre-labeled polypropylene collection tubes, adhesive side facing inward. Appropriate standard extraction buffers are added to each collection tube and then extracted on ice using sonication for 30 min. Each extract solution is isolated from the tape strip and an aliquot of each sample is placed into a specified position of a 96-well polypropylene plate. Aliquots of the extracts of D-Squame&#xae; Tape samples are then supplemented with conventional reagents, such as albumin, to help prevent loss of analytes to the walls of labware, transferred into 96-well polypropylene deep well plates and frozen at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for histamine analysis. A separate aliquot is not supplemented with reagents and is analyzed for soluble protein using a BCA&#x2122; Protein Assay Kit, Pierce catalog #23227.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Following the extraction process, histamine standards and controls can be prepared by conventional methods. Histamine will be quantitated with a histamine enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit from SPI-BIO, distributed by the Cayman Chemical Co. A wash buffer, derivatization reagent, Histamine ACHe tracer and Ellman's Reagent can be prepared by conventional methods. Standards, controls and samples are derivatized in a deep well plate. Plates are washed with buffer and standards, blanks, samples and quality controls are added to the plate and are incubated for 24 hours @ 4&#xb0; C. Plates are then washed prior to the addition of Elman's reagent and incubation in the dark at room temperature. Plates can be read via standard spectrophotometry. Data analysis is conducted by standard statistical methods and calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a further embodiment of the present invention, quantization of histamine from extracts of the adhesive article, tape strips, can be conducted using gradient reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Tape strips (single or multiple tape strips) obtained from the scalp of human subjects are placed into individual polypropylene vials, each vial is spiked with a stable isotope-labeled histamine (D<sub>4</sub>-histamine) internal standard (ISTD) and then extracted with acidified water using sonication for 10 min. Each extract solution is isolated from the tape strip and an aliquot of each sample is placed into a specified position of a 96-well polypropylene plate. A set of histamine standards are prepared in the 96-well polypropylene plate over an appropriate calibration range in acidified water and spiked with ISTD. The standards and the extracts of the scalp tape strips are analyzed using gradient reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS). Histamine and the ISTD are monitored by positive ion electrospray (ESI) using the selected-reaction-monitoring schemes shown in Table 1. A standard curve is constructed by plotting the signal, defined here as the peak area ratio (peak area histamine/peak area ISTD), for each standard versus the mass of histamine for the corresponding standard. The mass of histamine in the calibration standards and human scalp extract samples are then back-calculated using the generated regression equation. The result can be reported as the mass of histamine/tape strip or the result can be standardized by dividing by the amount of protein that was also found in the tape strip extract. The protein method has been described separately.</p>

Methodology Extension
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although the exact procedure used is described above, there are a number of alternate approaches that could be taken for a number of the steps outlined above that are logical extensions. The extraction solvent employed for isolating histamine from the tape strip can be any appropriate aqueous, organic or organic/aqueous mixture that provides a suitable recovery of histamine. Although a stable isotope-based separation approach was used, a chemical internal standard or an external standard approach could also be employed. LC/MS/MS is generally recognized as the state-of-the-art approach for the quantitative analysis of small organic molecules in biological matrices due to its high selectivity and sensitivity. However, any analytical technique and or other approach providing the required sensitivity and selectivity could be employed. For example, other separation-based approaches such as gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, electrophoresis have been employed. Gas chromatography with sensitive detection modes (ex. mass spectrometry, electron capture, flame ionization) with or without derivitization have been used for the analysis of histamine. High performance liquid chromatography with UV, electrochemical or fluorescence detection, with or without derivitization, have also been employed. Capillary electrophoresis using a variety of detection systems have been evaluated. Similarly, instrumental approaches without separation techniques have also been employed including mass spectrometry, electrochemical and fluorometric assays. Additionally, ligand binding approaches such competitive and non-competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) or other labeling schemes have also been employed. Enzyme-based assays have a long history of use in the analysis of histamine. Bioassay using either cell-based or tissue based approaches could have also been used as the means of detection. The measurement of histamine metabolites has also been employed to provide an indirect assessment of histamine levels.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Protein Determination of Tape Strip Extracts:</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Histamine levels on tape strip samples of skin measured using a suitable methodology described above can be standardized using amount of protein found in the tape strip extract. Standardization is done by dividing the histamine level by the amount of protein in the tape strip extract.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The amount of protein in the tape strip extract or an equivalent matrix that was used to determine the histamine level on skin can be determined using variety of protein determination methods described in the literature. Examples of such methods include total nitrogen determination, total amino acid determination and protein determination based on any colorimetric, flurometric, luminometric methods. These methods may or may not involve further sample preparation of the tape strip extract prior to protein determination. A non-limiting example of a specific method for protein determination in the tape strip extract is given below. A comprehensive review of protein determination methods, their applicability and limitations are described in the Thermo Scientific Pierce Protein Assay Technical Handbook that can be downloaded from the following link, incorporated by reference herein. www.piercenet.com/Files/1601669_PAssayFINAL_Intl.pdf.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Adhesive tapes sampled from human skin will be extracted and analyzed for protein content using the BCA&#x2122; Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). The tape strips sampled from human skin will be extracted with an acidic extraction solution, Following extraction, aliquots of the tape extracts will be transferred into 96-well polypropylene deep well plates and stored at 2-8&#xb0; C. for protein determination.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The BCA&#x2122; Protein Assay Kit is based on the reduction of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to Cu<sup>1+</sup> by proteins in an alkaline medium coupled with the sensitive and selective colorimetric detection of Cu<sup>+1 </sup>by bicinchoninic acid (BCA). The purple-colored reaction product, formed by chelation of 2 molecules of BCA with one Cu<sup>1+</sup> ion, exhibits strong absorbance at a wavelength of 562 nm. The optical density (OD) is measured using a microplate reader. Increasing concentrations of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), expressed in micrograms per milliliter (&#x3bc;g/mL), are used to generate a calibration curve in the assay. Appropriate assay QC's prepared from the BSA stock solution will be used to monitor assay performance during sample analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, protein determination can be done by direct measurement of protein on an adhesive or an adhesive article such as protein measurement with a SquameScan&#xae; 850A (CuDerm Corporation, Dallas, Tex.).</p>

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Basic Procedure for Histamine Work in Study #1 and Study#2</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Dandruff subjects are identified by a qualified grader in two separate clinical studies; study #1 and study #2. Study #2 also includes non-dandruff subjects who are also evaluated at baseline to establish standardized histamine levels (n=121).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Subjects undergo a two week washout period with a conventional non dandruff shampoo without conditioning agents prior to a treatment period with an antidandruff shampoo. Following a three week treatment period with an antidandruff shampoo (a shampoo composition containing zinc pyrithione), a tape strip sample is collected from highest flaking octant as determined at the baseline visit by qualified grader. Scalp tape strips are taken at baseline and after a three week product treatment. Tapes are kept at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until extracted. A dandruff-involved site is sampled by parting the hair, applying a D-Squame&#xae; tape (CuDerm Corporation), and rubbing the tape, as needed. The tape is placed into a pre-labeled <b>12</b> well culture dish for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In Study #1, a tape from the surface of the scalp is collected and analyzed by an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. In Study #2, a tape that was one tape below the surface of the scalp is collected and analyzed by gradient reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Study #1, samples are extracted with a conventional extraction buffer and sonicated on ice . . . Aliquots of the extracts of DSquame&#xae; Tape samples are then supplemented with conventional reagents, such as albumin, to help prevent loss of analytes to the walls of labware, transferred into 96-well polypropylene deep well plates and frozen at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for histamine analysis. A separate aliquot is not supplemented with reagents and is analyzed for soluble protein using a BCA&#x2122; Protein Assay Kit, Pierce catalog #23227.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Study #2, samples are extracted with an acidified water and an aliquot is placed into a 96-well polypropylene plate plates and frozen at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for histamine analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Study #1, histamine is quantified from extracts of D-Squame&#xae; tape samples using a High Sensitivity Enzyme Immunoassay kit from SPIbio, part#A05890 and following the procedure as outlined above.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Study #2, tape strip samples are analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS method as outlined above.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For both studies, histamine concentrations were reported as measured and also as histamine standardized to the amount of soluble protein in the extract as determined by the BCA protein assay as outlined above. Analysis is conducted at baseline and week 3 samples from the antidandruff shampoo treatment group.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Results Summary</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Statistical Analysis of Histamine Data: Histamine data was collected on dandruff subjects at both baseline and at week 3 (after treatment) and non-dandruff subjects at baseline. Given the wide variability of histamine levels between subjects as well as within subject (baseline-&#x3e;week 3), it is more efficient to transform the histamine data to the log 10 scale before analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out on the equivalent log 10 Ratio values (i.e., log 10(Week 3/Baseline)). Final reported histamine results are then converted back to their original scale (or % change from baseline values), for ease of interpretation. All statistical analyses were carried out using the SAS JMP (Version 7.0.2) software. A p-value of &#x2266;0.10 (one-sided) was used to determine statistical significance.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> demonstrates that in Study 1 there was a 46% reduction in histamine level following treatment with an antidandruff shampoo over a 3-week periods of time. These histamine levels have been divided by the amount of protein in the tape strip extract.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In an embodiment of the present invention, there may be a 46% reduction in standardized histamine following application with an antifungal shampoo, when compared to a baseline level of histamine prior to the application.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> demonstrates that an antidandruff shampoo treatment reduced histamine levels by 46% (study #2) and 45% (study #1) versus baseline (p-values=&#x2266;0.001, 1-sided). These histamine levels have been divided by the amount of protein in the tape strip extract.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> demonstrates that Dandruff histamine levels were significantly higher than non-dandruff levels (p-value=&#x2266;0.0001, 1-sided). Histamine levels on tape strip samples of human scalp measured using a suitable methodology described above can be standardized using amount of protein found in the tape strip extract. Histamine levels were determined from an independent non-dandruff group to establish normal skin histamine levels. Standardization is done by dividing the histamine level by the amount of protein in the tape strip extract. Further this data demonstrates that the antidandruff treatment restored histamine levels to that of the non-dandruff group as discussed above. (1 sided p-value 0.12).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> demonstrates that following antidandruff treatment over a 3-week period of time there was an improved histamine level by 79% relative to that of a non-dandruff group. Alternatively, this data demonstrates a 79% return to a healthy skin state. This is a useful means of communicating the benefit as the dandruff population desires a return to a normalized and/or healthy state. This is calculated by dividing the change in histamine levels from baseline to three weeks by the difference between baseline and non-dandruff levels and multiplying by 100.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In an embodiment of the present invention, there is a 79% improvement in itch compared to a normal population. In a further embodiment of the present invention, there is a 79% return to a normalized skin state.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> demonstrates a highly significant reduction in itch perception over a three week treatment period. This would be a subjective measurement based on self-assessment using a visual analog scale. However, the data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> provides an objective measure that correlates with the perception of itch wherein the histamine measure (in ng/&#x3bc;g protein) directly correlates with the same population of subject's itch perception data on a visual analog scale. This direct correlation has provided an objective measurement for the perception of itch that was not previously known. Subjective measures are commonly used to assess skin conditions and typically involve either expert graders and/or self-assessment. While these types of measures are useful, they are inherently biased by the evaluator. Objective measures do not have an opportunity for bias and therefore represent more rigorous scientific data.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">There may be objective measures of itch which are highly invasive, such as biopsy or blood draw, and thereby have limited use due to the invasive nature of the sampling. Further, there may be low objective measures that are available for measuring itch with low invasive measures, however such measures suffer from being highly subjective. Therefore, the present invention provides a highly objective measure for the perception of itch with low invasiveness which has not been previously known.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an embodiment of the present invention, the method includes an adhesive article being applied to an epithelieum from a subject afflicted with a disease, disorder or inflammatory reaction. In a further embodiment, the method includes an adhesive article being applied to an epithelium from a subject afflicted with dermatitis. In a further embodiment, the method includes an adhesive article being applied to an epithelium from a subject afflicted with dandruff.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an embodiment of the present invention, the histamine level may be reduced from 25% to 100%.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to microfabricated and microfluidic structures. In one example, the present invention relates to a microfabricated system and method for genome sequencing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The genome of an organism is defined by the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or, for some viruses, the RNA (ribonucleic acid) of the organism. Genome sequencing is figuring out the order of the nucleotides, or bases, of a DNA or RNA strand.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A current approach to genome-scale sequencing of DNA is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This shotgun sequencing approach <b>100</b> uses bacterial transformation, selection and growth to manipulate individual genomic DNA fragments. The first three steps of this approach, shearing, vector ligation, and transformation (steps <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b>), need only be performed once. As such, they do not present any particular problems. The last step, the capillary electrophoresis (CE) (step <b>114</b>), has been miniaturized through microfabrication. This has reduced the cost and processing time associated with this step. The plate and grow (step <b>108</b>), and the pick, grow and extract steps (step <b>110</b>), however, are problematic. These steps, which precede the Sanger extension step (step <b>112</b>), perform clone isolation and insert amplification. The amplification may be bacterial, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or RCA (rolling circle amplification). These steps have remained refractory to miniaturization and integration. The current macroscopic paradigm has thus relied upon the use of robotics as the enabling technology for these key steps. However, this is a problem because no less than 30 million colonies must be picked and grown to produce a sequencing template for a genome. Furthermore, the minimum quantities of materials prepared by such robotic technologies are orders of magnitude more than that required by modern microfabricated CE analysis systems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, it is desirable to improve the processing time, volume scale, and level of integration of genome sequencing. It is also desirable to reduce the cost and space requirements of genome sequencing.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Reference will now be made in detail to some specific embodiments of the present invention including the best modes contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention. Examples of these specific embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention is described in conjunction with these specific embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to the described embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. The present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, techniques and mechanisms of the present invention will sometimes be described in singular form for clarity. However, it should be noted that some embodiments can include multiple iterations of a technique or multiple applications of a mechanism unless noted otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The system and method of the present invention will be described in connection with DNA sequencing. However, the system and method may also be used for RNA sequencing. Additionally, the system and method may be used for other genetic analysis of DNA or RNA.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The system and method of the present invention uses microreactor elements such as a microemulsion droplet or a bolus which, in some embodiments, include a microcarrier element such as a microsphere or bead. The microcarrier element, contained within a bolus or a microemulsion droplet, is useful in capturing DNA or RNA products; that is, amplified DNA or RNA can be chemically linked to the microcarrier element. Alternatively, the amplified DNA or RNA may be carried by a microreactor element without the use of a microcarrier element. For instance, a PCR reaction may be done in a bolus or a microemulsion droplet, and then the resulting bolui or microemulsion droplets may be routed to the next step of the process.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A microfabricated integrated DNA analysis system (MINDS) of the present invention provides a system and method that are readily compatible with microfluidic sample component separation devices. As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the MINDS process <b>200</b>, in one embodiment, begins with the shearing of DNA into DNA fragments (step <b>202</b>). The fragments are then ligated to form a mixture of desired circular and contaminating linear products (step <b>204</b>). The contaminating linear products are then selectively removed, for instance, by exonuclease degradation (step <b>206</b>). A colony of microspheres carrying multiple clonal copies of a DNA sequencing template is next formed (step <b>208</b>). The colony may be generated, for example, by emulsion PCR reactions. The microspheres having a DNA sequencing template are then identified (step <b>210</b>). The microspheres may be identified by a fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) technique. Only one such run is required, and it may take 6 hours or less to complete. The microspheres with the DNA sequencing templates are then distributed into thermal cycling or sequencing reaction chambers where extension fragments are produced; thereafter, the fragments are purified and concentrated (step <b>212</b>). The extension fragment are then analyzed by a sample component separation apparatus, for example, a CE device (step <b>214</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The MINDS method, process, and apparatus, in one embodiment, comprises a microfabricated structure on which thermal cycling, affinity capture, sample purification, and capillary array electrophoresis (CAE) components are integrated. As will be discussed, such a system includes a microfluidic distribution channel to distribute microspheres carrying multiple copies of a sequencing template into a plurality of thermal cycling or sequencing reaction chambers. An autovalve may be located at an exit port of the thermal cycling chambers to ensure that only one microsphere will flow into each chamber wherein thermal cycling extension fragments are produced from the microsphere. Purification chambers are connected to the thermal cycling chambers to capture, purify, and concentrate the extension fragments. Microfabricated CE separation channels are connected to the purification chambers to analyze the extension fragments.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present invention eliminates the laborious, expensive, and time consuming in vivo cloning, selection, colony isolation, and amplification steps of conventional sequencing. Instead, these steps are replaced with readily miniaturized and automated in vitro steps.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Microspheres are ideal carriers, providing flexible control over size, surface, fluorescent, and magnetic properties. Miniaturization of a sequencing reaction chamber through microfabrication and the concomitant reduction in reagent volume makes possible the use of a single, clonal microsphere as a carrier for sufficient DNA sequencing template. This enables the use of a matched process flow that permits selection, amplification and sorting of clonal templates for direct integration with a nanoliter extension, clean-up and sequencing process.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides an overview of a cloning process <b>300</b> that may be used with the MINDS. The process includes library creation and selection. In one embodiment, genomic DNA is isolated from whole blood and then sheared in a nebulizer generating DNA fragments (steps <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>). The DNA fragments are then subjected to an enzymatic treatment to yield blunt-end DNA (step <b>306</b>). Processed fragments are ligated into a vector yielding a mixture of desired circular and contaminating linear products (steps <b>308</b> and <b>310</b>). Exonuclease degredation then selectively removes the insert and vector, the contaminating linear products, from the ligation product so that greater than about 95% of the remaining vectors contain inserts, the desired circular products (step <b>312</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first five steps of the cloning process <b>300</b> (steps <b>302</b>-<b>310</b>) follow standard library creation procedures. More specifically, Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) supplies a TOPO Subcloning Kit (#K7000-01) which is capable of generating a 1 to 6 Kb insert genomic shotgun library in two hours. The subcloing kit requires about 20 micrograms (&#x3bc;g) of genomic DNA that can be obtained from 1 mL of whole blood using Qiagen's (Oslo, Norway) Blood &#x26; Cell Culture DNA Mini Kit (#13323). The DNA is sheared in a nebulizer generating 1-6 Kb DNA fragments. The fragments are then subjected to an enzymatic treatment with T4 DNA and Klenow polymerases and calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) to yield dephosphorylated blunt-end DNA. Processed fragments are next ligated into Invitrogen's pCR 4 Blunt-TOPO vector. Use of covalently linked vaccinia virus topoisomerase Ito the cloning vector results in rapid and efficient ligation (a 5 minute room temperature ligation yields greater than 95% transformants) and permits dephosphorylation of the inserts prior to ligation thereby preventing chimeric clone formation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The final step in canonical library creation (step <b>312</b>), which has been modified to be compatible with the in vitro MINDS process, is bacterial transformation and antibiotic selection. Exonuclease degredation selectively removes insert and vector from the desired ligation product. Lambda exonuclease (New England BioLabs #M0262S) can be used for this step as it degrades 5&#x2032;-phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated double-stranded DNA but is unable to initiate DNA digestion at the nicks present in the vector after ligation. Assuming a pessimistic 1% recovery of the starting genomic DNA, the resulting library contains greater than 6,000 fold molecular excess needed for 10&#xd7;sequence coverage, though this excess is reduced through dilution in the single-molecule PCR amplification step described later.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A gel separation and band purification step can be performed after DNA shearing (step <b>304</b>) if strict control over insert size is required for paired-end whole-genome de novo sequencing. Alternatively, insert size can be restricted using limiting extension times during PCR amplification or flow cytometric selection of microspheres within a narrow fluorescence intensity range. Labeling microsphere-clones with an intercalating dye, such as thiazole orange (TO), will yield a fluorescent signal proportional to amplicon size. Since flow cytometry is a step in the MINDS process, this is an appealing size-selection method that also eliminates the &#x3e;5% recircularized vectors with the only drawback being reduced yield.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The vector used in the subcloning kit may be optimized for sequencing with the T7 and T3 priming sites 33 by (base pairs) away from the insertion site. Since the MINDS vector is free from biological constraints, the sequencing priming sites can be moved closer to the insert site and the pUC ori, fl ori, lacZ, and antibiotic resistance genes can be removed. Optimized acrydite capture sequences and homo-PCR priming sites can be inserted for improved sample clean-up and reduced primer-dimer formation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Sequencing in the MINDS process may use clonal template DNA attached to individual microspheres or beads. The clonal attachment is accomplished by linking one of the primers covalently to a microsphere.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Clonal isolation of 1,000 to 100,000 DNA molecules through single-molecule amplification (for example microemulsion polonies) or combinatorial hybridization approaches has been demonstrated. See, Mitra, R. D., et al., &#x201c;Digital genotyping and haplotyping with plymearase colonies&#x201d;, <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, </i>2003, 100(10): p. 5926-5931; Dressman, D., et al., &#x201c;Transforming single DNA molecules into fluorescent magnetic particles for detection and enumeration of genetic variations&#x201d;, <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, </i>2003, 100(15): p. 8817-8822; and Brenner, S., et al., &#x201c;Gene expression and analysis by massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) on microbead arrays&#x201d;, <i>Nature Biotechnology, </i>2000, 18(6): p. 630-634; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Conventional microchip sequencing requires approximately 1 billion template DNA molecules per reaction. Twenty billion extension fragments have been generated after 20&#xd7; linear Sanger-sequencing amplification, representing a 20-fold excess for high signal-to-noise (S/N) detection using a confocal radial scanner (1 million fragments per band X 1,000 bands=1 billion molecules). This excess is necessary because a cross-injection process requires streaming extension fragments across the separation column until an equimolar mixture is obtained at the intersection and then injecting about 5% of the total sample. An affinity capture direct-injection strategy discussed below eliminates the 20-fold excess requiring only 50 million initial template copies.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">CPG Biotech (Lincoln Park, N.J.) produces a 5 micron (&#x3bc;m) controlled pore glass paramagnetic microsphere with a long chain alkylamine linker for covalent attachment to an amine modified primer that can consistently bind 80 million DNA molecules. Starting from a single DNA molecule, 30 cycles of PCR has a theoretical gain of 1 billion. In practice, the gain is lower due to less than 100% efficiency for each cycle, reduced enzyme activity in later cycles, and limiting reagents in pL scale reactions. To generate clonal microspheres, a single DNA molecule and a single primer-coupled microsphere must be placed in a PCR reactor. Efficient single-molecule PCR requires extremely small volume reactors (1-10 pL) to increase the effective concentration of a single DNA molecule. Approximately 30 million microsphere clones are needed to sequence a human-size genome. High-throughput combination of a single microsphere and DNA molecule in a chamber is possible using statistically dilute microemulsion solutions. If the DNA molecules and microspheres are each diluted such that one species is present in 10 times the reactor volume, there is a high probability (greater than 99%) of concurrence in 1% of the reactors. Because 99% of the reactors are non-productive, 100-fold more reactions (3 billion) are required to generate 30 million microsphere clones.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Two possible approaches for generating large numbers of small volume reactions are microfabricated PCR devices and emulsion PCR. PCR devices, however, require thousands of runs to achieve the required 3 billion reactions. Emulsion PCR, on the other hand, has the ability to thermally cycle millions to billions of separate compartments in a single tube using a conventional thermal cycler. Clonal PCR amplicons attached to magnetic particles using emulsion PCR have been produced. On average, each microsphere contained greater than 10,000 250 by amplicons, a value below the theoretical maximum of 600,000 amplicons based on the available nucleoside triphosphates in each 5 &#x3bc;m diameter compartment. Fifteen micron microemulsion PCR compartments have been demonstrated in which the maximum number of 1,000 by amplicons is 5 million- a value ten times less than the minimum required 50 million initial template copies. This problem may be solved in a variety of ways:</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">First, additional microemulsion PCR steps could be performed to increase the amount of DNA linked to the beads. Second, an additional non-reagent-limited amplification step may be necessary after the fluorescence flow cytometry step. Secondary PCR amplification can be performed in an on-chip, dual-use thermal cycling chamber in which paramagnetic microspheres are routed to individual reactors and magnetically retained. Fresh PCR mix is passed into the chambers and thermal cycled 15&#xd7; to saturate each microsphere to the maximum of 80 million templates. In this case, the magnetic field is maintained as Sanger-sequencing reaction mix is washed into the chambers followed by solid-phase sequencing. Finally, the S/N of the scanner may be improved up to 10-fold enabling sequencing of about a 10-fold lower template than calculated above.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Approximately 15 million 15 &#x3bc;m diameter compartments may be created in a 25 &#x3bc;L aqueous phase, 75 &#x3bc;L oil phase emulsion. Three billion compartments are required to generate 30 million coincident single DNA molecule and microsphere events. Thus, approximately two 100 &#x3bc;L 96-well plate reactions are required. When the reactions are complete, 30 million microsphere clones must be separated from a background of 300 million un-labeled microspheres.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As noted, the beads having sequencing templates may be identified by FACS. A system that may be used is the BD FACS ArrayBioanalyzer System, available from BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif. The BD FACSArray flow cytometer can process up to 15,000 events per second, enabling the isolation of all clones needed for 10&#xd7; coverage of a 3 billion base genome in less than 6 hours. The beads will be treated with an intercalation dye, such as TO, that is nonfluorescent until intercalated into double-stranded DNA. The fluorescence intensity of TO is linearly proportional to the amount of DNA allowing for easy differentiation between beads that have amplified DNA and those that do not.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A diagrammatic representation of a single-channel microdevice 400 in accordance with the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, and <b>4</b>C. The device may be fabricated as a four layer glass-glass-PDMS (polydimethysiloxane)-glass sandwich that incorporates microfluidic valves, heaters, resistive temperature detectors (RTDs), and all reaction, capture and clean-up, and CE structures. The device, in another configuration, may be fabricated as a glass-PDMS-glass-glass stack. A four layer microfabricated system including valves, heaters, RTDs, chambers, and CE structures is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/750,533, filed Dec. 29, 2003, entitled &#x201c;Fluid Control Structures In Microfluidic Devices&#x201d;, assigned to the Assignee of the subject application, and which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The microdevice <b>400</b> is capable of performing all down-stream steps in the MINDS process including extension fragment production, reaction clean-up, and extension fragment separation (steps <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The device <b>400</b> includes a thermal cycling or sequencing reaction chamber <b>402</b>, a capture or purification chamber <b>404</b>, and a CE system <b>406</b> including separation channels <b>407</b>. As shown, these components of the device <b>400</b> are connected by various valves and channels. A heater (not shown), for example, a kapton heater, may be used to heat the contents of the thermal cycling chamber. The template of the chamber is monitored by RTDs <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the device <b>400</b> includes three glass layers, including a channel layer <b>430</b>, a via layer <b>432</b>, and a manifold layer <b>434</b>. A PDMS membrane layer <b>436</b> is provided between the via layer <b>432</b> and the manifold layer <b>434</b>. The top layer <b>430</b> contains the thermal cycling reactors, the capture chambers and the CE features. The second layer <b>432</b> incorporates the RTDs on the top surface of the glass wafer and etched features on the bottom to form the valves and pumps with the membrane layer <b>436</b> below. The last layer <b>434</b> includes the heater, and completes the valve and pump structures with pneumatic actuation lines and displacement chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one method of operation, a sequencing master mix is loaded from a port <b>408</b> of the device <b>400</b> through a microvalve <b>410</b> into the thermal cycling chamber <b>402</b>. The volume of the chamber <b>402</b> may be approximately 250 nano-liters (nL). The separation channels of the CE system <b>406</b> are filled with linear polyacrylimide from a port <b>412</b> to a port <b>414</b>. The CE system may be a 16-centimeter (cm) hyperturn system. An acrydite capture matrix is loaded from a port <b>416</b> to a port <b>418</b> to fill the capture chamber <b>404</b> and an intervening pinched chamber <b>419</b>. After thermal cycling the chamber <b>402</b>, extension fragments and residual reactants are electrokinetically driven through a valve <b>420</b> and a channel <b>422</b> into the capture chamber <b>404</b>. The captured extension fragments are then electrophoretically washed and injected into a channel <b>424</b> for separation by the CE system <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">An advantage of this affinity capture, sample clean-up microdevice is that purified extension fragments may be retained in 1-10 nL at a concentration determined by the quantity of the acrydite monomer added during synthesis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</figref>, <b>5</b>B, and <b>5</b>C display fluorescence images (where relative applied potentials are indicated by &#x201c;+&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d;) from the operation of a microdevice <b>500</b> like that of the device <b>400</b> where thermal cycling, capture, wash (purification), and concentration of a sample as well as separation were performed. Specifically, an acrydite capture matrix was synthesized in a 2-mL solution of 5% w/v acrylamide, 1&#xd7; TTE (50 mM Tris, 50 mM TAPS free acid, 1 mM EDTA, pH=8.4), and 20 nmol of the methacrylate-modified oligo (5&#x2032;-Acrydite-ACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAA-3&#x2032; (SEQ. ID NO. 1), TM=60.4 C, Operon Technologies, Emeryville, Calif.). The solution was sparged with argon for 2 hours prior to adding 0.015% w/v APS and TEMED to initiate polymerization. The polymerized capture matrix was then loaded into a capture chamber <b>504</b> using a 1 mL syringe. A polymer sequencing matrix (CEQ, Beckman Corp., Fullerton, Calif.) was loaded into a CE system <b>506</b> using a high-pressure gel loader. A C-track master mix was prepared containing 80 nM ET-primer, 1&#xd7; C terminator mix (Amersham), and 4 nM PCR product and injected into a 250 nL thermal cycling chamber or reactor (not shown). Thermal cycling (35&#xd7;, 94&#xb0; C. 30 seconds, 45&#xb0; C. 40 seconds, 70&#xb0; C. 40 seconds) was performed on-chip using a LabVIEW program (National Instruments, Austin, Tex.).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Sequencing reaction clean-up was performed by first equilibrating the microdevice on a 50&#xb0; C. heated stage for 30 seconds. Then, sample capture (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) was initiated by applying 2000 V to the capture chamber outlet (port <b>416</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) while grounding the reactor inlet (port <b>408</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). Thus, the sample containing extension fragments and residual nucleotides, primers, and salts was electrophoretically driven from the thermal cycling chamber through a channel <b>522</b> into the capture chamber <b>504</b>. Extension fragments hybridize to the Acrydite matrix in the capture chamber while residual reactants pass through. When oligonucleotide capture was complete, the retained extension fragments were electrophoretically washed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) for 30 seconds to remove excess primer and other contaminants still present in the capture chamber. After electrophoretic washing, the stage was ramped to 70&#xb0; C. and equilibrated for 60 seconds to allow full denaturation of the product-matrix duplex. The denatured sample is directly injected into separation columns <b>507</b> of the CE apparatus <b>506</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>) by applying 2,500 V to the anode while grounding the capture chamber outlet. (Images have been processed to highlight channel structure and remove fluorescent surface contamination.)</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Alternatively, a straight cross-injector and a 30-cm separation capillary could be used. This will improve resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The microsphere-colony creation procedure and a single reactor microdevice can generate single-ended reads suitable for resequencing efforts. De novo whole-genome shotgun sequencing of complex genomes requires paired-end reads from short and long insert clones. Long-range PCR followed by fluorescent flow cytometry can be used on a subset of microspheres to selectively generate long-insert clones. Traditional paired-end sequencing requires procedural and microdevice modifications such that clonal DNA could be released from the microspheres and routed to separate forward and reverse sequencing reactors. An alternative strategy is to perform forward and reverse sequencing simultaneously on a subset of bases using an altered base labeling scheme. These paired-end reads generate long single or double-base reads suitable for anchoring four-base single-ended reads in the sequence assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C, a microsphere <b>600</b> is used to transfer a clonal template into a thermal cycling or sequencing reaction chamber <b>602</b> where sequencing reactions are performed. This process requires that one microsphere be introduced in each sequencing reaction chamber. Autovalving techniques for trapping an individual microsphere in a sequencing reaction chamber, without the need for individually actuated valves and sensing, are used for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown, the reaction chamber <b>602</b> includes an introduction channel or arm <b>604</b> and an exit channel or arm <b>606</b>. The introduction channel is in fluid communication with an inlet port <b>605</b> of the reaction chamber, while the exit channel is in fluid communication with an outlet port <b>607</b> of the reaction chamber. Self-valving is achieved by creating a constriction or constriction region <b>608</b> at the outlet end or port <b>607</b> of the reaction chamber. The constriction region is semicircular in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The constriction will trap a microsphere before it exits the chamber. The trapped microsphere will produce a drop in the flow rate, thereby preventing any further microspheres from flowing into the chamber. The dilution of the microspheres will be chosen such that the probability that another microsphere flows into the reaction chamber before the first microsphere has blocked the chamber is below about 0.5%. If this statistical approach is unreliable or leads to low sorting rates, an on-chip sensor for bead light scattering can be used, and two valves in the sorting loop can be added to produce a more temporally uniform bead distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Glass fabrication processes can be used to create the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>. In one example, all features except the constriction were isotropically etched to a depth of 30 &#x3bc;m. The sample introduction and exit channels were set to 70 &#x3bc;m in width and 15 mm in length. The sequencing reaction chamber had a volume of 250 nL. After the basic fabrication process was completed for the channels and the reaction chamber, a second mask was used to fabricate the constriction. For this, a more viscous photoresist (SJR 5740, Shipley, Marlborough, Mass.) was spin-coated on a wafer at 2500 rpm for 35 seconds. This was followed by a soft bake at 70&#xb0; C. for 7 minutes and 90&#xb0; C. for 6 minutes. A higher viscosity photoresist gives more uniform coating on the featured wafer. The constriction pattern was transferred to the coated wafer using a contact printer. Alignment marks were used to align (&#xb1;1 &#x3bc;m) the constriction with the already etched channels and chamber. After development, the amorphous silicon masking layer was removed via plasma etching, and the exposed glass was wet etched using 5:1BHF with an effective etch rate of 2 &#x3bc;m/hour for 1.5 hours. This gave a constriction depth or height of 3 &#x3bc;m. The constriction width was set to 8 &#x3bc;m and the length was set to 15 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Testing of the self-valving concept was performed using 6 &#x3bc;m diameter, Streptavidin Coated Fluoresbrite YG Carboxylated Polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, Pa.) suspended in a solution of 1&#xd7; Tris (pH 8.0) and 1% Triton X-100 diluted to a final concentration of 1 microsphere/3 &#x3bc;L. Using the Poisson distribution, it was calculated that a 10&#xd7; dilution of the reaction chamber volume will insure that the probability that another microsphere will enter the 250 nL chamber before the first microsphere blocks the constriction is below 0.5%.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A device like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref> was pre-filled with a solution of 1&#xd7; Tris (pH 8.0) and 1% Triton X-100. The microsphere solution (6 &#x3bc;L) was pipetted into an inlet access hole. A vacuum line was used to draw the beads through the chamber. The pressure drop increased from &#x2212;60 kPa to &#x2212;70 kPa when a microsphere was trapped at the constriction, and blockage occurred within the first 60 seconds. The experiment was continued for 12 minutes and no other microsphere was observed to enter the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> show bright field images of a constriction region <b>708</b> of a thermal cycling chamber <b>702</b> at 20&#xd7; magnification when empty and with solution (but no microsphere), respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> shows a dark field image of the thermal cycling chamber <b>702</b> with a fluorescent microsphere <b>700</b> trapped at the constriction <b>708</b> and acting as a valve. The experiments were performed for microspheres of approximately 6 &#x3bc;m diameter. The concept is easily scalable to larger microspheres to increase the number of templates in the reactor. Also, smaller microsphere could be used. The microspheres, in particular, may be between about 1 and 100 &#x3bc;m in diameter. In one embodiment, they are about 10 &#x3bc;m in diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">An alternative autovalving embodiment, which will result in complete flow blockage, is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>. Here, a reaction chamber <b>802</b> has a near circular constriction or constriction region <b>808</b> formed at a chamber outlet port <b>807</b>. The chamber and the constriction will be double-etched; that is, they will be etched on both of two joined glass surfaces. This will produce a near circular constriction, as opposed to a semicircular constriction of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>. This will provide better valving for trapping a microsphere <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As discussed, valves will be incorporated on either side of a sequencing reaction or thermal cycling chamber <b>402</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>). Once a microsphere has been trapped at the constriction, it needs to be pushed back into the chamber for thermal cycling so that there is good accessibility of the clonal templates to the polymerase, primers, dNTPs and ddNTPs. By closing the valve <b>420</b> at the outlet of the chamber before closing the inlet valve <b>410</b>, the microsphere will be pushed back into the chamber as a result of the finite dead volume of the valves. This principle is easily scaled to an array system by actuating the inlet and outlet valves in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">To realize a high-throughput and fully integrated system for DNA analysis, a microfabricated array of integrated analyzers that incorporate thermal cycling chambers, purification chambers as well as separation channels for CE analysis of the sequencing fragments is provided. A schematic of such a system <b>900</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. This system extends the single channel device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> to an array structure that is able to perform highly parallel analyses.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to various embodiments, the system <b>900</b> includes multiple thermal cycling chambers <b>902</b> and associated sample purification or capture chambers <b>904</b> arranged about a circular axis to form a radially parallel system. The thermal cycling chambers and the sample purification chambers are all integrated with a CE analyzer system <b>906</b> including separation channels or microchannels <b>908</b>. The CE analyzer has a common central anode (A) <b>910</b>, a cathode reservoir (C) <b>912</b>, and a waste reservoir (W) <b>914</b>. The cathode and anode reservoirs are associated with adjacent sets of separation channels <b>908</b>. The microchannels <b>908</b> are connected to the anode <b>910</b> for detection using a rotary confocal fluorescence scanner of the type discussed in the article entitled: &#x201c;High-throughput genetic analysis using microfabricated 96-sample capillary array electrophoresis microplates&#x201d;, Peter C. Simpson, et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA</i>, Vol. 95, pp. 2256-2261, March 1998, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The system <b>900</b> further includes a distribution channel <b>916</b>, integrated heaters <b>918</b><i>a </i>and <b>918</b><i>b</i>, and RTDs <b>920</b>. The heaters <b>918</b><i>a </i>and <b>918</b><i>b </i>address the thermal cycling chambers and purification chambers, respectively, in parallel. As such, the use of simple ring heaters to drive the thermal cycling and sample purification reactions is more than adequate.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The temperature of these reactions are monitored by the RTDs. In one embodiment, four-equally spaced RTDs are integrated on the substrate to provide precise temperature sensing across the heater <b>918</b><i>a </i>for optimal thermal cycling performance. Similarly, four-equally spaced RTDs may be used to monitor the temperature of the heater <b>918</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The system <b>900</b> also includes an array of integrated valves and ports for controlling the system flow process. The valves may be monolithic elastomer (PDMS) membrane valves. The system may be fabricated as described in the above-identified U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/750,533, which has been incorporated by reference. As such, the system may include a four layer glass-glass-PDMS-glass stack that incorporates the microfluidic valves and pumps, the RTDs, the thermal cycling chambers, the clean-up and concentration chambers, and the CE channels.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The system <b>900</b>, in one embodiment, includes 24 thermal cycling chambers, 24 purification chambers, and 24 CE channels arranged on a quadrant of a 150-mm diameter glass substrate. Each thermal cycling chamber (&#x2dc;250 nL) is isolated from the distribution channel by PDMS membrane valves (V<b>1</b>) <b>922</b>. Rigid containment of the chamber volume with active valves is necessary for bubble-free loading and immobilization of a sample during thermal cycling since sample movement, bubble formation, and sample evaporation can seriously affect the performance.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The RTDs may be fabricated of titanium (Ti) and platinum (Pt). Different materials (Au, Al, Pt, Ni) using different metal deposition techniques, such as sputtering and both thermal and electron-beam evaporations, may be used to fabricate the heaters. Nickel heaters exhibit good heating uniformity, have good scratch resistance, show no noticeable degradation of performance even after hundreds of thermal cycles, and are easily fabricated. The microfabricated heaters and the thermal cycling chambers are positioned away from the CE microchannels to avoid evaporation of buffer in the cathode reservoirs and to minimize the heating of the injection region during thermal cycling. The resistive ring heaters can be fabricated on the back side of the bottom wafer to ensure good thermal transfer between the heaters and the chambers. The equally-spaced RTDs are integrated on the microplate to provide precise temperature sensing ensuring temperature uniformity across the heaters for optimal performance.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The thermal cycling chambers may be cycled with a LabVIEW program (National Instruments, Austin, Tex.). (LabView VI) Temperature control can be accomplished through a proportion/integration/differentiator (PID) module within the LabVIEW program.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In operation, in one embodiment, a sequencing separation matrix is introduced into the CE separation channels using positive pressure through the anode <b>910</b>. A separation matrix fills the cathode reservoirs <b>912</b> and the waste reservoirs <b>914</b>, as well as arms <b>924</b> connecting the cross-injection point to the associated sample purification chambers. The filling rate can be modulated through adjustment of the widths and lengths of the various interconnecting channels. The cathode and anode reservoirs, and the connecting arms may be filled at the same rate. Water, for example, is loaded from a loading (L) port <b>926</b> connected to the distribution channel <b>916</b> to fill the thermal cycling chambers <b>902</b> and the sample purification chambers <b>904</b> ensuring continuity for subsequent processes. An exit port (E) <b>936</b> is shared by both the thermal cycling chambers <b>902</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A capture gel matrix is loaded into the sample purification chambers through ports (F) <b>928</b>. Libraries of clonal DNA beads that have been sorted and prepared using a FACS unit are loaded from the port <b>926</b> (valves (V<b>1</b>) <b>922</b> and (V<b>2</b>) <b>930</b> open, and valve (V<b>3</b>) <b>932</b> closed) using, for example, a syringe pump. A pressure transducer is employed in the inlet to monitor the head pressure. Auto-valves at the exit ports of the thermal cycling chambers will stop the flow into a chamber once a bead is trapped in the auto-valve as described above. As each auto-valve is filled with a bead in each thermal cycling chamber, the head pressure will continue to increase. In this manner, loading a bead in each thermal cycling chamber is achieved by monitoring the head pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Upon filling the chambers, the valves (V<b>2</b>) <b>930</b> and (V<b>1</b>) <b>922</b> are closed and thermal cycling reactions initiated. Since the beads will be sorted directly in the thermal cycling cocktail, no additional steps are needed before thermal cycling. Alternatively, sorting could be performed in a buffer followed by introduction of the thermal cycling cocktail into the thermally cycling chambers to minimize reagent usage. The heaters <b>918</b><i>a </i>and <b>918</b><i>b</i>, as noted, drive the thermal cycling and sample purification reactions, and the reaction temperatures are monitored by the RTDs <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Thermal cycling products are driven to the purification chambers by applying an electric field across the port (L) <b>926</b> and a sample port or electrical contact point (S) <b>934</b> with the valves (V<b>1</b>) <b>922</b> and (V<b>3</b>) <b>932</b> open. Flushing of the non-captured reagents is performed by applying an electric field between the port (S) <b>934</b> and the port (F) <b>928</b>. Thereafter, the sequencing products are injected from the purification chambers into the associated microchannels <b>908</b> for CE separation, by applying a potential between the port (S) <b>934</b> and the waste reservoir (W) <b>914</b>. The rotary confocal fluorescence scanner is used to detect the sequencing samples. The scanner interrogates the channels sequentially in each rotation of the scanner head.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown, separations of the purified DNA sequencing products are achieved by using cross-injection. Alternatively, direct injection could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In another embodiment, the microemulsion PCR approach of colony formation is replaced by a continuous flow through PCR technique in which bouli or droplets for performing single-molecule PCR amplification of templates are formed and then amplified. The bouli or plugs are formed, for example, by combining an aqueous solution of PCR reagents and dilute template fragments with a hydrophobic solution that acts as a carrier. The bolui produced by this technique will contain statistically a small number of copies of a sequencing template. Ideally the concentration is chosen so that only one in 10 bolui contain a single sequencing template. This mean that only one in 100 will simultaneously contain undesirably two templates. A microsphere or bead carrying one of the primers in the PCR reaction can also be entrained within a bolus or droplet in the process of performing this technique. Thus, a colony may comprise bolui carrying multiple clonal copies of a single sequencing template or bouli having microspheres carrying such copies.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</figref>, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C, a continuous flow through microfabricated PCR system <b>1000</b> includes ports <b>1002</b> and <b>1004</b>. An aqueous solution of microspheres, PCR reagents and template fragments, in one embodiment, is introduced into a &#x201c;T&#x201d;-injector region <b>1006</b> via the port <b>1002</b>, while a hydrophobic carrier solution is introduced into the &#x201c;T&#x201d;-injector region via the port <b>1004</b>. A bolus or droplet <b>1012</b> containing a microsphere is thus formed downstream of the &#x201c;T&#x201d;-injector region.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The system <b>1000</b> further includes an optical sensor <b>1007</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>) located downstream of the &#x201c;T&#x201d;-injector near an input end of a channel <b>1014</b>. The sensor may comprise a focused laser beam and a photodiode to detect off-axis light scattering.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The sensor is configured to select a bolus that contains a bead and to reject bolui with no bead or with more than one bead. A rejected bolus is passed out of the system via a valve <b>1009</b> and a waste port and channel <b>1011</b>. The valve <b>1009</b> may be a four-layer PDMS valve that when open allows a rejected bolus to exit the system via the waste port <b>1011</b>. The valve may be activated via a valve actuation port <b>1013</b>. Since the fluidic resistance of the continuous flow system is so great, no valve is needed in the main channel <b>1014</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The system <b>1000</b> is designed for two-step PCR where the anneal and extend steps are combined. As such, the system includes two temperature zones <b>1008</b> and <b>1010</b> through which droplets <b>1012</b> pass via the flow through channels <b>1014</b>. The device <b>1000</b> includes RTDs <b>1016</b> and associated RTD contact pads <b>1018</b> for monitoring the temperature of the different temperature zones. A bolus and microsphere, after undgergoing two-temperature PCR, exit the system via an exit port <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As discussed, the microsphere can be treated with an intercalation dye, such as TO, that is nonfluorescent until intercalated into double-stranded DNA. Therefore, the microspheres that have amplified DNA can be identified by, for example, the FACS technique after they pass through the port <b>1020</b>. Thereafter, the microspheres are introduced into a distribution channel of a device like the device <b>900</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>). The microspheres that do not have amplified DNA, on the other hand, will be disposed of.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The continuous flow through PCR system <b>1000</b>, in one example, uses nanoliter droplets of PCR reagents suspended in a perfluorohydrocarbon carrier. See, Song, H., et al., &#x201c;A microfluidic system for controlling reaction networks in time&#x201d;, <i>Angewandte Chemie</i>-<i>International Edition </i>42, 768-772 (2003), which is hereby incorporated by reference. Droplets containing microspheres, PCR reagents, and template fragments, separated from one another by an immiscible liquid, are formed at the microfabricated T-injector <b>1006</b>. Thereafter, the droplets flow through the regions <b>1008</b> and <b>1010</b> of the device that are held at anneal-extend-denature temperatures. The lengths of the channels <b>1014</b> in the different temperature zones <b>1008</b> and <b>1010</b> are selected based on required residence times at those temperatures. The cross-section of the channels and the desired flow rates are chosen to achieve stable droplet formation. The parameters of the device may be set to achieve a hot start at the denature temperature for 90 seconds, followed by anneal/extend for 45 seconds with a 1 second auto-extend for 35 cycles and a denature time of 15 seconds. The last 15 cycles may be configured to have a constant anneal/extend time of 80 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The device <b>1000</b> may comprise two 1.1-mm thick by 10-cm diameter borofloat glass wafers. The channels on the patterned wafer may have a D-shape cross-section with a width of about 210 &#x3bc;m and a depth of about 95 &#x3bc;m. On the other wafer, Ti/Pt RTDs may be fabricated for monitoring temperature gradients at different points in the device. Holes may be drilled for accessing the channels, and the two wafers may be thermally bonded to each other to form enclosed channels. The nanoports <b>1002</b> and <b>1004</b> are used to interface the device with micro-liter syringes through PEEK tubing. The glass surface of the channels may be rendered hydrophobic through silanization with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane, based on a procedure published by Srinivasan et al., &#x201c;Alkyltrichlorosilane-based self-assembled monolayer films for stiction reduction in silicon micromachines&#x201d;, <i>Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems </i>7, 252-260 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference. Two syringe pumps may be used to dispense water and a 10:1 mixture of perfluorodecalin (mixture of cis and trans, 95%, Acros Organics, N.J., USA) and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctanol (Acros Organics, N.J., USA) at a flow rate of 0.5 &#x3bc;l/min each. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> shows the droplet formation process at the T-injector at about 1 droplet/s, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref> shows the droplets as they move through the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The technique, in one embodiment, uses microbeads in 10 nL droplets. Throughput is maintained at one in ten droplets containing both a single template molecule and a single bead. The aqueous PCR mix is prepared such that there is one template molecule per 100 nL of mix, corresponding to one molecule for every ten droplets. Also in the PCR mix are microbeads at a concentration of one per 10 nL of mix, corresponding to one bead for every droplet on average. As dictated by the Poisson distribution, 37% of the 10 nL droplets will contain only one microbead, the remaining containing either none or two plus. Each droplet, as discussed, is then optically scanned to determine the number of beads it contains. If the droplet does not contain a single microbead, the valve <b>1009</b> is opened, passing the droplet to waste. Approximately one third of the droplets will contain a single bead and are routed to the main channel; thus, the average flow rate is equal to about 1 droplet every 1.5 s. As such, every droplet in the main channel contains a single microbead, and one in ten also contains a single template molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">At the end of the device <b>1000</b>, the droplets may be collected at the port <b>1020</b> via a standard capillary into a microfuge tube. The droplets are broken through centrifugation. Microbeads are collected and washed in 1&#xd7; TE, again through centrifugation. The microbeads are routed into the thermal cycling chambers of the device <b>900</b> by either autovalving or active valving with on-chip detection. On-chip detection may comprise the use of an optical scanner or a timing arrangement that determines when a microsphere is located adjacent to an inlet of a thermal cycling chamber. The optical scanner, as discussed, may use bead light scattering to determine the location of a microsphere within the distribution channel. The timing arrangement is based on the fact that the fluid in the distribution channel is incompressible. As such, the location of a microsphere within the distribution channel, for instance, adjacent to an inlet of a thermal cycling chamber, can be calculated from the time that the microsphere has been in the distribution channel. This is advantageous because the valved entrances to each of the 96 inputs from the distribution channel, for example, can be actuated by a single pneumatic input. Also the pneumatic input is not actuated until a detected bead is flowed directly opposite a reactor that does not have a bead yet.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">To demonstrate the feasibility of generating sequencing templates using two-temperature PCR, high-temperature primers were designed and tested in a conventional thermal cycler. Two primers, M13<sub>&#x2014;</sub>2T_F-5&#x2032;TTCTGGTGCCGGAAACCAGGCAAAGCGCCA-3&#x2032;(SEQ. ID NO. 2) Tm=70.3&#xb0; C. and M13<sub>&#x2014;</sub>2T_R 5&#x2032;-ACGCGCAGCGTGACCGCTACACTTGCCA-3&#x2032; (SEQ. ID NO. 3) Tm=70.7&#xb0; C. were designed to generate a 943 by amplicon from the M13 genome. To approximate the concentration of a single template molecule in a 11 nL emulsion compartment, 18.75 femtograms of M13 template were cycled in a 25 uL PCR reaction (94&#xb0; C. 1.5 min followed by 50 cycles of 94&#xb0; C. 10 s, 70&#xb0; C. 30 s with an auto-extend of 1 s/cycle). The resulting amplicon was a single clean peak at the expected size with a yield of about 40 ng/uL.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">If such a system is used to amplify genomic DNA, for 1&#xd7; coverage and average fragment size of 1000 bps, about 3 million fragments need to be amplified. The probability that two different fragments end up in a single droplet can be reduced to less than 0.01 by diluting the fragments in the PCR reagent such that on an average one in ten droplets contains a fragment. Hence, the system will have to process 30 million droplets. This device is designed to generate one droplet about every 1.5 seconds. If 20 such devices are run in parallel, the entire genome can be amplified and interfaced with a bank of the sequencing systems 900 to produce 1&#xd7; coverage in only one month.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific embodiments, it will also be understood by those skilled in the art that changes in the form and details of the disclosed embodiments may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a manufacturing method of a semiconductor device. Note that in this specification, a semiconductor device refers to devices in general that function by utilizing a semiconductor characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, manufacturing of semiconductor devices that utilize thin film transistors as switching elements, in which the thin film transistors (hereinafter also referred to as a &#x201c;TFT&#x201d;) are formed over substrates having insulating surfaces, such as glass, has been actively pursued. In the thin film transistor, an island-shaped semiconductor layer is formed over a substrate that has an insulating surface, and a portion of the island-shaped semiconductor layer is used as a channel-forming region of the transistor.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">However, with a thin film transistor that has an island-shaped semiconductor layer, there is concern of various defects occurring at an end portion of the semiconductor layer. For example, when the semiconductor layer is formed in an island shape, a step is formed at an end portion of the semiconductor layer, and coverage by a gate insulating film tends to be poor at the end portion of the semiconductor layer. For example, at the end portion of the island-shaped semiconductor layer, there is a case where the gate insulating film becomes thin locally. In a case where the end portion of the island-shaped semiconductor layer cannot be covered sufficiently by the gate insulating film, there is concern of a short circuit occurring between a conductive layer that serves as a gate electrode and the semiconductor layer, or a leak current occurring. Particularly in recent years, reduction in film thickness of gate insulating films is desired in order to reduce power consumption of thin film transistors as well as improve operation speed thereof, and when a gate insulating film is provided to be thin, a defect in coverage of an end portion of a semiconductor layer becomes an even more pronounced problem.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">Further, at an end portion of an island-shaped semiconductor layer, particularly a region in which a conductive layer that serves as a gate electrode and the semiconductor layer overlap, an electric field concentrates easily at the end portion (corner portion). When an electric field concentrates, there is a problem of a leak current occurring due to dielectric breakdown or the like of the gate insulating film, formed between the conductive layer that serves as a gate electrode and the semiconductor layer. In addition, the defect in coverage by the gate insulating film also leads to electrostatic discharge (ESD) or the like of an element or the gate insulating film, and causes yield reduction in manufacturing a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">When a problem such as the above that stems from an end portion of a semiconductor layer occurs, an operational characteristic of a thin film transistor becomes degraded and reliability also decreases. Further, in manufacturing a semiconductor device, yield also decreases. In view of these problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device with a novel structure with improved reliability, and a manufacturing method thereof.</p>

Note that in this specification, a plasma treatment includes in its category an oxidation treatment, a nitridation treatment, an oxynitridation treatment, and a surface modification treatment each using plasma, which is performed on a substrate, a semiconductor layer, an insulating film, or a conductive film.</p>

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(Embodiment Mode 1)</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">Embodiment modes of the present invention will be explained below with reference to the drawings. However, it is to be easily understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to the description below and the modes and details of the present invention can be changed in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to the description of the embodiment modes below. Note that in the following description of the present invention, reference numerals denoting identical portions may be used in common in different drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment Mode 1</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> are a top view and cross-sectional views for describing a main structure of a semiconductor device according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> shows a structure of a thin film transistor in particular, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows the top view, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a cross-sectional view across a dashed line O-P in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows a cross-sectional view across a dashed line Q-R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a thin film or the like is partially omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">A thin film transistor <b>113</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> includes a semiconductor layer <b>103</b> provided in an island shape over a substrate <b>101</b> with an insulating film <b>102</b><i>a </i>and an insulating film <b>102</b><i>b </i>interposed therebetween; an insulating film <b>104</b> and an insulating film <b>105</b> formed over the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, a conductive layer <b>106</b> that serves as a gate electrode that is provided over the insulating film <b>104</b> and the insulating film <b>105</b>; and conductive layers <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>each serving as a source electrode or a drain electrode that are provided through an insulating film <b>107</b> and an insulating film <b>108</b> over the conductive layer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>, upper end portions of a cross-section of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> are formed to have curvature. Further, upper end portions of the insulating films <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> provided over the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> are also formed to have curvature. By providing curvature in the cross-sectional upper end portions of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, coverage by the insulating films <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> at the end portions of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be good. Consequently, a defect stemming from a defect in coverage by the insulating films <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> at the end portions of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, for example, a short circuit of the semiconductor layer and the gate insulating film, occurrence of a leak current, electrostatic breakdown, or the like can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">For the substrate <b>101</b>, a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, a sapphire substrate, a ceramic substrate, a metal substrate with an insulating film formed on a surface, or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">The semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is formed over the substrate <b>101</b>. The insulating film <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the insulating film <b>102</b><i>b </i>serving as a base insulating film may be provided between the substrate <b>101</b> and the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>. The base insulating film prevents contamination of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> that is caused by diffusion of an impurity such as an alkali metal from the substrate <b>101</b>, and may be provided as a blocking layer as appropriate. Further, the base insulating film may be provided as a film that smoothes a surface of the substrate <b>101</b> when the surface has asperity.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">The insulating films <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>are formed using silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, or the like. Further, in this embodiment mode, although the base insulating film has a two-layer stacked-layer structure of the insulating films <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b</i>, a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure with three or more layers may be employed. For example, as shown in this embodiment mode, in the case of a stacked-layer structure with two layers, a silicon nitride oxide layer can be formed as a first layer and a silicon oxynitride layer can be formed as a second layer. Further, a silicon nitride layer may be formed as the first layer and a silicon oxide layer may be formed as the second layer.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">The semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is formed in an island shape. A variety of semiconductors can be used for the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, such as an amorphous semiconductor, a crystalline semiconductor, a polycrystalline semiconductor, or a microcrystalline semiconductor. Specifically, a semiconductor material such as silicon, germanium, or silicon-germanium can be used to form the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>. The semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is formed to have a film thickness in the range of 10 nm to 150 nm inclusive, preferably 10 nm to 100 nm inclusive, and more preferably 10 nm to 30 nm inclusive.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">By forming the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> to be a thin film of 50 nm or thinner, a TFT can be even more miniaturized. Further, even in a case of increasing an amount of the impurity element for doping the channel-forming region in order to make a threshold voltage of the TFT small, since manufacturing of a fully-depleted TFT is made easier by forming the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> as a thin film, a TFT with a small S value and a low threshold voltage can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">The semiconductor layer <b>103</b> includes a channel-forming region <b>111</b> and impurity regions <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>each serving as a source region or a drain region. An impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added to each of the impurity regions <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b</i>. Further, an impurity element imparting one conductivity type for controlling a threshold voltage of a transistor may be added to the channel-forming region <b>111</b>. The channel-forming region <b>111</b> is formed in a region that roughly matches a location of the conductive layer <b>106</b> with the insulating film <b>104</b> and the insulating film <b>105</b> formed therebetween, and is also located between the impurity regions <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">In addition, a low-concentration impurity region that serves as a lightly doped drain (LDD) region may be formed in the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>. The low-concentration impurity region can be formed between the channel-forming region <b>111</b> and the impurity regions <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>each serving as a source region or a drain region. Note that the low-concentration impurity region is to have a lower impurity concentration compared to those of the impurity regions <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>each serving as a source region or a drain region.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">The insulating film <b>104</b> is formed to be in contact with the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, and the insulating film <b>105</b> is formed over the insulating film <b>104</b>. In addition, the conductive layer <b>106</b> is formed over the insulating film <b>104</b> and the insulating film <b>105</b>. The insulating film <b>104</b> and the insulating film <b>105</b> serve as a gate insulating film of the thin film transistor <b>113</b>. That is, a gate insulating film according to the present invention can be formed as a single-layer structure or as a stacked-layer structure of two layers or more. Note that a border between the plurality of insulating films does not have to be clear.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">As described above, when the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is formed in an island shape, various defects stemming from the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> occurs easily. For example, at an end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> that overlaps with the gate electrode, and at an end portion of the channel-forming region <b>111</b> formed in the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> where the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> overlaps with the gate electrode (around borders between the channel-forming region <b>111</b> and the impurity regions <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>each serving as a source region or a drain region), the defects easily occur and are easily effected by electrostatic breakdown, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">As causes of the defects, the following can be given. In a region where an end portion of the channel-forming region <b>111</b> and the gate electrode overlap, a parasitic channel is easily formed through the gate insulating film that is in contact with a side surface of the end portion of the channel-forming region <b>111</b> (end portion of the semiconductor layer); a high voltage is applied to regions of the end portion of the channel-forming region <b>111</b> around the borders with the impurity regions <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>each serving as a source region or a drain region compared to around the center of the channel-forming region <b>111</b>; there is an effect of etching or the like that is performed in processing the gate electrode (conductive layer) formed in a layer above; and the gate insulating film is locally thin at the end portions of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">Therefore, by the end portions of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> having curvature and having good coverage by the insulating layers <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> that serve as the gate insulating film, defects stemming from poor coverage by the insulating film at the end portions of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, for example, a short circuit between the semiconductor layer and the gate electrode, occurrence of a leak current, electrostatic breakdown, or the like can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">In this specification, an &#x201c;end portion&#x201d; of the semiconductor layer refers to a rim portion (edge portion) of a semiconductor layer formed in an island shape.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">When the thickness of the island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is t (t&#x3e;0) and the curvature radius at each of the end portions of the island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is r (r&#x3e;0), the relationship of t and r satisfies a conditional equation (t/2)&#x2266;r&#x2266;2t. Further, when the curvature radius of each of the end portions is r, a curvature center location <b>120</b> exists on a substrate side.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">Each of the insulating film <b>104</b> and the insulating film <b>105</b> can be formed using a material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, aluminum nitride, silicon oxide containing fluorine (SiOF), silicon oxide containing carbon (SiOC), diamond-like carbon (DLC), or porous silica.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">The conductive layer <b>106</b> that serves as a gate electrode is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> with the insulating film <b>104</b> and the insulating film <b>105</b> interposed therebetween. The conductive layer <b>106</b> can be formed using a metal element such as tantalum, tungsten, titanium, molybdenum, chromium, aluminum, copper, or niobium, or an alloy material or compound material containing the metal element. As the compound material, a nitrogen compound, an oxygen compound, a carbon compound, a halogen compound, or the like can be used; specifically, tungsten nitride, titanium nitride, aluminum nitride, or the like can be given. The conductive layer <b>106</b> is formed using one or a plurality of these materials to have a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure. Further, the conductive layer <b>106</b> may be formed using polycrystalline silicon to which an impurity element imparting one conductivity type such as phosphorus is added, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">The insulating film <b>107</b> and the insulating film <b>108</b> that serve as an interlayer insulating film are formed so as to cover the conductive layer <b>106</b>. In this embodiment mode, the interlayer insulating film is formed as a stacked-layer structure of the insulating film <b>107</b> and the insulating film <b>108</b>. Each of the insulating film <b>107</b> and the insulating film <b>108</b> can be formed using a silicon nitride film, a silicon nitride oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, a silicon oxide film, or another insulating film containing silicon. The interlayer insulating film may be formed as a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure including three layers or more.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">Further, contact holes (opening portions) <b>109</b><i>a </i>and <b>109</b><i>b </i>that reach the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> are formed in the insulating films <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>107</b>, and <b>108</b>. Also, the conductive layers <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>are formed so as to cover the contact holes <b>109</b><i>a </i>and <b>109</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Each of the conductive layers <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>serves as a source electrode or a drain electrode, and is electrically connected to a portion of the source region or drain region. Each of the conductive layers <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>is formed using a metal such as silver, gold, copper, nickel, platinum, lead, iridium, rhodium, tungsten, aluminum, tantalum, molybdenum, cadmium, zinc, iron, titanium, zirconium, or barium; Si or Ge; or an alloy or a nitride thereof.

<p id="p-0060" num="0061">A semiconductor device according to this embodiment mode can be even more miniaturized by forming a semiconductor layer to be a thin film of 50 mm or thinner. Further, by an end portion of the semiconductor layer having curvature, a defect stemming from the end portion of the semiconductor layer can be reduced Consequently, a semiconductor device with high reliability can be manufactured. In addition, semiconductor devices can be manufactured with good yield.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">Next, an example of a manufacturing method of the semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> is described in specific with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">First, the insulating films <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>that serve as a base insulating film are formed over the substrate <b>101</b>, and the island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is formed over the insulating films <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). As the substrate <b>101</b>, a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, a sapphire substrate, a ceramic substrate, a metal substrate with an insulating film formed on a surface, or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">Each of the insulating films <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>is formed by a CVD method, a sputtering method, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method, or the like, using a material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or silicon nitride oxide. The insulating films <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>serve as blocking layers that prevent contamination of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> that is caused by diffusion of an alkali metal or the like from the substrate <b>101</b>. Further, the insulating films <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>serves as films that smooth a surface of the substrate <b>101</b> when the surface has asperity. Note that the insulating films <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>do not have to be formed if impurity diffusion from the substrate <b>101</b> and asperity of a substrate surface are not a problem. Also, although the base insulating film has a stacked-layer structure of two layers in this embodiment mode, it may have a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure of three or more layers.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">For the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, an amorphous semiconductor manufactured by a vapor growth method or a sputtering method using a semiconductor material gas typified by silane or germane (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;amorphous silicon (AS)&#x201d;); a polycrystalline semiconductor made by crystallizing the amorphous semiconductor with light energy or heat energy; or a semi-amorphous (also called &#x201c;microcrystal,&#x201d; and also referred to as &#x201c;SAS&#x201d; below) semiconductor can be used. For example, the island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be formed by crystallizing a semiconductor layer formed over an entire surface of the substrate <b>101</b> by a vapor growth method or a sputtering method, and then etching the semiconductor layer as selected.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">As a material forming the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, it is preferable to use a material mainly containing silicon. Specifically, silicon, silicon-germanium, or the like can be used. Also, germanium may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">As a crystallization method of the semiconductor layer, a laser crystallization method, a heat crystallization method using rapid thermal annealing (RTA) or an annealing furnace; a crystallization method using a metal element that promotes crystallization; a method combining these methods; or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">In the case of using a laser crystallization method, a laser beam emitted from a continuous wave laser (hereinafter also referred to as a &#x201c;CW laser&#x201d;) or a pulsed wave laser (hereinafter also referred to as a &#x201c;pulsed laser&#x201d;) can be used. As a laser which can be used here, a gas laser such as an Ar laser, a Kr laser, an excimer laser, a copper vapor laser, or a gold vapor laser, or a solid-state laser such as a laser whose medium is single-crystal YAG, YVO<sub>4</sub>, or forsterite (Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), YAlO<sub>3</sub>, or GdVO<sub>4</sub>, to which one or more of Nd, Yb, Cr, Ti, Ho, Fr, Tm, and Ta has been added as a dopant, or polycrystalline (ceramic) YAG, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, YVO<sub>4</sub>, YAlO<sub>3</sub>, or GdVO<sub>4</sub>, to which one or more of Nd, Yb, Cr, Ti, Ho, Er, Tm, and Ta has been added as a dopant; a glass laser; an alexandrite laser; a ruby laser; or a Ti:sapphire laser; or the like can be given. In the case of using the solid-state laser, any of the fundamental wave to fourth harmonic thereof can be selected as appropriate for irradiation. For example, the second harmonic (532 nm) or the third harmonic (355 nm) of an Nd:YVO<sub>4 </sub>laser (the fundamental wave: 1064 nm) can be used. When an Nd:YVO<sub>4 </sub>laser is used as a CW laser, a laser power density of about 0.01 to 100 MW/cm<sup>2 </sup>preferably, 0.1 to 10 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>) is required, and irradiation is conducted with a scanning rate of about 10 to 2000 cm/sec. Note that the second harmonic (532 nm) is preferably used here; this is because the second harmonic is superior in energy efficiency to the harmonics higher than this.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">When laser crystallization is performed using a CW laser, a semiconductor layer continuously receives energy; therefore, once the semiconductor layer is melted, the melted state can be continuous. Therefore, it is possible to move a solid-liquid interface of the semiconductor layer by scanning with a CW laser beam and to form a crystal grain which is elongated in one direction along this scanning direction. A solid-state laser is preferably used because its output is so stable that a stable process can be expected compared to a gas laser or the like. By using not only a CW laser but also a pulsed laser with a repetition rate of greater than or equal to 10 MHz, the similar effect can be obtained. In the case of a pulsed laser with a high repetition rate, when the pulse interval of the laser is shorter than the period after the semiconductor layer is melted and before the melted semiconductor layer is solidified, the semiconductor layer can be maintained in a melted state at all times. Also, by movement of the solid-liquid interface, a semiconductor layer including a crystal grain which is elongated in one direction can be formed. Moreover, oscillation of a laser beam with TEM<sub>00 </sub>(single transverse mode) is preferable because the energy homogeneity of a linear beam spot on an irradiation surface can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">The semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be formed into an island-shape by the steps of covering the semiconductor layer formed over the entire surface of the substrate with a mask made of a resist as selected and etching the semiconductor layer not covered with the mask made of a resist. The semiconductor layer can be etched by a dry etching method or a wet etching method. In the case of dry etching, an etching gas with high etching selectivity respect to the base insulating film is used. That is, an etching gas with a low etching rate with respect to the insulating films <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>and a high etching rate with respect to the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> may be used. As an etching gas, for example, a chlorine-based gas such as C<sub>2</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, or SiCl<sub>4</sub>, a fluorine-based gas such as CF<sub>4</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, or SF<sub>6</sub>, or a bromine-based gas such as HBr gas can be used. Further, an inert gas such as He, Ar, Ne, Kr, or Xe may be added as appropriate. Furthermore, an O<sub>2 </sub>gas may be added to a fluorine-based gas as appropriate. After the semiconductor layer is processed into a desired shape, the mask is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">The island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>103</b> may be formed such that a cross section of the end portion has a tapered form that is nearly at a right angle, or a tapered form with a gentle incline. For example, the end portion may be tapered such that a taper angle is greater than or equal to 45&#xb0; and less than 95&#xb0;, preferably, greater than or equal to 60&#xb0; and less than 95&#xb0;, or may be tapered with a gentle incline such that a taper angle is less than 45&#xb0;. The shape of the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be selected as appropriate by changing the etching condition or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072">Note that for the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, an SOI substrate of which a single-crystal semiconductor layer is provided over an insulating surface may be used instead of performing a thin film process that uses various crystallization methods. In this case, the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be formed using the single crystal semiconductor layer provided over the insulating surface.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0073">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an insulating film <b>115</b> is formed on a surface of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> by performing an alteration treatment on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>. Here, the alteration treatment refers to an oxidation treatment, a nitridation treatment, an oxynitridation treatment, a surface modification treatment, or the like performed on a substrate, a semiconductor layer, an insulating film, and a conductive layer. A desired treatment may be performed in a region of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> where the insulating film <b>115</b> is to be formed. Specifically, a thermal oxidation treatment, a treatment with a solution that has strong oxidative power such as ozone water, a plasma treatment, or the like is performed on a surface of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, so that an oxide of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is formed on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>. This also applies to cases of forming a nitride, an oxynitride, and a nitride oxide of the above semiconductor layer <b>103</b>. By forming the insulating film <b>115</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be reduced in thickness. Note that by performing a plasma treatment on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, controlling a thickness of the insulating film <b>115</b> becomes easy.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0074">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the insulating film <b>115</b> is removed by etching. A method of removing the insulating film <b>115</b> may be dry etching or wet etching.

Further, an inert gas of He, Ar, Xe, or the like may be added as appropriate. Furthermore, O<sub>2 </sub>gas or H<sub>2 </sub>gas may be added to a fluorine-based gas. In this embodiment mode, a mixed gas of C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>and He is used for dry etching. The semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be reduced in thickness by performing an alteration treatment on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> to form an insulating film on the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> and then removing the insulating film <b>115</b>. After etching, the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is reduced in thickness, and an end portion of the semiconductor layer comes to have curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, an alteration treatment is further performed on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> from which the insulating film <b>115</b> is removed, to form the insulating film <b>104</b> on the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>. A method of performing the alteration treatment on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> to form the insulating film <b>104</b> is similar to the case of forming the insulating film <b>115</b>. By performing the alteration treatment on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> to form the insulating film <b>104</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be reduced in thickness even more, and the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can have even more curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">Note that when the thickness of the island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is t (t&#x3e;0) and the curvature radius of a cross-section of each of the end portions of the island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is r (r&#x3e;0), the relationship of t and r satisfies a conditional equation (t/2)&#x2266;r&#x2266;2t. Further, when the curvature radius of each of the end portions is r, a curvature center location <b>120</b> exists on a substrate side.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">A thickness of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> after being reduced in thickness is in the range of 0.5 nm to 200 nm inclusive, preferably 1 nm to 50 nm inclusive, and more preferably 1 nm to 10 nm inclusive.</p>

A thickness of the insulating film <b>105</b> is in the range of 1 nm to 50 nm inclusive, preferably 1 nm to 20 nm inclusive, and more preferably 1 nm to 10 nm inclusive.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">The insulating film <b>104</b> and the insulating film <b>105</b> formed in the above manner can be used as a gate insulating film.

In this embodiment mode, the gate insulating film is to have a stacked-layer structure of the insulating film <b>104</b> and the insulating film <b>105</b>. By performing the alteration treatment on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> and forming the insulating film <b>104</b> on the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, coverage of the insulating film <b>104</b> that serves as the gate insulating film can be good. Further, the semiconductor layer can be covered sufficiently even in a case where the insulating films (the base insulating film) at a lower end portion of the semiconductor layer or a periphery thereof is removed, due to an effect of a cleaning process using hydrofluoric acid or the like that accompanies etching for processing the semiconductor layer into an island shape and various processes. Consequently, a short circuit between the semiconductor layer and the gate insulating film, occurrence of a leak current, electrostatic breakdown, or the like that stems from a defect in coverage by the gate insulating film at the end portions of the semiconductor layer can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the conductive layer <b>106</b> that serves as a gate electrode is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> with the insulating film <b>104</b> and the insulating film <b>105</b> therebetween. The conductive layer <b>106</b> that serves as a gate electrode is formed by forming a conductive layer over an entire substrate by a CVD method or a sputtering method using a conductive material, and then processing into a desired shape by etching the conductive layer as selected. For the conductive material, a metal element such as tantalum, tungsten, titanium, molybdenum, chromium, aluminum, copper, or niobium; or an alloy or compound material containing the metal element can be used. In addition, a semiconductor material typified by polycrystalline silicon to which an impurity element imparting one conductivity type such as phosphorus is added, can be used. The conductive layer <b>106</b> is formed as a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure using these conductive materials. The conductive layer <b>106</b> that serves as a gate electrode is formed to have a film thickness in the range of 50 nm to 1000 nm inclusive, preferably 100 nm to 800 nm inclusive, and more preferably 200 nm to 500 nm inclusive.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">In this embodiment mode, as the conductive layer <b>106</b> that serves as a gate electrode, a stacked-layer structure including a tantalum nitride layer with a film thickness of 30 nm and a tungsten layer with a film thickness of 370 nm is formed. By using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching method and adjusting an etching condition as appropriate (such as an amount of electrical energy applied to a coil-shaped electrode layer, an amount of electrical energy applied to an electrode layer on a substrate side, or a temperature of an electrode on the substrate side), the conductive layer <b>106</b> can be etched such that a cross section thereof has a desired tapered form. In this embodiment mode, etching is performed on the tungsten layer using an etching gas including CF<sub>4</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub>, and ICP etching is performed on the tantalum nitride layer using an etching gas including SF<sub>6</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub>. The tantalum nitride layer and the tungsten layer of the conductive layer <b>106</b> may have widths that are roughly the same, or the conductive layer <b>106</b> may have a slanted side surface.

In addition, the channel-forming region <b>111</b> is formed in the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>. The impurity element imparting one conductivity type may be an impurity element imparting n-type conductivity (for example, phosphorus, arsenic, or the like) or an impurity element imparting p-type conductivity (for example, boron, aluminum, gallium, or the like). In this embodiment mode, phosphorus that is an impurity element imparting n-type conductivity is used as the impurity element imparting one conductivity type.

<p id="p-0083" num="0084">In addition, an impurity element imparting one conductivity type for controlling a threshold voltage of a transistor may be added to the channel-forming region <b>111</b>. By adding an impurity element with a predetermined concentration to the channel-forming region <b>111</b>, the threshold voltage of the transistor can be forced to shift to a desired threshold voltage. As the impurity element imparting one conductivity type, an element imparting p-type conductivity such as boron, aluminum, or gallium, or an element imparting n-type conductivity such as phosphorus or arsenic can be used.

Further, the insulating film <b>107</b> may be formed by forming an insulating film using a CVD) method, a sputtering method, an ALD method, or the like, and then performing a high-density plasma treatment on the insulating film in an oxygen atmosphere or a nitrogen atmosphere. Note that here, although a two-layer stacked-layer structure of the insulating film <b>107</b> and the insulating film <b>108</b> is formed over the gate electrode, the interlayer insulating film may have a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure of three layers or more.

The etching may be wet etching or dry etching, or both may be employed. An etchant for the wet etching may be a fluorine-based solution such as a mixed solution of ammonium hydrogenfluoride and ammonium fluoride.

Aluminum or aluminum silicon is most suited as a material for forming the conductive layers <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>because it has a low resistance value and is inexpensive.

<p id="p-0094" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, an alteration treatment is performed on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> to form the insulating film <b>115</b> on the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>.

<p id="p-0095" num="0096">The high-density plasma treatment apparatus used in this embodiment mode is described below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the high-density plasma treatment apparatus includes at least a first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b>, a second plasma treatment chamber <b>202</b>, a load lock chamber <b>203</b>, and a common chamber <b>204</b>. In the first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b>, oxidation by plasma treatment is performed, and in the second plasma treatment chamber <b>202</b>, nitridation by plasma treatment is performed. Each chamber in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is evacuated, and the oxidation by plasma treatment and the nitridation by plasma treatment can be performed successively without exposure to air. In additions to what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the high-density plasma treatment apparatus may also include at least one of a CVD chamber, a sputtering chamber, and a heat annealing chamber, which make it possible to successively perform film formation and a plasma treatment, and a plasma treatment and heat annealing, without exposure to air. Since a unit for generating a magnetic field such as a magnet or a coil is not provided in a periphery of the first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b> and the second plasma treatment chamber <b>202</b>, the apparatus can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097">In the common chamber <b>204</b>, a robot arm <b>205</b> is provided. In the load lock chamber <b>203</b>, a cassette <b>206</b> which stores a plurality of the substrates <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is provided. One of the substrates <b>101</b> stored in the cassette <b>206</b> can be carried by the robot arm <b>205</b> to the first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b> or the second plasma treatment chamber <b>202</b> through the common chamber <b>204</b>.

<p id="p-0097" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a structure that is common between the first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b> and the second plasma treatment chamber <b>202</b>. To each of the first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b> and the second plasma treatment chamber <b>202</b>, a vacuum pump (not shown in figure) with which pressure reduction to a certain pressure is possible is connected, and exhaust gas is discharged from an exhaust opening <b>210</b>. Further, a substrate holder <b>211</b> is provided for each of the first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b> and the second plasma treatment chamber <b>202</b>, and the substrate <b>101</b> on which oxidation by plasma treatment or nitridation by plasma treatment is performed is held by the substrate holder <b>211</b>. This substrate holder <b>211</b> is also called a stage, and it is provided with a heater so that the substrate <b>101</b> can be heated. A gas such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, a rare gas, or ammonia is introduced into the plasma treatment chamber from a gas introduction port as shown by arrows <b>212</b>. A microwave <b>213</b> for exciting plasma is introduced through a wave-guide tube <b>215</b> that is provided over an antenna <b>214</b>. The plasma is generated in a region <b>217</b> shown by diagonal lines immediately below a dielectric plate <b>216</b> when pressure within the plasma treatment chamber after introducing the above gas is 5 Pa to 500 Pa, and the plasma is supplied over the substrate <b>101</b> which is provided away from the region shown by the diagonal lines. A shower plate <b>218</b> provided with a plurality of holes may be provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The plasma that is obtained in this plasma treatment chamber has an electron temperature of 1.5 eV or lower and an electron density of 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or higher; in other words, the plasma has a low electron temperature and a high electron density, and a plasma potential is 0 V to 5 V inclusive. Plasma meters regarding electron temperature, electron density, and plasma potential can be measured using a known method, for example a probe measuring method such as a double probe method.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">In this embodiment mode, oxygen, hydrogen, and argon are introduced into the first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b> so that a flow ratio is O<sub>2</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>:Ar=1:1:100, and plasma is generated using a microwave with a frequency of 2.45 GHz. Although oxidation by plasma treatment is possible without necessarily introducing hydrogen, it is preferable that a ratio of a flow amount of hydrogen to a flow amount of oxygen (H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) is in the range of 0 to 1.5 inclusive. The flow amount of oxygen is set for example in the range of 0.1 sccm to 100 sccm inclusive, and the flow amount of argon is set for example in the range of 100 sccm to 5000 sccm inclusive. If hydrogen is introduced, the flow amount of hydrogen is set for example in the range of 0.1 sccm to 100 sccm inclusive. A different rare gas may be introduced instead of argon. Pressure within the first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b> is set at an appropriate value in the range of 5 Pa to 500 Pa inclusive. The substrate <b>101</b> is set on the substrate holder <b>211</b> in the first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b>, and a temperature of the heater provided to the substrate holder <b>211</b> is maintained at 400&#xb0; C. Then, oxidation by plasma treatment is performed on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> over the substrate <b>101</b>. In this embodiment mode, as apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a portion of the base insulating film that is not covered by the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is also oxidized by the plasma treatment. However, in a case where the base insulating film is made of an oxide, an oxide film is not formed on a surface of the base insulating film even when oxidation by plasma treatment is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0100">By the above oxidation by plasma treatment, the insulating film <b>115</b> made of an oxide film, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, is formed on the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> so as to have a thickness of 20 nm or less. In the insulating film <b>115</b>, argon that is introduced to the first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b> is included at a predetermined concentration, for example, 1&#xd7;10<sup>15 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>inclusive. In forming the insulating film <b>115</b>, the thickness of the insulating film formed at the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> does not become thinner than other portions. Further, at that end portion, the insulating film <b>115</b> does not crack either. In a case of using a plastic substrate with heat resistance instead of a glass substrate, the temperature of the heater provided to the substrate holder <b>211</b> is maintained at 250&#xb0; C., for example.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0101">Since the plasma over the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> has an electron temperature of 1.5 eV or lower and an electron density of 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or higher, and since a region where plasma is generated is away from the semiconductor layer, plasma damage to the insulating film due to the oxidation by plasma treatment is suppressed. By using a microwave of 2.45 GHz for generating plasma instead of that with a frequency of 13.56 MHz, low electron temperature and high electron density can be realized easily. Further, if low electron temperature and high electron density can be obtained, a method other than using the microwave of 2.45 GHz may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the insulating film <b>115</b> formed by the plasma treatment is removed. A method of removing the insulating film <b>115</b> can be dry etching or wet etching. For example, in a case of performing dry etching, a fluorocarbon-based gas such as CHF<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, or C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>; a chlorine-based gas such as Cl<sub>2</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, or SiCl<sub>4</sub>; a fluorine-based gas such as CF<sub>4</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, or SF<sub>6</sub>; or HBr gas can be used as an etching gas. Further, an inert gas of He, Ar, Xe, or the like may be added as appropriate. Furthermore, O<sub>2 </sub>gas may be added to a fluorine-based gas. By removing the insulating film <b>115</b> that is formed by performing plasma treatment on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be reduced in thickness. After etching, the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is reduced in thickness, and the end portion of the semiconductor layer has curvature. In this embodiment mode, ICP etching is performed using C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, and He.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0103">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, a plasma treatment is performed on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> to form an insulating film <b>116</b> on a surface of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>. A method of oxidation by plasma treatment performed on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is the same method used when forming the insulating film <b>115</b>. By forming the insulating film <b>116</b> by performing the plasma treatment on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be reduced in thickness even more. The insulating film <b>116</b> can be used as a gate insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0104">The insulating film <b>116</b> may be made into a silicon oxynitride film by performing nitridation by plasma treatment in the second plasma treatment chamber <b>202</b>, and the silicon oxynitride film may be used as a gate insulating film. When performing nitridation by plasma treatment, nitrogen and argon are used as gasses introduced to the second plasma treatment chamber <b>202</b>, and the temperature of the glass substrate is to be the same as that when the above-mentioned oxidation by plasma treatment is performed. Hydrogen may also be introduced in addition to nitrogen and argon, and argon may be replaced with another rare gas. Further, instead of nitrogen, a gas used when nitridation is performed by a heat treatment at high temperature, such as ammonia or N<sub>2</sub>O can be used. The insulating film <b>116</b> includes the rare gas introduced into the second plasma treatment chamber <b>202</b> at a predetermined concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0105">Nitridation by plasma treatment may be performed on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> in the second plasma treatment chamber <b>202</b> first to form a nitride film. Further, oxidation by plasma treatment may be performed on the nitride film in the first plasma treatment chamber <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0106">In an example of an insulating film that is formed by a high-density plasma treatment using the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, a silicon oxide layer with a thickness of 3 nm to 6 nm inclusive is formed on a surface of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> by a plasma treatment in an atmosphere containing oxygen, and then a surface of the silicon oxide layer is treated with nitrogen plasma in an atmosphere containing nitrogen to form a nitrogen-plasma treated layer Specifically, a silicon oxide layer with a thickness of 3 nm to 6 nm inclusive is first formed on the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> by a plasma treatment in an atmosphere containing oxygen. Then, a nitrogen-plasma treated layer with a high nitrogen concentration is provided on the surface of the silicon oxide layer or in a periphery of the surface, by performing a plasma treatment in an atmosphere containing nitrogen. Note that the periphery of the surface refers to the silicon oxide layer from the surface to a depth in the range of 0.5 nm to 1.5 nm inclusive. For example, by performing the plasma treatment in an atmosphere containing nitrogen, a structure becomes that in which nitrogen is contained at a ratio of 20 atomic % to 50 atomic % inclusive in a region of the silicon oxide layer from the surface to about 1 nm in depth perpendicular to the surface. Further, a surface of the insulating film can be oxidized or nitrided by a high-density plasma treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0107">For example, by forming a silicon layer as the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> and oxidizing a surface of the silicon layer by plasma treatment, a dense oxide film that does not warp at an interface with the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be formed. Further, by nitriding the oxide film by plasma treatment to form a nitride film by substituting oxygen in a surface layer portion with nitrogen, an insulating layer can be even denser. In this manner, an insulating film with high withstand voltage can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0108">In any case, by using a solid phase oxidation treatment or a solid phase nitridation treatment by plasma treatment as described above, even when a glass substrate with an allowable temperature limit of 700&#xb0; C. is used, an insulating film can be obtained that is equal to an insulating film that is formed by a thermal oxidation treatment with a temperature range of 950&#xb0; C. to 1050&#xb0; C. inclusive. In other words, as a semiconductor element, in particular as an insulating film that serves as a gate insulating film of a thin film transistor or a non-volatile storage element, an insulating film with high reliability can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0109">In this manner, by performing oxidation, nitridation and the like by plasma treatment on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, the insulating film <b>116</b> is formed. Since the thickness of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> becomes thin depending on the thickness of the insulating film that is formed, the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> can be reduced in thickness. Further, the insulating film <b>116</b> that is formed can be used as a gate insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, after the insulating film <b>116</b> is formed, a silicon nitride film or a silicon nitride film containing oxygen may be formed as an insulating film <b>117</b> by a CVD method or the like so that a gate insulating film is formed along with the insulating film <b>116</b>. Consequently, oxidation of a gate electrode and a wiring that extends from the gate electrode that are formed later, which occurs by coming into contact with the insulating film that is made of an oxide film, can be suppressed. Further, nitridation by plasma treatment at a low electron temperature and high electron density may be performed on the above silicon nitride film or the silicon nitride film containing oxygen, for a purpose of densification or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0111">Note that the insulating film <b>116</b> can be used as a gate insulating film as a single layer, or the insulating film <b>117</b> can be used as a gate insulating film as a single layer by forming the insulating film <b>117</b> after removing the insulating film <b>116</b>. In this embodiment mode, a stacked-layer structure of the insulating film <b>116</b> and the insulating film <b>117</b> is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0112">Next, a conductive layer used as a gate electrode is formed over the insulating film <b>116</b> and the insulating film <b>117</b>. The conductive layer is to have a thickness of 100 nm to 500 nm inclusive. The conductive layer can be formed by a sputtering method, an evaporation method, or a CVD method. The conductive layer may be formed of an element selected from tantalum, tungsten, titanium, molybdenum, aluminum, copper, chromium, and neodymium; or an alloy material or a compound material mainly containing the element. Alternatively, a semiconductor layer typified by a polycrystalline silicon film doped with an impurity element such as phosphorus, or an AgPdCu alloy layer may be used for the conductive layer. The conductive layer may have a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure with two or more layers. For example, in a case of forming a three-layer structure, a 50 nm thick tungsten film as a first conductive layer, a 500 nm thick aluminum-silicon (Al&#x2014;Si) alloy film as a second conductive film, and a 30 nm thick titanium nitride film as a third conductive layer may be stacked in this order. Alternatively, a tungsten nitride film may be used instead of the tungsten film in the first conductive layer, an aluminum-titanium (Al&#x2014;Ti) alloy film may be used instead of the aluminum-silicon (Al&#x2014;Si) alloy film in the second conductive layer, and a titanium film may be used instead of titanium nitride film in the third conductive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0113">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a mask made of a resist is formed, the conductive layer is processed into a desired shape, and the conductive layer <b>106</b> that serves as a gate electrode layer is formed. Note that as an etching gas, a chlorine-based gas typified by Cl<sub>2</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, or CCl<sub>4</sub>; a fluorine-based gas typified by CF<sub>4</sub>, SF<sub>6</sub>, or NF<sub>3</sub>; or O<sub>2 </sub>can be used as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0114">Although in this embodiment mode, an example is shown in which a gate electrode is formed to have a side surface that is perpendicular to a substrate, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, both the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer may have a tapered shape when seen from a cross section, or one of the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer may have a surface that is perpendicular to the substrate by anisotropic etching. A taper angle may be different or the same between the conductive layers that are stacked. By having a tapered shape, coverage by a film that is stacked thereover improves, and reliability improves because defects are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0115">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, an impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added using the conductive layer as a mask, to form the impurity regions <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>having one conductivity type each serving as a source region or drain region. Also, the channel-forming region <b>111</b> is formed in the semiconductor layer. Specifically, the formation method of the impurity regions shown in the embodiment mode <b>1</b> can be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0116">Next, an interlayer insulating film is formed so as to cover the insulating films and conductive layer provided over the substrate <b>101</b>. In this embodiment mode, the interlayer insulating film is a stacked-layer structure of the insulating film <b>107</b> and the insulating film <b>108</b>. Specifically, the formation method of the interlayer insulating film shown in the embodiment mode <b>1</b> can be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0117">Next, contact holes (opening portions) that reach the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> are formed in the insulating film <b>107</b>, the insulating film <b>108</b>, the insulating film <b>116</b>, and the insulating film <b>117</b>, using a mask made of a resist. Specifically, the formation method of the contact holes shown in the embodiment mode <b>1</b> can be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0118">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, a conductive layer is formed so as to cover the contact holes, and the conductive layer is etched to form the conductive layers <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>each functioning as a source electrode or a drain electrode that is electrically connected with a portion of the source region or the drain region. Specifically, the formation method of the conductive layers <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>shown in the embodiment mode <b>1</b> can be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0119">Accordingly, a thin film transistor to which the present invention is applied can be formed. Note that the structure of the transistor shown in this embodiment mode is one example, and the structure is not limited to that shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0120">A characteristic of this embodiment mode, as described above, is to perform a plasma treatment with plasma of a low electron temperature and high electron density on a semiconductor layer in order to form a gate insulating film of a thin film transistor. The gate insulating film according to this embodiment mode is one for which plasma damage and crack occurrence are suppressed, and it can be formed at a temperature that does not affect the glass substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0121">In a semiconductor device according to this embodiment mode, a semiconductor layer is reduced in thickness, and a channel-forming region is formed in a region where the thickness is reduced. Consequently, since it is possible to reduce a sub-threshold value and reduce a threshold voltage of a transistor, an operation characteristic of the semiconductor device can be improved. Further, by making an end portion of the semiconductor layer have curvature along with a thinning processes of the semiconductor layer, coverage by an insulating film formed over the semiconductor layer can be improved. Accordingly, since a defect stemming from the end portion of the semiconductor layer can be reduced, a semiconductor device with high reliability can be manufactured. Therefore, a semiconductor device with enhanced performance is possible.</p>

A desired treatment may be performed in a region of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> where the insulating film <b>115</b> is to be formed. Specifically, a thermal oxidation treatment, a treatment with a solution that has strong oxidative power such as ozone water, a plasma treatment, or the like is performed on a surface of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, so that an oxide of the semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is formed on the semiconductor layer <b>103</b>. This also applies to cases of forming a nitride, an oxynitride, and a nitride oxide of the above semiconductor layer <b>103</b>.

<p id="p-0125" num="0126">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the insulating film <b>115</b> is removed by etching.

<p id="p-0150" num="0151">One example of a top structure of a semiconductor device described in this embodiment mode is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. A semiconductor device <b>2180</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> includes a thin film integrated circuit <b>2131</b> including a plurality of elements such as thin film transistors for forming a memory portion and a logic portion, and a conductive layer <b>2132</b> which serves as an antenna.

The semiconductor device according to the present invention described in any of the embodiment modes <b>1</b> to <b>4</b> can be applied to the thin film integrated circuit <b>2131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0152">Schematic cross-sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11B and 11C</figref>. The conductive layer <b>2132</b> which serves as an antenna is provided above the elements for forming the memory portion and the logic portion. For example, the conductive layer <b>2132</b> which serves as an antenna can be provided above the thin film integrated circuit <b>2131</b> with an insulating film <b>2130</b> interposed therebetween (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>). Alternatively, the conductive layer <b>2132</b> which serves as an antenna may be provided over a substrate <b>2133</b> and then the substrate <b>2133</b> and the thin film integrated circuit <b>2131</b> may be attached to each other so as to sandwich the conductive layer <b>2132</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>). The example in which a conductive layer <b>2136</b> provided over the insulating film <b>2130</b> and the conductive layer <b>2132</b> which serves as an antenna are electrically connected to each other with conductive particles <b>2134</b> contained in an adhesive resin <b>2135</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0153">Note that in this embodiment mode, although the example in which the conductive layer <b>2132</b> which serves as an antenna is provided in the shape of a coil and either an electromagnetic induction method or an electromagnetic coupling method is employed is described, the semiconductor device of the present invention is not limited thereto, and a microwave method may be employed as well. In the case of a microwave method, the shape of the conductive layer <b>2132</b> which serves as an antenna may be decided as appropriate depending on the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0154">For example, when the microwave method (e.g., with an UHF band (in the range of 860 to 960 MHz inclusive), a frequency band of 2.45 GHz, or the like) is employed as the signal transmission method of the semiconductor device <b>2180</b>, the shape such as the length of the conductive layer <b>2132</b> which serves as an antenna may be set as appropriate in consideration of the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave used in sending a signal. For example, the conductive layer <b>2132</b> which serves as an antenna can be formed into a shape of a line (e.g., a dipole antenna (see FIG. <b>12</b>A)), into a flat shape (e.g., a patch antenna (see FIG. <b>12</b>B)), into a shape of a ribbon (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12C and 12D</figref>), or the like.

<p id="p-0154" num="0155">The conductive layer <b>2132</b> which serves as an antenna is formed of a conductive material by a CVD method, a sputtering method, a printing method such as a screen printing method or a gravure printing method, a droplet discharging method, a dispenser method, a plating method, or the like. As the conductive material, a metal element such as aluminum, titanium, silver, copper, gold, platinum, nickel, palladium, tantalum, molybdenum, or the like, or an alloy material or a compound material mainly containing the element is used, and the conductive layer <b>2132</b> employs a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0156">For example, when the conductive layer <b>2132</b> which serves as an antenna is formed by a screen printing method, it can be provided by selectively printing a conductive paste in which conductive particles with a grain diameter of several nm to several tens of &#x3bc;m are dissolved or dispersed in an organic resin. As the conductive particle, at least one of metal particles such as silver, gold, copper, nickel, platinum, palladium, tantalum, molybdenum, titanium, and the like; fine particles of silver halide; or dispersive nanoparticles can be used. Further, as the organic resin included in the conductive paste, at least one of organic resins which function as a binder, a solvent, a dispersing agent, and a coating material of metal particles can be used. Typically, an organic resin such as an epoxy resin and a silicon resin can be given as an example. Further, in forming the conductive layer <b>2132</b>, it is preferable to bake the conductive paste after providing it. For example, in the case of using fine particles (e.g., with a grain diameter of 1 to 100 nm, inclusive) mainly containing silver as a material of the conductive paste, the conductive layer <b>2132</b> can be formed by baking the conductive paste at a temperature in the range of 150 to 300&#xb0; C. inclusive to harden it. Alternatively, fine particles mainly containing solder or lead-free solder may be used. In this case, fine particles with a grain diameter of less than or equal to 20 &#x3bc;m are preferably used. Solder and lead-free solder have the advantage of low cost.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Korean patent application number 10-2009-0049351 filed on Jun. 4, 2009, and to the divisional application of Ser. No. 12/493,268 filed on Jun. 29, 2009 which is now U.S. Pat. No. 8,004,048 which are all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the same, and more particularly, to a semiconductor device which can realize a reduction in gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) and a method for manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the design rule for achieving more highly integrated semiconductor devices continues to demand decreases the critical dimensions, a problem can arise with regards to unwanted short channel effects across these resultant diminished channel lengths of the highly integrated transistors. Doping concentrations of a source region and a drain region may also need to be increased to enhance the electric fields which can also cause unwanted increases in junction leakage current. Due to these constraints, it is becoming more and more difficult to achieve an appropriate threshold voltage needed in these highly integrated transistor semiconductor devices that are configured to have a planar channel structure. Therefore, limitations necessarily exist in improving refresh characteristics of these highly integrated planar transistor semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to address these problems, a recess gate in which a channel length is effectively increased which results in realizing a suppression of the short channel effect has been proposed and studied in the art. However, since the recess gate is formed so that a gate electrode projects outwardly from a semiconductor substrate, it then becomes more difficult to conduct subsequent processes such as conducting contact plug forming processes and planarization processes without compromising the integrity of the outwardly projecting recess gate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Under these circumstances, a buried gate in which a gate electrode is formed within the interior of semiconductor substrate has been proposed. In the buried gate configuration, the gate electrode is formed in the semiconductor substrate, and as a result subsequent processes such as contact plug forming processes and planarization processes can be more easily performed without compromising the structural integrity of the buried gate. Furthermore, since the buried gate electrode does not contact a bit line, then advantages can be realized such as decreasing the parasitic capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When forming the buried gate, a metallic material is mainly used as a gate electrode material. In this regard, since the metallic material has a work function relatively higher than a polysilicon layer, then the gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) current is prone to increasing. The GIDL current further increases where the gate electrode adjoins a source region and a drain region. Due to this fact, in the conventional art, as leakage current increases, a data retention time decreases, whereby the characteristics and the reliability of a semiconductor device are likely to be compromised.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereafter, specific embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. It is understood herein that the drawings are not necessarily to scale and in some instances proportions may have been exaggerated in order to more clearly depict certain features of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view illustrating a semiconductor device in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. A groove H is defined in a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, and a buried gate <b>116</b> is formed in the lower portion of the groove H such that the lower portion of the buried gate <b>116</b> is wider than the upper portion of the buried gate <b>116</b>. The buried gate <b>116</b> preferably comprises a metal-based layer, for example, the buried gate <b>116</b> may include a titanium nitride layer <b>112</b> formed on the surfaces of the lower portion of the groove H. A barrier layer <b>110</b> and a tungsten layer <b>114</b> may be formed on the titanium nitride layer <b>112</b> to fill in the lower portion of the groove H. The barrier layer <b>110</b> is formed along the sidewalls of the upper portion of the buried gate <b>116</b> and along the sidewalls of the upper portion of the groove H. The barrier layer <b>110</b> preferably comprises, for example, a nitride layer at a thickness of preferably about 50&#x2dc;500 &#x212b;. A capping layer <b>118</b> comprising an oxide layer is formed on the buried gate <b>116</b> so that it completely fills in the groove H. Source and drain regions <b>120</b> are formed in portions of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> along both opposing sides of the buried gate <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the first embodiment of the present invention, due to the fact that the buried gate <b>116</b> fills in the lower portion of the groove H defined in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> so that a gate electrode does not project out of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, it is possible to protect against the occurrence of a bridging phenomenon while conducting a contact plug forming process and a planarization process. As a consequence of utilizing the present invention, since the occurrence of unwanted bridging contacts between the buried gate <b>116</b> and a bit line is protected against then parasitic capacitances can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Also, in the present invention, because leakage current between the buried gate <b>116</b> and the source and drain regions <b>120</b> can be reduced by the barrier layer <b>110</b> which is formed on the sidewalls of the upper portion of the buried gate <b>116</b>, then GIDL (gate-induced drain leakage) can also be reduced. Accordingly, data retention times can be increased, as well as, enhancing characteristics and the reliability of a resultant semiconductor device made from the present invention can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition, in the first embodiment of the present invention, since the barrier layer <b>110</b> is formed only on the sidewalls of the upper portion of the groove H, then the upper portion of the buried gate <b>116</b>, which has a width smaller than the lower portion of the buried gate <b>116</b>, is formed to project upward. By doing this in the present invention, the sheet resistance of the buried gate <b>116</b> can be reduced, whereby further improvement in the characteristics and the reliability of the semiconductor device made from the present invention can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2H</figref> are sectional views illustrating the processes of a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, after sequentially forming a pad oxide layer <b>102</b> and a pad nitride layer <b>104</b> on a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, by subsequently patterning the pad nitride layer <b>104</b> and the pad oxide layer <b>102</b>, a gate forming region of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is exposed. Then, by etching the exposed region of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, a groove H for a gate is defined within the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, after forming a sacrificial layer <b>106</b> to fill the groove H, the surface of the sacrificial layer <b>106</b> is subsequently planarized. The sacrificial layer <b>106</b> is preferably formed as a layer which is more easily etched than the barrier. That is, the sacrificial layer <b>106</b> has an etching selectivity with respect to a material layer for the barrier. Accordingly, the sacrificial layer <b>106</b> may comprise, for example, an oxide layer or a photoresist film. After planarizing the sacrificial layer <b>106</b>, the sacrificial layer <b>106</b> is then etched back so that the sacrificial layer <b>106</b> remains only in the lower portion of the groove H. It is preferred that the sacrificial layer <b>106</b> be etched so that the remaining portion of the sacrificial layer <b>106</b> remains below the lower ends of where the source and drain regions will be subsequently formed. Accordingly, it is preferred that the remaining portion of the sacrificial layer <b>106</b> after the etching is at a depth of about 100&#x2dc;1,000 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a material layer <b>108</b> for a barrier is formed on the sacrificial layer <b>106</b>, on the sidewalls of the groove H and on the pad nitride layer <b>104</b>. The particular compositional makeup of the material layer <b>108</b> for a barrier is preferably composed of a substance that etches more easily than the sacrificial layer <b>106</b>. That is the material layer <b>108</b> for the barrier is formed as a layer which has an etching selectivity with respect to the sacrificial layer <b>106</b>, for example, as a nitride layer, preferably, to a thickness of about 50&#x2dc;500 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the material layer <b>108</b> for a barrier is etched so that the material layer <b>108</b> for a barrier remains substantially only on the sidewalls of the upper portion of the groove H. The etching of the material layer <b>108</b> for a barrier is performed by using an etch-back process. As a result of the etching, a barrier layer <b>110</b> is formed on the sidewalls of the upper portion of the groove H.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, the sacrificial layer <b>106</b> is subsequently removed by preferably using a dip-out process. The dip-out process is conducted in such a way as to selectively remove the sacrificial layer <b>106</b>, and therefore, the barrier layer <b>110</b> that is formed on the sidewalls of the upper portion of the groove H is not substantially removed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, after all of the sacrificial layer <b>106</b> has been removed, a gate insulation layer (not shown) is formed on the surface of the lower portion of the groove H and on the surface of the barrier layer <b>110</b>. Afterwards a titanium nitride layer <b>112</b> is formed on the gate insulation layer. Thereupon, a tungsten layer <b>114</b> is formed on the titanium nitride layer <b>112</b> to fill in the groove H. Then, the tungsten layer <b>114</b>, the titanium nitride layer <b>112</b> and the gate insulation layer are all etched back so that the tungsten layer <b>114</b>, the titanium nitride layer <b>112</b> and the gate insulation layer remain only in the lower portion of the groove H.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As a result, a buried gate <b>116</b> is formed so that the buried gate <b>116</b> is filled in the lower portion of the groove H and contacts the barrier layer <b>110</b> at the upper portion thereof. The buried gate <b>116</b> is formed in so that the upper portion of the buried gate <b>116</b> has a smaller width, by the thickness of the barrier layer <b>110</b> formed on the sidewalls of the upper portion of the groove H, than the lower portion of the buried gate <b>116</b>. As a consequence, the upper portion of the buried gate <b>116</b> has a projecting shape.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, a capping layer <b>118</b> is formed on the buried gate <b>116</b> to completely fill in the groove H. The capping layer <b>118</b> is formed, for example, as an oxide layer. Next, the capping layer <b>118</b>, the barrier layer <b>110</b>, the pad nitride layer <b>104</b> and the pad oxide layer <b>102</b> are removed in a manner so as to expose the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, by conducting an ion-implantation process for the exposed semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, source and drain regions <b>120</b> are formed in portions of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> on both sides of the buried gate <b>116</b>. Preferably, the source and drain regions <b>120</b> are formed in such a way as to be connected with the channel of the buried gate <b>116</b> and have a depth that minimizes an overlap with the buried gate <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thereafter, while not shown in a drawing, by sequentially conducting a series of well-known subsequent processes, the manufacture of a semiconductor device according to the second embodiment of the present invention is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As is apparent from the above description, in the second embodiment of the present invention, due to the fact that a buried gate is formed to be filled in the lower portion of a groove defined in a semiconductor substrate, it is possible to protect against a gate electrode from being exposed out of the semiconductor substrate. Hence, in the present invention, it is possible to protect against the occurrence of a bridging phenomenon while subsequently conducting a contact plug forming process and a planarization process. Further, since contact between the buried gate and a bit line is protected against and thus parasitic capacitance can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Also, in the second embodiment of the present invention, due to the fact that a barrier layer is formed along the sidewalls of the upper portion of the buried gate, unwanted leakage current between the buried gate and the source and drain regions can be minimized by the presence of the barrier layer, whereby GIDL can be reduced. Accordingly, in the present invention, as the data retention time is increased, the characteristics and the reliability of a semiconductor device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, in the second embodiment of the present invention, since the barrier layer is formed only on the sidewalls of the upper portion of the groove, the upper portion of the buried gate can be formed to have a projecting shape. By doing this, the sheet resistance of the buried gate of the in the present invention can be reduced and thereby the characteristics and the reliability of the resultant semiconductor device can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While it was described in the above embodiments of the present invention that GIDL is reduced by forming the barrier layer comprising a nitride layer on the sidewalls of the upper portion of the buried gate, it is conceivable in another embodiment of the present invention that GIDL can be effectively reduced by forming an oxide layer instead of forming a nitride layer on the sidewalls of the upper portion of the buried gate.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3D</figref> are sectional views illustrating the processes of a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, similarly to the above-described second embodiment of the present invention, after defining a groove H by etching a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, a barrier layer <b>110</b> is formed on the sidewalls of the upper portion of the groove H. Then, a buried gate <b>116</b> is formed to fill the lower portion of the groove H. The buried gate <b>116</b> includes a gate insulation layer (not shown), a titanium nitride layer <b>112</b> and a tungsten layer <b>114</b> and the upper portion of the buried gate <b>116</b> is wider than the lower portion of the buried gate <b>116</b>. Also shown are a pad oxide layer <b>102</b> and a pad nitride layer <b>104</b> on a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the barrier layer <b>110</b> is removed from the resultant semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> which is formed with the buried gate <b>116</b>. At this time, when removing the barrier layer <b>110</b>, a partial thickness of the exposed pad nitride layer <b>114</b> may also be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, a capping layer <b>118</b> is formed on the buried gate <b>116</b> so as to fill in the groove H removed with the barrier layer <b>110</b>. The capping layer <b>118</b> is formed, for example, as an oxide layer. Next, the capping layer <b>118</b>, the pad nitride layer <b>104</b> and the pad oxide layer <b>102</b> are removed so that the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is exposed.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view illustrating a semiconductor device in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention. A first groove H<b>1</b> and a second groove H<b>2</b> which communicates with the lower end of the first groove H<b>1</b> are defined in a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. The second groove H<b>2</b> is placed at the center portion of the lower end of the first groove H<b>1</b> and has a width narrower than the first groove H<b>1</b>. A buried gate <b>116</b>, which has the same width on the upper and lower portions thereof, is formed in the second groove H<b>2</b> and the lower portion of the first groove H<b>1</b>. The buried gate <b>116</b> comprises a metal-based layer, and for example, includes a titanium nitride layer <b>112</b> which is formed on the surface of the second groove H<b>2</b> and the surface of a barrier layer <b>110</b> and a tungsten layer <b>114</b> which is formed on the titanium nitride layer <b>112</b> to fill the second groove H<b>2</b> and the lower portion of the first groove H<b>1</b>.

As a consequence, in the present invention, since contact between the buried gate <b>116</b> and a bit line is protected against, then parasitic capacitances can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Also, in the present invention, because leakage current between the buried gate <b>116</b> and the source and drain regions <b>120</b> can be minimized by the presence of the barrier layer <b>110</b> which is formed on the sidewalls of the upper portion of the buried gate <b>116</b> and the sidewalls of the first groove H<b>1</b>, GIDL (gate-induced drain leakage) can be reduced.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a National Stage application of PCT/SG2007/000247, filed Aug. 10, 2007, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to interconnects for, and a method for interconnecting, one or more of: atomic scale circuits, molecular devices and uni-molecular circuits; and relates more particularly, though not exclusively, to such interconnects and method where interconnects are fabricated while being supported by a substrate for the circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Interconnects of atomic and/or molecular devices, and of uni-molecular circuits, require a fully planar and ultra clean technology with a precision that is at the atomic scale. This has not been able to be solved by the use of known nanolithography techniques. Nano-imprint and E-Beam Nanolithography use organics which pollute the supporting surface of the atomic and/or molecular devices, or intra-molecular circuits. Furthermore, they do not reach a precision that is at the atomic scale. Nanostencil (dynamic and static) avoids the pollution problem but is not atomic in its scale. Furthermore, none of these can provide an atomically flat supporting surface after the process. Finally, the usual surface cleaning procedures normally destroy the result obtained by nanolithography.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an exemplary aspect there is provided a method for forming interconnects in a substrate, the substrate comprising a semiconductor layer on an oxide layer forming a silicon-on-oxide substrate, the method comprising forming a plurality of holes into the substrate to the semiconductor layer, and metalizing the plurality of holes to form the interconnects.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to another exemplary aspect there is provided interconnects for atomic, molecular and uni-molecular circuits on a substrate, the substrate comprising a semiconductor layer on an oxide layer forming a silicon-on-oxide substrate, the interconnects comprising a plurality of metalized holes formed in the substrate from a side thereof to doped portions of the semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a further exemplary aspect there is provided a method for doping a semiconductor layer in a substrate, the substrate comprising a semiconductor layer on an oxide layer forming a silicon-on-oxide substrate, the method comprising forming a plurality of holes into the substrate to the semiconductor layer and doping portions of the semiconductor layer through the plurality of holes. The method may further comprise subsequently metalizing the plurality of holes to form interconnects.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For all aspects, the holes may be formed from a second side of the substrate. Prior to metallization, portions of the semiconductor layer may be doped through the plurality of holes. Prior to forming the plurality of holes, the semiconductor layer may have formed thereon a layer of a thermal oxide and a layer of a dielectric. Prior to forming the plurality of holes, but after forming the dielectric layer, a plurality of buried metal electrodes may be formed in the dielectric layer. Each buried metal electrode may have an inner end. The inner ends may face each other and there may be a gap between them. The dielectric may remain between the plurality of buried metal electrodes, and between the inner ends. Nano-electrodes may be formed on the inner ends and may extend towards each other with a nano-gap therebetween. The plurality of holes may be formed through the nano-electrodes, the dielectric layer and the thermal oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Doping may be by use of a focused ion beam. A window may be opened from a first side of the substrate and may extend to the oxide layer. The first side may be opposite the second side. The window may be formed prior to the buried metal electrodes being formed. A portion of the oxide layer adjacent the doped portions of the semiconductor layer may be removed through the window and may expose a surface of the semiconductor layer. A circuit may be formed on the exposed surface of the semiconductor layer adjacent the doped portions. The circuit may be selected from: atomic scale, molecular scale and nano-scale. The window may be at least partially filled by wafer bonding to package the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The plurality of holes may be formed through the window from an exposed surface of the oxide layer. A plurality of upper electrodes may be formed on the window surfaces from the first side. The holes may be formed through the plurality of upper electrodes. A circuit may be formed on an exposed surface of the semiconductor layer adjacent the doped portions. The circuit may be selected from: atomic scale, molecular scale and nano-scale.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A second layer of dielectric may be formed over the plurality of buried metal electrodes. The second layer of dielectric may be removed from outer ends of the plurality of buried metal electrodes to provide probe landings.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The holes may be of a diameter in the range 10 to 100 nm or 30 to 50 nm. The interconnects may be mechanically supported by the substrate; and the use of detrimental chemicals is avoided. The atomic scale cleanliness of the exposed surface of the semiconductor layer may be maintained.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, at the commencement of the process there is substrate <b>10</b> having a first side <b>12</b> and a second side <b>14</b>. The substrate <b>10</b> may be any suitable inorganic semiconductor substrate such as, for example, silicon and may be of any suitable thickness. On the second side <b>14</b> the substrate <b>10</b> there is an undoped semi-conductor or a semi-conductor material <b>16</b> on the surface of an oxide <b>18</b> such that the substrate <b>10</b> is a silicon-on-insulator (&#x201c;SOP&#x201d;) substrate. The material <b>16</b> preferably is a large band gap material and may act to mechanically stabilize the position of interconnects to be fabricated, as will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">On both sides <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> of the SOI substrate <b>10</b> is grown at least one dielectric layer such as, for example, a layer <b>22</b> of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, SiO<sub>2 </sub>or any other compatible oxide or dielectric material, preferably grown by low pressure chemical vapour deposition (&#x201c;LPCVD&#x201d;) over a thin layer <b>20</b> of a thermal oxide such as, for example, SiO<sub>2</sub>. The SOI substrate may be fabricated by Smart-Cut or any other technique. In this method the thin silicon layer <b>20</b> of SiO<sub>2 </sub>is isolated from bulk of the silicon substrate <b>10</b> by the buried oxide layer <b>18</b>, and is sandwiched between the dielectric layers <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> a window <b>24</b> is opened in the dielectric layers <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> from the first side <b>12</b> by selective etching to enable further fabrication. Etching is preferably by using potassium hydroxide (KOH) and more preferably normally stops at the buried oxide layer <b>18</b> resulting in a thin SOI membrane <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, by using nano-stencil or equivalent lithography, buried metal micro-electrodes <b>28</b> are fabricated with the ends <b>30</b> of the electrodes <b>28</b> facing one another on the SOI membrane <b>26</b>, with the gap <b>36</b> between the ends <b>30</b> being a few microns. The dielectric layer <b>22</b> remains between the electrodes <b>28</b>, and between the ends <b>30</b> of the electrodes <b>28</b>. There may be any suitable number of electrodes <b>28</b> (four as shown) and they are preferably equally spaced. More preferably, they are arranged with their longitudinal axes substantially perpendicular (although they do not intersect). The electrodes <b>28</b> preferably extend from the outer edges <b>32</b> of the thin SOI membrane <b>26</b> towards its centre. The thin SOI membrane <b>26</b> may be of any suitable shape such as, for example, square as shown. In that case the electrodes may extend from the centres of each edge <b>32</b> of the thin SOI membrane <b>26</b>. The fabrication of the micro-electrodes <b>28</b> is such that the electrodes <b>28</b> are buried within and/or into the dielectric layer <b>22</b> of the second side <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, by using nano-patterning methods such as, for example nano-stencil, focused ion beam)(&#x201c;FIB&#x201d;) or masking, buried nano-electrodes <b>34</b> are fabricated that extend axially beyond the ends <b>30</b> of micro-electrodes <b>28</b> towards each other but not intersecting or contacting each other to thus leave a nanometer scale gap <b>35</b> between the ends <b>30</b>. As such the nano-electrodes <b>34</b> are somewhat cruciform or star shaped but without actually intersecting or contacting each other. Other shapes are possible depending on final geometry designed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is shown the next step in the method. Here, by using the FIB technique or etching, holes <b>36</b> are formed completely through the nano-electrodes <b>34</b> adjacent the innermost end of the electrodes <b>34</b>. As shown there are four holes <b>36</b> equally spaced around gap <b>35</b>. Each hole <b>36</b> has a diameter that is preferably in the range 10 to 100 nm, more preferably 30 to 50 nm. Each hole <b>36</b> passes from the nano-electrode <b>34</b> and into but not through the thin semiconductor layer <b>16</b> to expose a small portion <b>38</b> of the semiconductor layer <b>16</b> to the second side <b>14</b>, each small portion <b>38</b> being accessible from the second side <b>14</b> through the holes <b>36</b>. The holes <b>36</b> may be somewhat conical as shown, substantially cylindrical, or any other suitable, desired or required shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that the small portion <b>38</b> of the SOI layer <b>16</b> is doped from the second side <b>14</b> thorough the holes <b>36</b> again using FIB, direct ion implantation, or a similar technique, to form a doped portion <b>40</b> for each electrode <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and after the formation of the doped portion <b>40</b>, each hole <b>36</b> is metalized or filled with a conductive metal <b>42</b> such as, for example, platinum (Pt) down to the doped portions <b>40</b>. This may be by using FIB with an organo-metallic gas, or an equivalent technique. The metallization <b>42</b> provides interconnects that have a small electrical resistance and that extend from the SOI layer <b>16</b> to the second side <b>14</b>. The conductive metal <b>42</b> is supported by the material of the membrane <b>26</b>. The conductive metal <b>42</b> may substantially fully fill the holes <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows that by using physical vapor deposition or an equivalent technique, a thin layer <b>44</b> of a compatible dielectric film such as, for example, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>is deposited onto planar second side surface <b>14</b>. The layer <b>44</b> is to protect the second side <b>14</b> as well as the micro and nano-electrode wiring during next step of removal of the buried oxide layer <b>18</b> to expose the surface of the thin SOI layer <b>16</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, where the buried oxide layer <b>18</b> is removed from the first side <b>12</b> through the window <b>24</b> for the full width and depth of the window <b>24</b>. Removal may be by wet chemical etching, or its equivalent, in order to expose the portion <b>46</b> of the surface of the thin SOI layer <b>16</b> of the full width and depth of the window <b>24</b>. Wet chemical etching may be by, for example, using a buffered hydrofluoric acid. The portion <b>46</b> is to be thermally reconstructed to provide an automatically flat and clean surface.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, large contact pads <b>48</b> are formed at the outer ends <b>50</b> of each micro-electrode <b>28</b> by dry etching, or an equivalent technique, on the dielectric film <b>44</b> to provide probe landings. The exposed portion <b>46</b> of the surface of the SOI layer <b>16</b> is cleaned to provide an atomically flat semiconductor surface which can be imaged by an ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (&#x201c;UHV-STM&#x201d;). An atomic/molecular/nano-scale circuit <b>50</b> is then formed on the doped portions by, for example, STM fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this way the metal interconnects <b>42</b> are at all times physically supported by the membrane <b>26</b>, allowing the interconnects <b>42</b> to be at the nano scale. Preferably, the interconnects are the same size as the holes <b>36</b>. The interconnects may be of a diameter in the range 10 to 100 nm, preferably 30 to 50 nm. The interconnects <b>42</b> may be somewhat conical as shown, substantially cylindrical, or any other suitable, desired or required shape. A larger area of surface may be conductive by ion implantation through a mask, instead of using FIB over nanoscale areas. The surface patterning process is chemical free. As such there is no coating of the surface with photoresists such as optically active or electron bombardment active chemicals. There is also the ability to pattern from the first and/or second side and have the opposite working side with an atomically clean and flat surface.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this regard, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the interconnects <b>42</b> may be formed through the window <b>24</b>, with electrodes <b>52</b> being formed on the front surface within and through the window <b>24</b>. The electrodes <b>52</b> are formed before hole formation to operatively connect with the interconnects <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Also, by interconnecting the atomic and/or molecular devices <b>50</b> and circuits from the second side <b>14</b> of the supporting wafer <b>10</b>, and by stopping the interconnects <b>42</b> before reaching the first surface <b>12</b>, the first surface <b>12</b> is not transformed and remains as prepared or can be re-prepared. There is no need to perform nanolithography on the top active surface <b>46</b> where the atomic and/or molecular circuits <b>50</b> will be fabricated. The top surface <b>46</b> remains atomically flat. Local doping performed from the second side <b>14</b> completes the interconnect <b>42</b> without disturbing the preserved flatness of the top active surface <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">By embedding the metallic interconnects <b>42</b> at the second surface <b>14</b>, the interconnects <b>42</b> are rigidified as they form part of the atomic and molecular scale circuit support. This avoids the use of multiple metallic tips addressing devices vertically from the top. The window <b>24</b> may be used to package the full atomic and/or molecular circuit <b>50</b> by closing the window <b>24</b> by wafer bonding. The circuit <b>50</b> is then encapsulated in UHV.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Whilst there has been described in the foregoing description exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the technology concerned that many variations in details of design, construction and/or operation may be made without departing from the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Upon heating sorbitol for example with concentrated sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, two molecules of water are eliminated with the formation of isosorbide. So far, these compounds are also known generally as dianhydrohexitols (including besides isosorbide also the isomers isomannide and isoidide). Besides isosorbide per se, certain derivatives of isosorbide are well known, inter alia mono- and diesters thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Certain derivatives of isosorbide are known, especially esters or ethers thereof. Furthermore it is known to use isosorbide derivatives as additives in various applications, like detergents, cleansers or cosmetic compositions.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Provided herein are new additives, useful in detergents and cleansers, and based on isosorbide chemistry.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">The present application pertains in a first embodiment to an isosorbide glyceride according to general formula (I)</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00004" num="00004">
<img id="EMI-C00004" he="34.46mm" wi="73.58mm" file="US08420588-20130416-C00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
<br/>
wherein R or R&#x2032; represent a hydrogen atom, or an alkyl or an acyl group with 6 to 22 C-atoms, and n and m represent independent from each other zero, or a number from 1 to 4 with the proviso that the sum from n and m must be greater than zero. The compounds according to this general formula (I) are ethers of glycerol and isosorbide. They encompass both, mono- and diethers from isosorbide with glycerol, oligo-glycerol, and derivatives of glycerol, di- and oligo glycerol. The compounds may also be present as blends of different compounds of formula (I).
</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">Preferred derivatives are those, where R and/or R&#x2032; represents a linear, saturated alky moiety with 10 to 22, preferably 12 to 20, and most preferably 14 to 18 C-atoms. Furthermore, glycerides, i.e. the alkyl esters of glycerol or di- or oligo glycerol are preferred too. According to the way of preparation the compounds will contain besides the compounds of formula (I) lower amounts (i.e. &#x3c;5 wt %) of by products and unreacted matter.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">The preparation of the compounds according to formula (I) can be carried out by known processes starting from isosorbide glycidyl ethers, according to general formula (II)</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00005" num="00005">
<img id="EMI-C00005" he="25.65mm" wi="47.58mm" file="US08420588-20130416-C00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">For example, according to the teaching of U.S. Pat. No. 3,041,300 an isosorbide may be reacted with epichlorohydrin in the presence of basic catalysts to obtain bisglycidyl ether according to formula (II). In a second step this oxirane ether can be cleaved by adding strong acids, like H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and the solution is then neutralized. A second way to obtain such a product is the use of alkanols in the presence of a basic catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">A further embodiment of the invention pertains to the use of compounds according to formula (I) for the preparation of detergents, cleansers and the like (solid, liquid or gel-like ones) or the use of this compounds in cosmetic compositions. Furthermore, those preparations are subject matter of the present application as far as they contain water, and a surfactant and optional further common ingredients and at least one isosorbide derivate according to formula (I).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">The isosorbide glyceryl ether derivatives according to formula (I) may be present in amounts from 0.1 up to 25% by weight, dependent on the particular formulation. Preferably those detergents or cleanser will contain the monoesters in amounts of 1 to 15 wt %, and most preferred from 5 to 10 wt %, based on the total weight of the cleanser or is detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">The isosorbide derivatives according to formula (I) are particular useful in home care applications, like detergents, and all kind of cleaners (kitchen, bathroom, hard surface, automotive or car cleansers, and multipurpose cleansers), as well as in dishwashing compositions (hand and automatic dish washing) and in personal care compositions, especially in skin and hair cleansing formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">Detergents according to the invention may contain, besides the isosorbide glycerides surfactants, builders, salts, bleaching agents, bleach activators, optical brighteners, redeposition inhibitors, soil repellants, solubilizers, foam inhibitors and enzymes as auxiliaries and additives.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0020">The cleaners according to the invention may contain, for example, solubilizers, such as ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol or preferably butyl diglycol, foam regulators, for example soap, soluble builders, for example citric acid or sodium citrate, EDTA or NTA, and abrasives as auxiliaries. In many cases, an additional bactericidal effect is required so that the multipurpose cleaners may contain cationic surfactants or biocides, for example glucoprotamine. The cleaners according to the invention may be both alkaline (pH&#x3e;7.5) and acidic (pH&#x3c;6.5). The isosorbide glyceryl ether derivatives may be formulated with other surfactants, like anionic, nonionic, amphoteric and/or cationic surfactants.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021">Anionic surfactants according to the present invention include aliphatic sulfates, such as fatty alcohol sulfates, fatty alcohol ether sulfates, fatty acid polyglycol ester sulfates, dialkyl ether sulfates, monoglyceride sulfates and aliphatic sulfonates, such as alkane sulfonates, olefin sulfonates, ether sulfonates, n-alkyl ether sulfonates, ester sulfonates, and lignin sulfonates. Fatty acid cyanamides, sulfosuccinic acid esters, fatty acid isethionates, acylaminoalkane sulfonates (fatty acid taurides), fatty acid sarcosinates, ether carboxylic acids and alkyl (ether) phosphates may also be used for the purposes of the invention, but are not preferred. Preferred anionic surfactants in the sense of the present invention are selected from the group of fatty alcohol sulfates, fatty alcohol ether sulfates and/or fatty acid polyglycol ester sulfates, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">Typical examples of nonionic surfactants are alkoxylates of alkanols, end-capped alkoxylates of alkanols with no free OH groups, alkoxylated fatty acid lower alkyl esters, amine oxides, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers, fatty acid polyglycol esters, fatty acid amide polyglycol ethers, fatty amine polyglycol ethers, alkoxylated triglycerides, mixed ethers and mixed formals, fatty acid-N-alkyl glucamides, protein hydrolyzates (more particularly wheat-based vegetable products), polyol fatty acid esters, sugar esters, sorbitan esters and polysorbates. If the nonionic surfactants contain polyglycol ether chains, they may have a conventional homolog distribution although they preferably have a narrow homolog distribution. The other nonionic surfactants are preferably selected from the group consisting of alkoxylates of alkanols, more particularly fatty alcohol polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol ethers or fatty alcohol polypropylene glycol/polyethylene glycol ethers, end-capped alkoxylates of alkanols, more particularly end-capped fatty alcohol polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol ethers or end-capped fatty alcohol polypropylene glycol/polyethylene glycol ethers, and fatty acid lower alkyl esters and amine oxides. Alkyl and alkenyl oligoglycosides are known, and preferred, nonionic surfactants which correspond to formula R&#x2014;O&#x2014;[G]<sub>p </sub>in which R is an alkyl and/or alkenyl group containing 6 to 22 carbon atoms, G is a sugar unit containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms and p is a number of 1 to 10. They may be obtained by the relevant methods of preparative organic chemistry. The alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglycosides may be derived from aldoses or ketoses containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms, preferably glucose. Accordingly, the preferred alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglycosides are alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglucosides. The index p in general formula (V) indicates the degree of oligomerization (DP), i.e. the distribution of mono- and oligoglycosides, and is a number of 1 to 10. Whereas p in a given compound must always be an integer and, above all, may assume a value of 1 to 6, the value p for a certain alkyl oligoglycoside is an analytically determined calculated quantity which is generally a broken number. Alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglycosides having an average degree of oligomerization p of 1.1 to 3.0 are preferably used. Alkyl and/or alkenyl oligoglycosides having a degree of oligomerization of less than 1.7 and, more particularly, between 1.2 and 1.4 are preferred from the applicational point of view. The alkyl or alkenyl group R may be derived from primary alcohols containing 4 to 11 and preferably 8 to 10 carbon atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">Typical examples of cationic surfactants are quaternary ammonium compounds and quaternized fatty acid trialkanolamine esters.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">Typical examples of amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants are alkyl betaines, alkyl amidobetaines, aminopropionates, aminoglycinates, imidazolinium betaines and sulfobetaines.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">The isosorbide glyceryl ether derivatives according to the present application show advantageous properties in detergents, due to their foaming properties. They could also show interesting moisturizing properties which makes it possible to use it in cosmetic preparations too.</p>

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Preparation of the Isosorbide Bisglycidylether</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">A vessel was charged with 73.5 g isosorbide and 370 g epichlorohydrin. The solution was heated to 115&#xb0; C. During a period of 10 h 81 g of a 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution were added incrementally to the boiling reaction mixture. During the reaction water and epichlorohydrin were distilled from the reaction mixture. Then the water phase was separated and then distilled to remove unreacted epichlorohydrin at 150 &#xb0; C. under vakuum. To separate the salt from the crude product acetone was added under stirring and the mixture was filtered. After washing a further distillation step took place to remove the acetone. Isosorbide bisglycidyl ether was obtained.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Preparation of Isosorbide Diglyceride</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">A solution of 83 mmol isosorbide bisglycidyl ether (26.9 g) in 22 ml water is prepared at room temperature (21&#xb0; C.). 2 ml H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>(30 wt.-%) is added dropwise. After 1 h, 11 mmol (0.8 g) Ca(OH)<sub>2 </sub>is added for neutralization. The reaction mixture is then filtered and water is removed under vacuum to yield a light yellow oil (Yield: 20 g)</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">This polyol can then be esterified according to state of the art methods in order to give the isosorbid glyceryl ether esters.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">A second way to obtain the glyceryl derivatives of isosorbide is the opening of the oxirane of the bisglycidyl ether via reaction with a fatty alcohol. For this reason 326 mmol of isosorbide bisglycidyl ether (75 g) is added dropwise to a solution of 1 mol dodecanol (182 g) and as catalyst potasium hydroxide (3.65 g, 65 mmol) at 100&#xb0; C. Once the reaction is completed, the mixture is filtered, and the non-reacted dodecanol is removed under vacuum to give a yellow paste (Yield: 48 g)</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to novel heterocyclic carboxamide compounds, the use of such compounds as inhibitors of protein kinase B (hereinafter PKB/Akt, PKB or Akt) activity and in the treatment of cancer and arthritis.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to heterocyclic carboxamide containing compounds that are inhibitors of the activity of one or more of the isoforms of the serine/threonine kinase, Akt (also known as protein kinase B). The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and methods of using the instant compounds in the treatment of cancer and arthritis (Liu et al. <i>Current Opin. Pharmacology </i>3:317-22 (2003)).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays essential roles in embryonic development and pathogenesis of various diseases, such as degenerative neuronal diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Recent work has led to the identification of various pro- and anti-apoptotic gene products that are involved in the regulation or execution of programmed cell death. Expression of anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl2 or Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, inhibits apoptotic cell death induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, expression of pro-apoptotic genes, such as Bax or Bad, leads to programmed cell death (Adams et al. <i>Science, </i>281:1322-1326 (1998)). The execution of programmed cell death is mediated by caspase-1 related proteinases, including caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8 and caspase-9 etc (Thornberry et al. <i>Science, </i>281:1312-1316 (1998)).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The phosphatidylinositol 3&#x2032;-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt/PKB pathway appears important for regulating cell survival/cell death (Kulik et al. <i>Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>17:1595-1606 (1997); Franke et al, <i>Cell, </i>88:435-437 (1997); Kauffmann-Zeh et al. <i>Nature </i>385:544-548 (1997) Hemmings <i>Science, </i>275:628-630 (1997); Dudek et al., <i>Science, </i>275:661-665 (1997)). Survival factors, such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), promote cell survival under various conditions by inducing the activity of PI3K (Kulik et al. 1997, Hemmings 1997). Activated PI3K leads to the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PtdIns (3,4,5)-P3), which in turn binds to, and promotes the activation of, the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which contains a pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain (Franke et al <i>Cell, </i>81:727-736 (1995); Hemmings <i>Science, </i>277:534 (1997); Downward, <i>Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. </i>10:262-267 (1998), Alessi et al., <i>EMBO J. </i>15: 6541-6551 (1996)). Specific inhibitors of PI3K or dominant negative Akt/PKB mutants abolish survival-promoting activities of these growth factors or cytokines. It has been previously disclosed that inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002 or wortmannin) blocked the activation of Akt/PKB by upstream kinases. In addition, introduction of constitutively active PI3K or Akt/PKB mutants promotes cell survival under conditions in which cells normally undergo apoptotic cell death (Kulik et al. 1997, Dudek et al. 1997).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Analysis of Akt levels in human tumors showed that Akt2 is overexpressed in a significant number of ovarian (J. Q. Cheung et al. <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </i>89:9267-9271 (1992)) and pancreatic cancers (J. Q. Cheung et al. <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </i>93:3636-3641 (1996)). Similarly, Akt3 was found to be overexpressed in breast and prostate cancer cell lines (Nakatani et al. <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>274:21528-21532 (1999). It was demonstrated that Akt-2 was over-expressed in 12% of ovarian carcinomas and that amplification of Akt was especially frequent in 50% of undifferentiated tumors, suggestion that Akt may also be associated with tumor aggressiveness (Bellacosa, et al., <i>Int. J. Cancer, </i>64, pp. 280-285, 1995). Increased Akt1 kinase activity has been reported in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers (Sun et al. <i>Am. J. Pathol. </i>159: 431-7 (2001)).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The tumor suppressor PTEN, a protein and lipid phosphatase that specifically removes the 3&#x2032; phosphate of PtdIns(3,4,5)-P3, is a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Li et al. <i>Science </i>275:1943-1947 (1997), Stambolic et al. <i>Cell </i>95:29-39 (1998), Sun et al. <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </i>96:6199-6204 (1999)). Germline mutations of PTEN are responsible for human cancer syndromes such as Cowden disease (Liaw et al. <i>Nature Genetics </i>16:64-67 (1997)). PTEN is deleted in a large percentage of human tumors and tumor cell lines without functional PTEN show elevated levels of activated Akt (Li et al. supra, Guldberg et al. <i>Cancer Research </i>57:3660-3663 (1997), Risinger et al. <i>Cancer Research </i>57:4736-4738 (1997)).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These observations demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays important roles for regulating cell survival or apoptosis in tumorigenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Three members of the Akt/PKB subfamily of second-messenger regulated serine/threonine protein kinases have been identified and termed Akt1/PKB&#x3b1;, Akt2/PKB&#x3b2;, and Akt3/PKB&#x3b3; respectively. The isoforms are homologous, particularly in regions encoding the catalytic domains. Akt/PKBs are activated by phosphorylation events occurring in response to PI3K signaling. PI3K phosphorylates membrane inositol phospholipids, generating the second messengers phosphatidyl-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, which have been shown to bind to the PH domain of Akt/PKB. The current model of Akt/PKB activation proposes recruitment of the enzyme to the membrane by 3&#x2032;-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, where phosphorylation of the regulatory sites of Akt/PKB by the upstream kinases occurs (B. A. Hemmings, <i>Science </i>275:628-630 (1997); B. A. Hemmings, <i>Science </i>276:534 (1997); J. Downward, <i>Science </i>279:673-674 (1998)).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Phosphorylation of Akt1/PKB&#x3b1; occurs on two regulatory sites, Thr<sup>308 </sup>in the catalytic domain activation loop and on Ser<sup>473 </sup>near the carboxy terminus (D. R. Alessi et al. <i>EMBO J. </i>15:6541-6551 (1996) and R. Meier et al. <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>272:30491-30497 (1997)). Equivalent regulatory phosphorylation sites occur in Akt2/PKB&#x3b2; and Akt3/PKB&#x3b3;. The upstream kinase, which phosphorylates Akt/PKB at the activation loop site has been cloned and termed 3&#x2032;-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). PDK1 phosphorylates not only Akt/PKB, but also p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, p90RSK, serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK), and protein kinase C. The upstream kinase phosphorylating the regulatory site of Akt/PKB near the carboxy terminus has not been identified yet, but recent reports imply a role for the integrin-linked kinase (ILK-1), a serine/threonine protein kinase, or autophosphorylation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Inhibition of Akt activation and activity can be achieved by inhibiting PI3K with inhibitors such as LY294002 and wortmannin. However, PI3K inhibition has the potential to indiscriminately affect not just all three Akt isozymes but also other PH domain-containing signaling molecules that are dependent on PdtIns(3,4,5)-P3, such as the Tec family of tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, it has been disclosed that Akt can be activated by growth signals that are independent of PI3K.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Alternatively, Akt activity can be inhibited by blocking the activity of the upstream kinase PDK1. The compound UCN-01 is a reported inhibitor of PDK1. <i>Biochem. J. </i>375(2):255 (2003). Again, inhibition of PDK1 would result in inhibition of multiple protein kinases whose activities depend on PDK1, such as atypical PKC isoforms, SGK, and S6 kinases (Williams et al. <i>Curr.

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Small molecule inhibitors of Akt are useful in the treatment of tumors, especially those with activated Akt (e.g. PTEN null tumors and tumors with ras mutations). PTEN is a critical negative regulator of Akt and its function is lost in many cancers, including breast and prostate carcinomas, glioblastomas, and several cancer syndromes including Bannayan-Zonana syndrome (Maehama, T. et al. <i>Annual Review of Biochemistry, </i>70: 247 (2001)), Cowden disease (Parsons, R.; Simpson, L. <i>Methods in Molecular Biology </i>(Totowa, N.J., United States), 222 (<i>Tumor Suppressor Genes, Volume </i>1): 147 (2003)), and Lhermitte-Duclos disease (Backman, S. et al. <i>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, </i>12(5): 516 (2002)). Akt3 is up-regulated in estrogen receptor-deficient breast cancers and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines and Akt2 is over-expressed in pancreatic and ovarian carcinomas. Akt1 is amplified in gastric cancers (Staal, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>84: 5034-7 (1987) and upregulated in breast cancers (Stal et al. <i>Breast Cancer Res. </i>5: R37-R44 (2003)). Therefore a small molecule Akt inhibitor is expected to be useful for the treatment of these types of cancer as well as other types of cancer. Akt inhibitors are also useful in combination with further chemotherapeutic agents.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0082">Amino alcohol (I-1) was reacted under Mitsunobu conditions to provide the differentially protected diamine (I-2). Mitsunobu reactions are well know to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Methods and reaction conditions for such transformations are discussed in <i>Synthesis </i>1981, 1-28. Selective deprotection of the phthalimide group of (I-2) using a nucleophilic amine such as hydrazine or methyl amine in a polar solvent such as methanol, afforded amine (I-3). Many different protecting groups are available to one skilled in the art and can be used here as long as they do not interfere with the processes listed herein. Methods for the protection of amines are described in standard reference volumes, such as Greene &#x201c;Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis&#x201d; (published by Wiley-Interscience).</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0084">Carboxylic acid (II-1) was reacted with 1,1-dimethylethyl (2-amino-3-phenylpropyl)carbamate to form amide (II-2). A variety of amide coupling reagents such as EDC, PyBrop, etc. are commercially available. Amide coupling reactions are generally run in solvents such as DCM or DMF, utilizing an organic base like Et<sub>3</sub>N or (i-Pr)<sub>2</sub>NEt. Bromide (II-2) was coupled with 1-methyl-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-1H-pyrazole using a Suzuki coupling procedure. Suzuki-like couplings are typically run using a palladium(0) catalyst such as Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4 </sub>with an inorganic base, for example K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>or K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, in an aqueous mixture containing ethereal solvents such as DME, dioxane, or THF. Methods for palladium-mediated couplings are described in standard reference volumes, such as Schlosser &#x201c;Organometallics in Synthesis&#x201d; (published by Wiley and sons). Acidic treatment of II-3 with HCl or TFA to remove the Boc protecting group produced amine (II-4). Many different protecting groups are available to one skilled in the art and can be used here as long as they do not interfere with the processes listed herein. Methods for the protection of amines are described in standard reference volumes, such as Greene &#x201c;Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis&#x201d; (published by Wiley-Interscience).</p>

The term further active ingredient or ingredients, as used herein, includes any compound or therapeutic agent known to or that demonstrates advantageous properties when administered to a patient in need of treatment for cancer or arthritis. Preferably, if the administration is not simultaneous, the compounds are administered in a close time proximity to each other. Furthermore, it does not matter if the compounds are administered in the same dosage form, e.g. one compound may be administered topically and another compound may be administered orally.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0086">Typically, any anti-neoplastic agent that has activity versus a susceptible tumor being treated may be co-administered in the treatment of cancer in the present invention. Examples of such agents can be found in Cancer Principles and Practice of Oncology by V. T. Devita and S. Hellman (editors), 6<sup>th </sup>edition (Feb. 15, 2001), Lippincott Williams &#x26; Wilkins Publishers. A person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to discern which combinations of agents would be useful based on the particular characteristics of the drugs and the cancer involved.

Chem., Soc., 93:2325. 1971), who characterized its structure by chemical and X-ray crystallographic methods. One mechanism for its activity relates to paclitaxel's capacity to bind tubulin, thereby inhibiting cancer cell growth. Schiff et al., Proc. Natl, Acad, Sci.

<p id="p-0098" num="0130">Signal transduction pathway inhibitors are those inhibitors, which block or inhibit a chemical process which evokes an intracellular change. As used herein this change is cell proliferation or differentiation. Signal tranduction inhibitors useful in the present invention include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, SH2/SH3 domain blockers, serine/threonine kinases, phosphotidyl inositol-3 kinases, myo-inositol signaling, and Ras oncogenes.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0131">Several protein tyrosine kinases catalyse the phosphorylation of specific tyrosyl residues in various proteins involved in the regulation of cell growth. Such protein tyrosine kinases can be broadly classified as receptor or non-receptor kinases.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0132">Receptor tyrosine kinases are transmembrane proteins having an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and a tyrosine kinase domain. Receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in the regulation of cell growth and are generally termed growth factor receptors. Inappropriate or uncontrolled activation of many of these kinases, i.e. aberrant kinase growth factor receptor activity, for example by over-expression or mutation, has been shown to result in uncontrolled cell growth. Accordingly, the aberrant activity of such kinases has been linked to malignant tissue growth. Consequently, inhibitors of such kinases could provide cancer treatment methods. Growth factor receptors include, for example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFr), erbB2, erbB4, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFr), tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and epidermal growth factor homology domains (TIE-2), insulin growth factor-I (IGFI) receptor, macrophage colony stimulating factor (cfms), BTK, ckit, cmet, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors, Trk receptors (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC), ephrin (eph) receptors, and the RET protooncogene. Several inhibitors of growth receptors are under development and include ligand antagonists, antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and anti-sense oligonucleotides. Growth factor receptors and agents that inhibit growth factor receptor function are described, for instance, in Kath, John C., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents (2000) 10(6):803-818; Shawver et al DDT Vol 2, No. 2 Feb. 1997; and Lofts, F. J. et al, &#x201c;Growth factor receptors as targets&#x201d;, New Molecular Targets for Cancer Chemotherapy, ed.

<p id="p-0104" num="0136">Inhibitors of Phosphotidyl inositol-3 Kinase family members including blockers of PI3-kinase, ATM, DNA-PK, and Ku may also be useful in the present invention. Such kinases are discussed in Abraham, R. T. (1996), Current Opinion in Immunology. 8 (3) 412-8; Canman, C. E., Lim, D. S. (1998), Oncogene 17 (25) 3301-3308; Jackson, S. P.

<p id="p-0105" num="0137">Also of interest in the present invention are Myo-inositol signaling inhibitors such as phospholipase C blockers and Myoinositol analogues. Such signal inhibitors are described in Powis, G., and Kozikowski A., (1994) New Molecular Targets for Cancer Chemotherapy ed., Paul Workman and David Kerr, CRC press 1994, London.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0138">Another group of signal transduction pathway inhibitors are inhibitors of Ras Oncogene. Such inhibitors include inhibitors of farnesyltransferase, geranyl-geranyl transferase, and CAAX proteases as well as anti-sense oligonucleotides, ribozymes and immunotherapy. Such inhibitors have been shown to block ras activation in cells containing wild type mutant ras, thereby acting as antiproliferation agents. Ras oncogene inhibition is discussed in Scharovsky, O. G., Rozados, V. R., Gervasoni, S. I. Matar, P. (2000), Journal of Biomedical Science. 7(4) 292-8; Ashby, M. N. (1998), Current Opinion in Lipidology. 9 (2) 99-102; and BioChim. Biophys. Acta, (19899) 1423(3):19-30.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0139">As mentioned above, antibody antagonists to receptor kinase ligand binding may also serve as signal transduction inhibitors. This group of signal transduction pathway inhibitors includes the use of humanized antibodies to the extracellular ligand binding domain of receptor tyrosine kinases. For example lmclone C225 EGFR specific antibody (see Green, M. C. et al, Monoclonal Antibody Therapy for Solid Tumors, Cancer Treat. Rev., (2000), 26(4), 269-286); Herceptin&#xae; erbB2 antibody (see Tyrosine Kinase Signalling in Breast cancer:erbB Family Receptor Tyrosine Kniases, Breast cancer Res., 2000, 2(3), 176-183); and 2CB VEGFR2 specific antibody (see Brekken, R. A. et al, Selective Inhibition of VEGFR2 Activity by a monoclonal Anti-VEGF antibody blocks tumor growth in mice, Cancer Res. (2000) 60, 5117-5124).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0140">Non-receptor kinase angiogenesis inhibitors may also be useful in the present invention. Inhibitors of angiogenesis related VEGFR and TIE2 are discussed above in regard to signal transduction inhibitors (both receptors are receptor tyrosine kinases). Angiogenesis in general is linked to erbB2/EGFR signaling since inhibitors of erbB2 and EGFR have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis, primarily VEGF expression. Accordingly, non-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention. For example, anti-VEGF antibodies, which do not recognize VEGFR (the receptor tyrosine kinase), but bind to the ligand; small molecule inhibitors of integrin (alpha<sub>v </sub>beta<sub>3</sub>) that will inhibit angiogenesis; endostatin and angiostatin (non-RTK) may also prove useful in combination with the disclosed compounds. (See Bruns C J et al (2000), Cancer Res., 60: 2926-2935; Schreiber A B, Winkler M E, and Derynck R. (1986), Science, 232: 1250-1253; Yen L et al. (2000), Oncogene 19: 3460-3469).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0141">Agents used in immunotherapeutic regimens may also be useful in combination with the compounds of formula (I). There are a number of immunologic strategies to generate an immune response. These strategies are generally in the realm of tumor vaccinations. The efficacy of immunologic approaches may be greatly enhanced through combined inhibition of signaling pathways using a small molecule inhibitor. Discussion of the immunologic/tumor vaccine approach against erbB2/EGFR are found in Reilly R T et al. (2000), Cancer Res. 60: 3569-3576; and Chen Y, Hu D, Eling D J, Robbins J, and Kipps T J. (1998), Cancer Res. 58: 1965-1971.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0142">Agents used in proapoptotic regimens (e.g., bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides) may also be used in the combination of the present invention. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins block apoptosis. Upregulation of bcl-2 has therefore been linked to chemoresistance. Studies have shown that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates anti-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family (i.e., mol-1). Therefore, strategies designed to downregulate the expression of bcl-2 in tumors have demonstrated clinical benefit and are now in Phase II/III trials, namely Genta's G3139 bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide. Such proapoptotic strategies using the antisense oligonucleotide strategy for bcl-2 are discussed in Water J S et al. (2000), J. Clin. Oncol. 18: 1812-1823; and Kitada S et al. (1994), Antisense Res. Dev. 4: 71-79.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0143">Cell cycle signalling inhibitors inhibit molecules involved in the control of the cell cycle. A family of protein kinases called cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and their interaction with a family of proteins termed cyclins controls progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle. The coordinate activation and inactivation of different cyclin/CDK complexes is necessary for normal progression through the cell cycle. Several inhibitors of cell cycle signalling are under development. For instance, examples of cyclin dependent kinases, including CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 and inhibitors for the same are described in, for instance, Rosania et al, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents (2000) 10(2):215-230.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to a method for maintaining or improving skin health in wearers of absorbent articles such as diapers, training pants, adult incontinence devices, feminine hygiene products, and the like. More particularly, the application relates to a method comprising the repeated use of absorbent articles that deliver a composition to the wearer's skin, so as to provide a skin protective barrier and/or a therapeutic benefit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many types of disposable absorbent products, such as diapers, are available that have a high capacity for absorbing urine and other body exudates. Disposable products of this type generally comprise some sort of liquid-pervious topsheet material, an absorbent core, and a liquid-impervious backsheet material. Although these types of absorbent structures may be highly efficient for the absorption of liquids, it is well recognized that long-term wear of such structures may lead to skin which is compromised in terms of being over hydrated or exposed to skin irritants commonly found in body exudates. It is generally known that skin under absorbent articles is more susceptible to skin disorders, including diaper rash, erythema (i.e., redness), heat rash, abrasion, pressure marks and skin barrier loss. For example, 21 C.F.R. 333.503 defines diaper rash as &#x201c;[a]n inflammatory skin condition in the diaper area (perineum, buttocks, lower abdomen, and inner thighs) caused by one or more of the following factors: moisture, occlusion, chafing, continued contact with urine or feces or both, or mechanical or chemical irritation.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To address the concerns of skin disorders associated with wearing absorbent articles, the caregiver often applies skin protective products such as Vaseline&#xae;, medicated ointments, powders, etc. to the buttocks, genitals, anal and/or other regions before placing the absorbent article on the wearer. This procedure usually involves the caregiver applying the skin protective to their hands, and then wiping the same on the skin of the infant. To eliminate the need for this wasteful, messy, time-consuming, and easily forgotten procedure, there have been attempts to prepare absorbent articles which contain a protective or therapeutic skin care substance on the article's topsheet.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 3,585,998 to Hayford et al. teaches a disposable baby diaper, an interior liner of which carries an array of pressure-rupturable capsules containing baby oil. The patent teaches that it is desirable to break the capsules prior to using the diaper by applying pressure with such household items as a rolling pin, hand iron, etc. Articles disclosed by this patent have serious drawbacks. Namely, unless the capsules are ruptured by applying pressure prior to using the diaper or the bandage, the skin-care substance contained in the capsules is either not delivered at all or is delivered non-uniformly leaving some areas of skin uncoated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 3,489,148 to Duncan et al. teaches a baby diaper comprising a hydrophobic and oleophobic topsheet wherein a portion of the topsheet is coated with a discontinuous film of oleaginous material. A major disadvantage of the diapers disclosed in the Duncan et al. reference is that the hydrophobic and oleophobic topsheets are slow in promoting transfer of urine to the underlying absorbent cores.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,588 to Roe et al. addresses some of the concerns presented by prior absorbent articles which were designed to deliver a skin protective material. In particular, Roe describes an absorbent article whose topsheet is surface treated with a lotion that comprises an emollient for facilitating easier cleaning of feces and other exudates and an agent which immobilizes the lotion so that it does not migrate from the point of initial application.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While the prior art describes articles designed to deliver compositions to provide skin care benefits, the prior art has failed to describe a regimen which results in maintained or improved skin health in regions of the wearer's body covered by absorbent articles, where the regimen does not require intervention from the caregiver in the form of manual application of skin care compositions. That is, the prior art has not recognized the importance of the repeated use of absorbent articles that automatically deliver sufficient levels of a composition to the wearer's skin that allows the maintenance or improvement of skin health in the region of the wearer covered by the absorbent article.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a method: (1) wherein the condition of skin covered by the absorbent article is maintained in a natural, healthy condition or improved to a more healthy condition; and (2) that does not require intervention by the wearer or caregiver in the form of manual application of skin care agents.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for maintaining or improving the skin health of an absorbent article wearer comprising repeated application of disposable absorbent articles that automatically deliver sufficient levels of a composition. In this regard, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method that comprises the application of absorbent articles which have a composition on a wearer-contacting surface, where the composition is transferable to the wearer's skin and is effective at maintaining or improving skin health.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other objects are obtained in accordance with the present invention, as will become readily apparent upon reading the following disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">I. Definitions</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0020">As used herein, the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; means that the various components, ingredients, or steps, can be conjointly employed in practicing the present invention. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; encompasses the more restrictive terms &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0021">As used herein, the term &#x201c;maintained&#x201d; skin health means to preserve the natural state of healthy skin. The term &#x201c;improved&#x201d; skin health refers to a reduction in the extent of adverse skin effects. These terms describe skin health in the area covered by absorbent articles. It will be recognized that the methods of the present invention may both maintain and improve skin health in different regions of an individual wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0022">As used herein, the term &#x201c;skin care composition&#x201d; refers to any composition which comprises one or more agents which, when transferred from an article to a wearer's skin, provide a therapeutic and/or protective skin benefit. Representative materials are discussed in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0023">As used herein, the term &#x201c;treated article&#x201d; means an absorbent article having a skin care composition on or migratable to at least one wearer-contacting surface of that article. An &#x201c;equivalent article that does not comprise a skin care composition&#x201d; is an article that is substantially the same as a treated article, in terms of topsheet, backsheet, absorbent core, chassis design, cuffs, etc., but which does not comprise a skin care composition that is transferred to the wearer during use.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0024">As used herein, the term &#x201c;wearer-contacting surface&#x201d; of an absorbent article is one or more surfaces of any article components that contact the wearer at some time during the wear period. Wearer contacting surfaces include, but are not limited to, portions of the topsheet, leg cuffs, waist region, side panels, fastening tabs, etc., which contact a wearer during use.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0025">Other terms are defined in the specification where initially discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0026">With respect to the skin care composition, all percentages, ratios and proportions used herein are by weight unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">II. Methods for Maintaining and/or Improving Skin Health</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0027">As discussed, the adverse skin effects that result from the occlusive nature of current absorbent articles are well recognized. Efforts have been made to overcome these negative attributes by preparing articles that deliver beneficial compositions. However, Applicants are the first to recognize the benefit of a method comprising frequent cycles of cumulative delivery of a skin care composition to the wearer's skin to maintain or improve skin health. In this regard, the present invention relates to a method for maintaining or improving skin health in the area covered by an absorbent article, the method comprising the following steps:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0028">(a) applying to the wearer an absorbent article having a skin care composition that provides a therapeutic and/or protective skin benefit upon transfer to the skin;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0029">(b) transferring to the wearer at least a portion of the skin care composition during wear; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0030">(c) repeating steps (a) and (b) with one or more additional articles with sufficient frequency to maintain or improve the health of the skin covered by the absorbent article relative to the skin covered by an equivalent absorbent article that does not comprise the skin care composition, and without the need for manual application of skin protective agents (e.g., by the caregiver or wearer).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">Applicants have discovered that, surprisingly, maintaining or improving health skin under absorbent articles can be accomplished coincidentally (or &#x201c;automatically&#x201d;) with repeated use, over a period of time (e.g., several days), of absorbent articles that are treated with a composition that is transferred to the wearer under normal usage conditions (e.g., contact, movement, handling by the caregiver after application of the article, body heat, etc.). Thus, while prior attempts to address skin disorders associated with wearing absorbent articles have generally described steps (a) or (b) of the present method, none of those attempts appreciated the importance of step (c), corresponding to frequent cycles of cumulative delivery of a skin care composition to the wearer's skin to maintain or improve skin health. Applicants have further discovered that delivery of relatively low levels of the composition with each article wear are sufficient to obtain the skin benefits resulting from this novel method of cumulative composition delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">The article used in the present methods provides an available source from which the skin care composition transfers onto the skin continuously over time. As the composition is transferred, it accumulates on the skin surface to initiate and maintain its protective activity. As a used article is discarded and replaced by a new one, this cycle is repeated for further composition accumulation above and beyond what a single or original article would have delivered on its own. Certain of the ingredients for use in the composition are known to penetrate the stratum corneum (e.g., petrolatum, which is preferred for use herein). Thus, even as some amount of the composition is removed by cleaning, bathing, etc., or even if usage of treated articles as described herein is discontinued temporarily, some of the benefits of the skin composition will remain with the user. As usage of treated articles is resumed before all of the benefits of the composition have dissipated, the user will derive benefits, in terms of reduced erythema and/or rash, more rapidly than would a user who has not used treated articles.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">As indicated above, it is generally recognized that skin under absorbent articles is more susceptible to degradation of that skin's condition. Typically, cutaneous manifestations of these skin conditions include redness (also referred to as erythema) and/or rash. As such, Applicants describe herein a method for maintaining or improving skin health in regions covered by an absorbent article, wherein the desired endpoint of the method is the reduction or avoidance of erythema and/or rash when compared to skin covered by an equivalent absorbent article that does not comprise the skin care composition.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">Erythema and rash are the most common and well documented adverse medical conditions present on skin covered by absorbent articles. These conditions are readily assessed by expert skin graders. Hence the protocol for assessing the maintenance or improvement of skin health relies on assessment of rash and/or erythema. The protocol for assessing reduction or avoidance of rash and/or erythema provided by the methods of the present invention are described in detail in the Test Methods section below. In brief, the objective of the protocol is to determine whether use of a test article reduces the frequency and/or severity of skin rash and/or erythema in the diapered skin regions compared to an equivalent, untreated article. The test method involves comparisons of end point parameters between 2 groups of subjects who are assigned to wear the test or the control product for 3 consecutive weeks (a baseline week in which all subjects use the same control product is included prior to initiating the 3-week product comparison portion of the study). Per this approach, the skin in the diapered region of the users of the articles is examined twice per week at 3-4 day intervals by a clinical evaluator trained to evaluate diaper rash and erythema using a defined scale. At the completion of the study, the frequency and severity of diaper rash and erythema are compared between the test and control product groups using appropriate statistical procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0035">In one aspect, the improvement manifests itself as a statistically significant reduction in erythema and/or rash at a 90% confidence level, relative to skin covered an equivalent absorbent article that does not comprise the skin care composition. In this regard, it is preferable that the reduction or will manifest itself at a 95% confidence level.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0036">Separately, it is recognized that one may observe large between-group differences (i.e., in the mean) in rash and/or erythema scores, yet due to large inter-subject variability fail to observe traditional statistically significant differences. In this regard, improvements of at least about 10% between group (control and test) means, though not necessarily statistical, may be recognized and appreciated by caregivers and users as providing skin care benefits. In this regard, the methods of the present invention will result in improvements in rash or erythema scores of at least about 10%, more preferably at least about 15%, still more preferably at least about 20%.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0037">For purposes of the present disclosure, statistical or non-statistical improvements, defined above, in skin condition with regard to either erythema or rash at one or more wearer regions for the study group as a whole, or any gender or age or size subset of the study group, as described in the Test Method section, are considered to provide the desired skin benefits of the present invention. Preferably, the methods of the present invention will provide both erythema and rash benefits, at one or more wearer regions as described in the Test Method section.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">III. Skin Care Composition</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038">While the specific composition(s) delivered (referred to herein as &#x201c;skin care composition&#x201d; and &#x201c;composition&#x201d;) in accordance with the present method is not the critical factor in achieving maintained skin condition of the area under absorbent articles, it is apparent that the composition must provide either a protective, nonocclusive function (e.g., a relatively liquid impervious but vapor pervious barrier) to avoid skin hyperhydration and skin exposure to materials contained in body exudates, or it must contain agents that deliver, either directly or indirectly, skin care benefits. For example, indirect benefits include improved removal of skin irritants such as feces or urine. The composition may be in a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, emulsions, lotions, creams, ointments, salves, powders, suspensions, encapsulations, gels, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0039">As used herein, the term &#x201c;effective amount of a skin care composition&#x201d; refers to an amount of a particular composition which, when applied or migrated to one or more of the wearer-contacting surface(s) of an absorbent article(s), will be effective in providing a protective barrier and/or delivering a skin care benefit when delivered via absorbent articles over time. Of course, the effective amount of composition applied to the article will depend, to a large extent, on the particular composition used. Nonetheless, the quantity of the composition on at least a portion of the wearer-contacting surface of the absorbent article will preferably range from about 0.05 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.0078 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 80 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(12 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), more preferably from about 1 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.16 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 40 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(6 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), still more preferably from about 4 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.6 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 26 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(4 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>). These ranges are by way of illustration only and the skilled artisan will recognize that the nature of the composition will dictate the level that must be applied to achieve the desired skin benefits, and that such levels are ascertainable by routine experimentation in light of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040">While the level of skin care composition applied to the absorbent article is an important aspect of the present methods, more important is the amount of composition transferred to the wearer's skin during use of one or more treated articles. Though the requisite level delivered to the skin to provide the desired skin benefits will depend to some degree on the nature of the composition employed, Applicants have found that relatively low levels may be delivered while still providing the desired skin effects. This is particularly true for preferred compositions, such as that described in Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">Another benefit of the present method is the controlled application of the skin care composition to deliver the low but effective levels of composition required. This is in contrast to typically sporadic manual application of skin care agents, where the caregiver/user often applies significantly greater levels of material than are needed. Excessive materials added manually may adversely impact the fluid handling properties of the absorbent article, as a result of transfer from the skin to the article. Indeed, for certain materials, such as petrolatum, the levels applied manually may actually result in an occlusive effect, thereby compromising the skin. A benefit of the present methods is providing a barrier to surface moisture while avoiding occlusion of the skin (i.e., maintaining skin breathability). Thus, the present methods, which allow controlled composition delivery throughout the wear period, allow transfer of optimal levels of the composition to the skin to maintain and/or improve skin health.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">The method for determining the amount of skin care composition transferred to a wearer's skin after wearing one or more treated articles is described in the Test Methods section below. With regard to the level of skin care composition that is transferred to the wearer during use of one treated absorbent article worn for a period of about 3 hours (a typical daytime wear time), particularly for preferred skin care compositions such as that described in Example 1, preferred is where at least about 0.01 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.0016 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), more preferably at least about 0.05 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.0078 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), still more preferably at least about 0.1 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.016 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), of the composition is transferred to the skin over a three hour wear period. Typically, the amount of composition delivered by one treated article will be from about 0.01 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.0016 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 5 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.78 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), more preferably from about 0.05 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.0078 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 3 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.47 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), still more preferably from about 0.1 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.016 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 2 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.31 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), over a three hour wear period.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043">For continual use of treated articles (in other words, changes occur in accordance with normal use patterns, which typically include changes every 3 to 4 hours during the day and a fresh article before overnight sleep) such as for a period of 24 hours, it will be preferred that at least about 0.03 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.0047 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), more preferably at least about 0.1 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.016 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), still more preferably at least about 0.3 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.047 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), of the composition is transferred to the wearer's skin over the 24 hour period. Typically, the amount of composition delivered after a period of 24 hours where treated articles are applied at each change, will be from about 0.03 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.0047 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 18 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(2.79 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), more typically from about 0.1 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.016 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 10 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(1.55 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), still more typically from about 0.3 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.047 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 6 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.93 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">It will be recognized that of the numerous materials useful in the skin care compositions delivered to skin in accordance with the present methods, those that have been deemed safe and effective skin care agents are logical materials for use herein. Such materials include Category I actives as defined by the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Tentative Final Monograph on Skin Protectant Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (21 C.F.R. &#xa7;347), which presently include: alantoin, aluminum hydroxide gel, calamine, cocoa butter, dimethicone, cod liver oil (in combination), glycerine, kaolin, petrolatum, lanolin, mineral oil, shark liver oil, white petrolatum, talc, topical starch, zinc acetate, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide, and the like. Other potentially useful materials are Category III actives as defined by the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration's Tentative Final Monograph on Skin Protectant Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (21 C.F.R. &#xa7;347), which presently include: live yeast cell derivatives, aldioxa, aluminum acetate, microporous cellulose, cholecalciferol, colloidal oatmeal, cysteine hydrochloride, dexpanthanol, Peruvean balsam oil, protein hydrolysates, racemic methionine, sodium bicarbonate, Vitamin A, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0045">Many of the FDA monographed skin care ingredients are currently utilized in commercially available skin care products, such as A and D&#xae; Ointment, Vaseline&#xae; Petroleum Jelly, Desitin&#xae; Diaper Rash Ointment and Daily Care&#xae; ointment, Gold Bond&#xae; Medicated Baby Powder, Aquaphor &#xae; Healing Ointment, Baby Magic&#xae; Baby Lotion, Johnson's Ultra Sensitive&#xae; Baby Cream. These commercial products may be applied to absorbent articles to create treated articles for use in the present methods, either with or without modification of the product to facilitate delivery via this novel method.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0046">As will be discussed hereinafter, the skin care compositions useful in the methods of the present invention preferably, though not necessarily, have a melting profile such that they are relatively immobile and localized on the wearer-contacting surface of the article at room temperature, are readily transferable to the wearer at body temperature, and yet are not completely liquid under extreme storage conditions. Preferably, the compositions are easily transferable to the skin by way of normal contact, wearer motion, and/or body heat. Because the composition preferably is substantially immobilized on the article's wearer-contacting surface, relatively low levels of composition are needed to impart the desired skin care benefits. In addition, special barrier or wrapping materials may be unnecessary in packaging the treated articles useful in the methods of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047">In a preferred embodiment, the skin care compositions useful herein are solid, or more often semi-solid, at 20&#xb0; C., i.e. at ambient temperatures. By &#x201c;semisolid&#x201d; is meant that the composition has a rheology typical of pseudoplastic or plastic liquids. When no shear is applied, the compositions can have the appearance of a semi-solid but can be made to flow as the shear rate is increased. This is due to the fact that, while the composition contains primarily solid components, it also includes some minor liquid components. Preferably, the compositions of the present invention have a zero shear viscosity between about 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>centipoise and about 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>8</sup>. More preferably, the zero shear viscosity is between about 5.0&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>centipoise and about 5.0&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>centipoise. As used herein the term &#x201c;zero shear viscosity&#x201d; refers to a viscosity measured at very low shear rates (e.g., 1.0 sec<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) using plate and cone viscometer (a suitable instrument is available fom TA Instruments of New Castle, Del. as model number CSL 100). One of skill in the art will recognize means other than high melting point components (as discussed below) can be used to provide comparable viscosities measured for such compositions comprising such means can be measured by extrapolating a plot of viscosity vs. shear rate for such compositions to a shear rate of zero at a temperature of about 20&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">Preferred compositions are at least semi-solid at room temperature to minimize composition migration. In addition, the compositions preferably have a final melting point (100% liquid) above potential &#x201c;stressful&#x201d; storage conditions that can be greater than 45&#xb0; C.

<p id="p-0045" num="0050">By being solid or semisolid at ambient temperatures, preferred compositions do not have a tendency to flow and migrate to a significant degree to undesired locations of the article to which they are applied. This means less skin care composition is required for imparting desirable therapeutic, protective and/or conditioning benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">To enhance immobility of preferred compositions, the viscosity of the formulated compositions should be as high as possible to prevent flow within the article to undesired location. Unfortunately, in some instances, higher viscosities may inhibit transfer of composition to the wearer's skin. Therefore, a balance should be achieved so the viscosities are high enough to keep the compositions localized on the surface of the article, but not so high as to impede transfer to the wearer's skin. Suitable viscosities for the compositions will typically range from about 5 to about 500 centipoise, preferably from about 5 to about 300 centipoise, more preferably from about 5 to about 100 centipoise, measured at 60&#xb0; C. using a rotational viscometer (a suitable viscometer is available from Lab Line Instruments, Inc. of Melrose Park, Ill. as Model 4537). The viscometer is operated at 60 rpm using a number 2 spindle.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">For compositions designed to provide a therapeutic and/or skin protective benefit, a useful active ingredient in these compositions is one or more skin protectants or emollients. As used herein, the term &#x201c;emollient&#x201d; is a material that protects against wetness or irritation, softens, soothes, supples, coats, lubricates, moisturizes, protects and/or cleanses the skin. (It will be recognized that several of the monographed actives listed above are &#x201c;emollients&#x201d;, as that term is used herein.) In a preferred embodiment, these emollients will have either a plastic or liquid consistency at ambient temperatures, i.e., 20&#xb0; C. Representative emollients useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, emollients that are petroleum-based; sucrose ester fatty acids; polyethylene glycol and derivatives thereof; humectants; fatty acid ester type; alkyl ethoxylate type; fatty acid ester ethoxylates; fatty alcohol type; polysiloxane type; propylene glycol and derivatives thereof; glycerine and derivatives thereof, including glyceride, acetoglycerides, and ethoxylated glycerides of C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>28 </sub>fatty acids; triethylene glycol and derivatives thereof; spermaceti or other waxes; fatty acids; fatty alcohol ethers, particularly those having from 12 to 28 carbon atoms in their fatty chain, such as stearic acid; propoxylated fatty alcohols; other fatty esters of polyhydroxy alcohols; lanolin and its derivatives; kaolin and its derivatives; any of the monographed skin care agents listed above; or mixtures of these emollients. Suitable petroleum-based emollients include those hydrocarbons, or mixtures of hydrocarbons, having chain lengths of from 16 to 32 carbon atoms. Petroleum based hydrocarbons having these chain lengths include mineral oil (also known as &#x201c;liquid petrolatum&#x201d;) and petrolatum (also known as &#x201c;mineral wax,&#x201d; &#x201c;petroleum jelly&#x201d; and &#x201c;mineral jelly&#x201d;). Mineral oil usually refers to less viscous mixtures of hydrocarbons having from 16 to 20 carbon atoms. Petrolatum usually refers to more viscous mixtures of hydrocarbons having from 16 to 32 carbon atoms. Petrolatum and mineral oil are particularly preferred emollients for compositions of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">Suitable fatty acid ester type emollients include those derived from C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>28 </sub>fatty acids, preferably C<sub>16</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>saturated fatty acids, and short chain (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>8</sub>, preferably C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>) monohydric alcohols. Representative examples of such esters include methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, isopropyl laurate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, ethylhexyl palmitate and mixtures thereof. Suitable fatty acid ester emollients can also be derived from esters of longer chain fatty alcohols (C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>28</sub>, preferably C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>16</sub>) and shorter chain fatty acids e.g., lactic acid, such as lauryl lactate and cetyl lactate.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">Suitable alkyl ethoxylate type emollients include C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>fatty alcohol ethoxylates having an average degree of ethoxylation of from about 2 to about 30. Preferably, the fatty alcohol ethoxylate emollient is selected from the group consisting of lauryl, cetyl, and stearyl ethoxylates, and mixtures thereof, having an average degree of ethoxylation ranging from about 2 to about 23. Representative examples of such alkyl ethoxylates include laureth-3 (a lauryl ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 3), laureth-23 (a lauryl ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 23), ceteth-10 (a cetyl alcohol ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 10) and steareth-10 (a stearyl alcohol ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 10). When employed, these alkyl ethoxylate emollients are typically used in combination with the petroleum-based emollients, such as petrolatum, at a weight ratio of alkyl ethoxylate emollient to petroleum-based emollient of from about 1:1 to about 1:5, preferably from about 1:2 to about 1:4.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">Suitable fatty alcohol type emollients include C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>fatty alcohols, preferably C<sub>16</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>fatty alcohols. Representative examples include cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. When employed, these fatty alcohol emollients are typically used in combination with the petroleum-based emollients, such as petrolatum, at a weight ratio of fatty alcohol emollient to petroleum-based emollient of from about 1:1 to about 1:5, preferably from about 1:1 to about 1:2.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">Other suitable types of emollients for use herein include polysiloxane compounds. In general, suitable polysiloxane materials for use in the present invention include those having monomeric siloxane units of the following structure:</p>

</chemistry>
<br/>
wherein, R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2</sup>, for each independent siloxane monomeric unit can each independently be hydrogen or any alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkaryl, arakyl, cycloalkyl, halogenated hydrocarbon, or other radical. Any of such radicals can be substituted or unsubstituted. R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>radicals of any particular monomeric unit may differ from the corresponding functionalities of the next adjoining monomeric unit. Additionally, the polysiloxane can be either a straight chain, a branched chain or have a cyclic structure. The radicals R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>can additionally independently be other silaceous functionalities such as, but not limited to siloxanes, polysiloxanes, silanes, and polysilanes. The radicals R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>may contain any of a variety of organic functionalities including, for example, alcohol, carboxylic acid, phenyl, and amine functionalities.
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">Exemplary alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, octadecyl, and the like. Exemplary alkenyl radicals are vinyl, allyl, and the like. Exemplary aryl radicals are phenyl, diphenyl, naphthyl, and the like. Exemplary alkaryl radicals are toyl, xylyl, ethylphenyl, and the like. Exemplary aralkyl radicals are benzyl, alpha-phenylethyl, beta-phenylethyl, alpha-phenylbutyl, and the like. Exemplary cycloalkyl radicals are cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and the like. Exemplary halogenated hydrocarbon radicals are chloromethyl, bromoethyl, tetrafluorethyl, fluorethyl, trifluorethyl, trifluorotloyl, hexafluoroxylyl, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">Viscosity of polysiloxanes useful may vary as widely as the viscosity of polysiloxanes in general vary, so long as the polysiloxane is flowable or can be made to be flowable for application to the absorbent article. This includes, but is not limited to, viscosity as low as 5 centistokes (at 37&#xb0; C. as measured by a glass viscometer) to about 20,000,000 centistokes. Preferably the polysiloxanes have a viscosity at 37&#xb0; C. ranging from about 5 to about 5,000 centistokes, more preferably from about 5 to about 2,000 centistokes, most preferably from about 100 to about 1000 centistokes. High viscosity polysiloxanes which themselves are resistant to flowing can be effectively deposited upon the absorbent articles by such methods as, for example, emulsifying the polysiloxane in surfactant or providing the polysiloxane in solution with the aid of a solvent, such as hexane, listed for exemplary purposes only. Particular methods for applying polysiloxane emollients to absorbent articles are discussed in more detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0060">Preferred polysiloxanes compounds for use in the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,282 (Ampulski et al), issued Oct. 22, 1991, which is incorporated herein by reference. Particularly preferred polysiloxane compounds for use as emollients in the compositions of the present invention include phenyl-functional polymethylsiloxane compounds (e.g., Dow Corning 556 Cosmetic-Grade Fluid: polyphenylmethylsiloxane) and cetyl or stearyl functionalized dimethicones such as Dow 2502 and Dow 2503 polysiloxane liquids, respectively. In addition to such substitution with phenyl-functional or alkyl groups, effective substitution may be made with amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, polyether, aldehyde, ketone, amide, ester, and thiol groups. Of these effective substituent groups, the family of groups comprising phenyl, amino, alkyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups are more preferred than the others; and phenyl-functional groups are most preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0061">Suitable humectants include glycerine, propylene glycol, sorbitol, trihydroxy stearin, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0062">When present, the amount of emollient that can be included in the composition will depend on a variety of factors, including the particular emollient involved, the skin benefits desired, the other components in the composition and like factors. The composition will comprise from 0 to about 100%, by total weight, of the emollient. Preferably, the composition will comprise from about 10 to about 95%, more preferably from about 20 to about 80%, and most preferably from about 40 to about 75%, by weight, of the emollient.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0063">Another optional, preferred component of the therapeutic/skin protective compositions useful in the methods of the present invention is an agent capable of immobilizing the composition (including the preferred emollient and/or other skin condition/protective agents) in the desired location in or on the treated article. Because certain of the preferred emollients in the composition have a plastic or liquid consistency at 20&#xb0; C., they tend to flow or migrate, even when subjected to modest shear. When applied to a wearer-contacting surface or other location of an absorbent article, especially in a melted or molten state, the emollient will not remain primarily in or on the treated region. Instead, the emollient will tend to migrate and flow to undesired regions of the article.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0064">Specifically, if the emollient migrates into the interior of the article, it can cause undesired effects on the absorbency of the article core due to the hydrophobic characteristics of many of the emollients and other skin conditioning agents used in the compositions useful in the methods of the present invention. It also means that much more emollient has to be applied to the article to get the desired therapeutic and/or protective benefits. Increasing the level of emollient not only increases the cost, but also exacerbates the undesirable effect on the absorbency of the article's core and undesired transfer of composition during processing/converting of the treated articles.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">The immobilizing agent counteracts this tendency of the emollient to migrate or flow by keeping the emollient primarily localized on the surface or in the region of the article to which the composition is applied. This is believed to be due, in part, to the fact that the immobilizing agent raises the melting point and/or viscosity of the composition above that of the emollient. Since the immobilizing agent is preferably miscible with the emollient (or solubilized in the emollient with the aid of an appropriate emulsifier), it entraps the emollient on the surface of the article's wearer contacting surface or in the region to which it is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066">The immobilizing agent counteracts this tendency of the emollient to migrate or flow by keeping the emollient primarily localized on the surface or in the region of the article to which the composition is applied. This is believed to be due, in part, to the fact that the immobilizing agent raises the melting point and/or viscosity of the composition above that of the emollient. Since the immobilizing agent is preferably miscible with the emollient (or solubilized in the emollient with the aid of an appropriate emulsifier or dispersed therein), it entraps the emollient on the surface of the article's wearer contacting surface or in the region to which it is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067">It is also advantageous to &#x201c;lock&#x201d; the immobilizing agent on the wearer contacting surface or the region of the article to which it is applied. This can be accomplished by using immobilizing agents which quickly set up (i.e., solidify) upon application to the article. In addition, outside cooling of the treated article via blowers, fans, cold rolls, etc. can speed up crystallization of the immobilizing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0068">In addition to being miscible with (or solubilized in) the emollient, the immobilizing agent will preferably have a melting profile that will provide a composition that is solid or semisolid at ambient temperature. In this regard, preferred immobilizing agents will have a melting point of at least about 35&#xb0; C. This is so the immobilizing agent itself will not have a tendency to migrate or flow. Preferred immobilizing agents will have melting points of at least about 40&#xb0; C. Typically, the immobilizing agent will have a melting point in the range of from about 50&#xb0; to about 150&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0069">When utilized, immobilizing agents useful herein can be selected from any of a number of agents, so long as the preferred properties of the skin care composition provide the skin benefits described herein. Preferred immobilizing agents will comprise a member selected from the group consisting of C<sub>14</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>fatty alcohols, C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>fatty acids, and C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>fatty alcohol ethoxylates having an average degree of ethoxylation ranging from 2 to about 30, and mixtures thereof. Preferred immobilizing agents include C<sub>16</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>fatty alcohols, most preferably crystalline high melting materials selected from the group consisting of cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof (The linear structure of these materials can speed up solidification on the treated absorbent article.) Mixtures of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol are particularly preferred. Other preferred immobilizing agents include C<sub>16</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>fatty acids, most preferably selected from the group consisting of palmitic acid, stearic acid, and mixtures thereof. Mixtures of palmitic acid and stearic acid are particularly preferred. Still other preferred immobilizing agents include C<sub>16</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>fatty alcohol ethoxylates having an average degree of ethoxylation ranging from about 5 to about 20. Preferably, the fatty alcohols, fatty acids and fatty alcohols are linear. Importantly, these preferred immobilizing agents such as the C<sub>16</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>fatty alcohols increase the rate of crystallization of the composition causing the composition to crystallize rapidly onto the surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">Other types of immobilizing agents that may be used herein include polyhydroxy fatty acid esters, polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, and mixtures thereof. Preferred esters and amides will have three or more free hydroxy groups on the polyhydroxy moiety and are typically nonionic in character. Because of the possible skin sensitivity of those using articles to which the composition is applied, these esters and amides should also be relatively mild and non-irritating to the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0071">Suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention will have the formula:</p>

Suitable Y groups can be derived from polyols such as glycerol, pentaerythritol; sugars such as raffinose, maltodextrose, galactose, sucrose, glucose, xylose, fructose, maltose, lactose, mannose and erythrose; sugar alcohols such as erythritol, xylitol, malitol, mannitol and sorbitol; and anhydrides of sugar alcohols such as sorbitan.
</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0073">One class of suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention comprises certain sorbitan esters, preferably the sorbitan esters of C<sub>16</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>saturated fatty acids. Because of the manner in which they are typically manufactured, these sorbitan esters usually comprise mixtures of mono-, di-, tri-, etc. esters. Representative examples of suitable sorbitan esters include sorbitan palmitates (e.g., SPAN 40), sorbitan stearates (e.g., SPAN 60), and sorbitan behenates, that comprise one or more of the mono-, di- and tri-ester versions of these sorbitan esters, e.g., sorbitan mono-, di- and tri-palmitate, sorbitan mono-, di- and tri-stearate, sorbitan mono-, di and tri-behenate, as well as mixed tallow fatty acid sorbitan mono-, di- and tri-esters. Mixtures of different sorbitan esters can also be used, such as sorbitan palmitates with sorbitan stearates. Particularly preferred sorbitan esters are the sorbitan stearates, typically as a mixture of mono-, di- and tri-esters (plus some tetraester) such as SPAN 60, and sorbitan stearates sold under the trade name GLYCOMUL-S by Lonza, Inc. Although these sorbitan esters typically contain mixtures of mono-, di- and tri-esters, plus some tetraester, the mono- and di-esters are usually the predominant species in these mixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0074">Another class of suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention comprises certain glyceryl monoesters, preferably glyceryl monoesters of C<sub>16</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>saturated fatty acids such as glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl monopalmitate, and glyceryl monobehenate. Again, like the sorbitan esters, glyceryl monoester mixtures will typically contain some di- and triester. However, such mixtures should contain predominantly the glyceryl monoester species to be useful in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0075">Another class of suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention comprise certain sucrose fatty acid esters, preferably the C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>saturated fatty acid esters of sucrose.

<p id="p-0073" num="0078">The Z moiety preferably will be derived from a reducing sugar in a reductive amination reaction; most preferably glycityl. Suitable reducing sugars include glucose, fructose, maltose, lactose, galactose, mannose, and xylose.

wherein R<sup>1 </sup>is methyl or methoxypropyl; R<sup>2 </sup>is a C<sub>11</sub>-C<sub>17 </sub>straight-chain alkyl or alkenyl group. These include N-lauryl-N-methyl glucamide, N-lauryl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide, N-cocoyl-N-methyl glucamide, N-cocoyl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide, N-palmityl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide, N-tallowyl-N-methyl glucamide, or N-tallowyl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide.
</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0083">As previously noted, some of the immobilizing agents may require an emulsifier for solubilization in the emollient. This is particularly the case for certain of the glucamides such as the N-alkyl-N-methoxypropyl glucamides having HLB values of at least about 7. Suitable emulsifiers will typically include those having HLB values below about 7. In this regard, the sorbitan esters previously described, such as the sorbitan stearates, having HLB values of about 4.9 or less have been found useful in solubilizing these glucamide immobilizing agents in petrolatum. Other suitable emulsifiers include steareth-2 (polyethylene glycol ethers of stearyl alcohol that conform to the formula CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>17</sub>(OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>OH, where n has an average value of 2), sorbitan tristearate, isosorbide laurate, and glyceryl monostearate. The emulsifier can be included in an amount sufficient to solubilize the immobilizing agent in the emollient such that a substantially homogeneous mixture is obtained. For example, an approximately 1:1 mixture of N-cocoyl-N-methyl glucamide and petrolatum that will normally not melt into a single phase mixture, will melt into a single phase mixture upon the addition of 20% of a 1:1 mixture of Steareth-2 and sorbitan tristearate as the emulsifier.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0084">Other types of ingredients that can be used as immobilizing agents, either alone, or in combination with the above-mentioned immobilizing agents, include waxes such as carnauba, ozokerite, beeswax, candelilla, paraffin, ceresin, esparto, ouricuri, rezowax, isoparaffin, and other known mined and mineral waxes. The high melt point of these materials can help immobilize the composition on the desired surface or location on the article. Addionally microcrystalline waxes are effective immobilizing agents. Microcrystalline waxes can aid in &#x201c;locking&#x201d; up low molecular weight hydrocarbons within the skin care composition. Preferably the wax is a paraffin wax. An example of a particularly preferred alternate immobilizing agent is a paraffin wax such as Parrafin S.P. 434 from Strahl and Pitsch Inc. P.O. Box 1098 West Babylon, N.Y. 11704.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0085">The amount of the optional immobilizing agent that can be included in the composition will depend on a variety of factors, including the actives (e.g., emollients) involved, the particular immobilizing agent involved, if any, the other components in the composition, whether an emulsifier is required to solubilize the immobilizing agent in the other components, and like factors. When present, the composition will typically comprise from about 5 to about 90% of the immobilizing agent. Preferably, the composition will comprise from about 5 to about 50%, most preferably from about 10 to about 40%, of the immobilizing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0086">Of course, it is highly desirable that at least a portion of the article's topsheet be made of a hydrophilic material to promote rapid transfer of liquids (e.g., urine) through the topsheet. Similarly, it may be desirable that the composition be sufficiently wettable to ensure that liquids will transfer through the topsheet rapidly. Alternatively, hydrophobic skin care composition may be utilized, so long as they are applied such that the fluid handling properties of the topsheet are adequately maintained. (For example, as discussed below, nonuniform application of the composition to the topsheet is one means to accomplish this goal.) This diminishes the likelihood that body exudates will flow off the composition-treated topsheet rather than being drawn through the topsheet and being absorbed by the absorbent core. Where a hydrophilic composition is desired, depending upon the particular components used in the composition, a hydrophilic surfactant (or a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants) may, or may not, be required to improve wettability. For example, some immobilizing agents, such as N-cocoyl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide have HLB values of at least about 7 and are sufficiently wettable without the addition of hydrophilic surfactant. Other immobilizing agents such as the C<sub>16</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>fatty alcohols having HLB values below about 7 may require addition of hydrophilic surfactant to improve wettability when the composition is applied to article topsheets. Similarly, a hydrophobic emollient such as petrolatum may require the addition of a hydrophilic surfactant if hydrophilic composition is desired. Of course, the concern around wettability is not a factor when the wearer-contacting surface under consideration is other than the article's topsheet or when fluid handling properties of the topsheet are adequately maintained via other means (e.g., nonuniform application).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0087">Suitable hydrophilic surfactants will preferably be miscible with the other components of the skin care composition so as to form blended mixtures. Because of possible skin sensitivity of those using disposable absorbent products to which the composition is applied, these surfactants should also be relatively mild and non-irritating to the skin. Typically, these hydrophilic surfactants are nonionic to be not only non-irritating to the skin, but also to avoid other undesirable effects on any other structures within the treated article. For example, reductions tissue laminate tensile strength, adhesive bond sufficiencies, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0088">Suitable nonionic surfactants may be substantially nonmigratory after the composition is applied to the articles and will typically have HLB values in the range of from about 4 to about 20, preferably from about 7 to about 20. To be nonmigratory, these nonionic surfactants will typically have melt temperatures greater than the temperatures commonly encountered during storage, shipping, merchandising, and use of disposable absorbent products, e.g., at least about 30&#xb0; C. In this regard, these nonionic surfactants will preferably have melting points similar to those of the immobilizing agents previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0089">Suitable nonionic surfactants for use in compositions that will be applied to the articles, at least in the liquid discharge region of the diaper, include alkylglycosides; alkylglycoside ethers as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,011,389 (Langdon, et al), issued Mar. 8, 1977, which is incorporated by reference; alkylpolyethoxylated esters such as Pegosperse 1000 MS (available from Lonza, Inc., Fair Lawn, N.J.), ethoxylated sorbitan mono-, di- and/or tri-esters of C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>fatty acids having an average degree of ethoxylation of from about 2 to about 20, preferably from about 2 to about 10, such as TWEEN 60 (sorbitan esters of stearic acid having an average degree of ethoxylation of about 20) and TWEEN 61 (sorbitan esters of stearic acid having an average degree of ethoxylation of about 4), and the condensation products of aliphatic alcohols with from about 1 to about 54 moles of ethylene oxide. The alkyl chain of the aliphatic alcohol is typically in a straight chain (linear) configuration and contains from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred are the condensation products of alcohols having an alkyl group containing from about 11 to about 22 carbon atoms with from about 2 to about 30 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Examples of such ethoxylated alcohols include the condensation products of myristyl alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, the condensation products of coconut alcohol (a mixture of fatty alcohols having alkyl chains varying in length from 10 to 14 carbon atoms) with about 6 moles of ethylene oxide. A number of suitable ethoxylated alcohols are commercially available, including TERGITOL 15-S-9 (the condensation product of C<sub>11</sub>-C<sub>15 </sub>linear alcohols with 9 moles of ethylene oxide), marketed by Union Carbide Corporation; KYRO EOB (condensation product of C<sub>13</sub>-C<sub>15 </sub>linear alcohols with 9 moles of ethylene oxide), marketed by The Procter &#x26; Gamble Co., the NEODOL brand name surfactants marketed by Shell Chemical Co., in particular NEODOL 25-12 (condensation product of C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>15 </sub>linear alcohols with 12 moles of ethylene oxide) and NEODOL 23-6.5T (condensation product of C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>13 </sub>linear alcohols with 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide that has been distilled (topped) to remove certain impurities), and especially the PLURAFAC brand name surfactants marketed by BASF Corp., in particular PLURAFAC A-38 (a condensation product of a C<sub>18 </sub>straight chain alcohol with 27 moles of ethylene oxide). (Certain of the hydrophilic surfactants, in particular ethoxylated alcohols such as NEODOL 25-12, can also function as alkyl ethoxylate emollients). Other examples of preferred ethoxylated alcohol surfactants include ICI's class of Brij surfactants and mixtures thereof, with Brij 72 (i.e., Steareth-2) and Brij 76 (i.e., Steareth-10) being especially preferred. Also, mixtures of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol ethoxylated to an average degree of ethoxylation of from about 10 to about 20 may also be used as the hydrophilic surfactant.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0090">Another type of suitable surfactant for use in the composition includes Aerosol OT, a dioctyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid marketed by American Cyanamid Company.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0091">Still another type of suitable surfactant for use in the composition includes silicone copolymers such as General Electric SF 1188 (a copolymer of a polydimethylsiloxane and a polyoxyalkylene ether) and General Electric SF 1228 (a silicone polyether copolymer). These silicone surfactants can be used in combination with the other types of hydrophilic surfactants discussed above, such as the ethoxylated alcohols. These silicone surfactants have been found to be effective at concentrations as low as 0.1%, more preferably from about 0.25 to about 1.0%, by weight of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0092">Where a hydrophilic composition is desired, the amount of hydrophilic surfactant required to increase the wettability of the composition to a desired level will depend in-part upon the HLB value and level of immobilizing agent, if any, used, the HLB value of the surfactant used and like factors. The composition can comprise from about 0.1 to about 50% of the hydrophilic surfactant when needed to increase the wettability properties of the composition. Preferably, the composition comprises from about 1 to about 25%, most preferably from about 10 to about 20%, of the hydrophilic surfactant when needed to increase wettability.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0093">Compositions can comprise other components typically present in emulsions, creams, ointment, lotions, powders, suspensions, etc. of this type. These components include water, viscosity modifiers, perfumes, disinfectant antibacterial actives, antiviral agents, vitamins, pharmaceutical actives, film formers, deodorants, opacifiers, astringents, solvents, preservatives, and the like. In addition, stabilizers can be added to enhance the shelf life of the composition such as cellulose derivatives, proteins and lecithin. All of these materials are well known in the art as additives for such formulations and can be employed in appropriate amounts in the compositions for use herein.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0094">If water-based skin care compositions are used, a preservative will be needed. Suitable preservatives include propyl paraben, methyl paraben, benzyl alcohol, benzylkonnium, tribasic calcium phosphate, BHT, or acids such as citric, tartaric, maleic, lactic, malic, benzoic, salicylic, and the like. Suitable viscosity increasing agents include some of the agents described as effective immobilizing agents. Other suitable viscosity increasing agents include alkyl galactomannan, silica, talc, magnesium silicate, sorbitol, colloidal silicone dioxide, magnesium aluminum silicate, zinc stearate, wool wax alcohol, sorbiton, sesquioleate, cetyl hydroxy ethyl cellulose and other modified celluloses. Suitable solvents include propylene glycol, glycerine, cyclomethicone, polyethylene glycols, hexylene glycol, diol and multi-hydroxy based solvents. Suitable vitamins include A, D-3, E, B-5 and E acetate.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">IV. Absorbent Articles</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0095">As used herein, the term &#x201c;absorbent article&#x201d; refers to a device which absorbs and retains body exudates. The term &#x201c;disposable&#x201d; is used herein to describe absorbent articles which are not intended to be laundered or otherwise restored or reused as an absorbent article after a single use. Examples of disposable absorbent articles include feminine hygiene garments such as sanitary napkins, panti-liners and tampons, diapers, incontinence briefs, diaper holders, training pants, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0096">Disposable absorbent articles typically comprise a liquid pervious topsheet, a liquid impervious backsheet and an absorbent core positioned between the topsheet and the backsheet. Disposable absorbent articles and components thereof, including the topsheet, backsheet, absorbent core, and any individual layers of these components, have a body facing surface and a garment facing surface. As used herein, &#x201c;body facing surface&#x201d; means that surface of the article or component which is intended to be worn toward or adjacent to the body of the wearer, while the &#x201c;garment facing surface&#x201d; is on the opposite side and is intended to be worn toward or placed adjacent to the wearer's clothing or undergarments when the disposable absorbent article is worn.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0097">The following description generally discusses the absorbent core, topsheet, and backsheet materials that are useful in disposable absorbent articles that are used in the methods of the present invention. It is to be understood that this general description applies to these components of the specific absorbent articles shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and further described below, in addition to those of other disposable absorbent articles which are generally described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0098">In general, the absorbent core is capable of absorbing or retaining liquids (e.g., menses, urine, and/or other body exudates). The absorbent core is preferably compressible, conformable, and non-irritating to the wearer's skin. The absorbent core may be manufactured in a wide variety of sizes and shapes (e.g., rectangular, oval, hourglass, &#x201c;T&#x201d; shaped, dog bone, asymmetric, etc.). In addition to the absorbent composites of the present invention, the absorbent core may include any of a wide variety of liquid-absorbent materials commonly used in absorbent articles, such as comminuted wood pulp, which is generally referred to as airfelt. Examples of other suitable absorbent materials for use in the absorbent core include creped cellulose wadding; meltblown polymers including conform; chemically stiffened, modified or cross-linked cellulosic fibers; synthetic fibers such as crimped polyester fibers; peat moss; tissue including tissue wraps and tissue laminates; absorbent foams; absorbent sponges; superabsorbent polymers; absorbent gelling materials; or any equivalent material or combinations of materials, or mixtures of these.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0099">The configuration and construction of the absorbent core may also be varied (e.g., the absorbent core may have varying caliper zones and/or have a profile so as to be thicker in the center; hydrophilic gradients; gradients of the absorbent composite of the present invention, superabsorbent gradients; or lower average density and lower average basis weight zones, e.g., acquisition zones; or may comprise one or more layers or structures). The total absorbent capacity of the absorbent core should, however, be compatible with the design loading and the intended use of the absorbent article. Further, the size and absorbent capacity of the absorbent core may be varied to accommodate different uses such as diapers, incontinence pads, pantiliners, regular sanitary napkins, and overnight sanitary napkins, and to accommodate wearers ranging from infants to adults.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0100">The absorbent core can include other absorbent components that are often used in absorbent articles, for example, a dusting layer, a wicking or acquisition layer, or a secondary topsheet for increasing the wearer's comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0101">The topsheet is preferably compliant, soft feeling, and non-irritating to the wearer's skin. Further, the topsheet is liquid pervious, permitting liquids (e.g., menses and/or urine) to readily penetrate through its thickness. A suitable topsheet may be manufactured from a wide range of materials such as woven and nonwoven materials (e.g., a nonwoven web of fibers), including apertured nonwovens; polymeric materials such as apertured formed thermoplastic films, apertured plastic films, and hydroformed thermoplastic films; porous foams; reticulated foams; reticulated thermoplastic films; and thermoplastic scrims. Suitable woven and nonwoven materials can be comprised of natural fibers (e.g., wood or cotton fibers), synthetic fibers (e.g., polymeric fibers such as polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene fibers) or from a combination of natural and synthetic fibers. When the topsheet comprises a nonwoven web, the web may be manufactured by a wide number of known techniques. For example, the web may be spunbonded, spunlace carded, wet-laid, melt-blown, hydroentangled, hydroformed, hydroapertured, combinations of the above, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0102">The backsheet is impervious to liquids (e.g., menses and/or urine) and is preferably comprises a thin plastic film, although other flexible liquid impervious materials may also be used. As used herein, the term &#x201c;flexible&#x201d; refers to materials which are compliant and will readily conform to the general shape and contours of the human body. The backsheet prevents the exudates absorbed and contained in the absorbent core from wetting articles which contact the absorbent article such as bedsheets, pants, pajamas and undergarments. The backsheet may thus comprise a woven or nonwoven material, polymeric films such as thermoplastic films of polyethylene or polypropylene, or composite materials such as a film-coated nonwoven material.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0103">The backing materials or outer covers of diapers have traditionally been made from plastic films due to cost considerations and the liquid impermeable nature of plastic films. While plastic films are efficient at containing liquids and other waste matters during use, the same plastic films have certain disadvantages in that they are not pleasing to the touch and they do not readily pass water vapor so that, from a wearer wellness standpoint, plastic films tend to cause skin hydration thereby making infants more prone to diaper rash. One solution has been to supplant normal nonporous plastic films with breathable plastic films as the diaper backing materials. For the purposes of the present invention, a film is &#x201c;breathable&#x201d; if it has a water vapor transmission rate of at least 100 g/m<sup>2</sup>/24 hours as calculated using the test method outlined below with respect to the examples. Polyolefin films are often used for making breathable films. A particularly useful film for such application is made from a linear polyolefin containing organic and/or inorganic fillers. Such filled polyolefin films provide good water vapor transmission thereby making the diapers more comfortable to the wearer. As a result, the relative humidity and temperature within the diaper or other product can be reduced by using breathable materials. Despite this, such breathable films have the disadvantage of being cold and clammy because breathable films pass moisture to the outside of the product where it condenses readily on the film surface. Consequently, another solution has been to attempt to use nonwoven materials as the backing material for diapers. Fibrous nonwoven webs when used as the backing material for diapers alleviate the above-mentioned film problems, however, such fibrous nonwoven webs generally provide poor barriers to the passage of liquids including urine. In view of the foregoing deficiencies of both films and fibrous nonwovens, attempts have been made to combine the two materials thereby making it possible to rely upon the strengths of one material to overcome the weaknesses of the other.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0104">A suitable backsheet is a polyethylene film having a thickness of from about 0.012 mm (0.5 mil) to about 0.051 mm (2.0 mils). Exemplary polyethylene films are manufactured by Clopay Corporation of Cincinnati, Ohio, under the designation P18-1401 and by Tredegar Film Products of Terre Haute, Ind., under the designation XP-39385. The backsheet is preferably embossed and/or matte finished to provide a more clothlike appearance. The size of the backsheet is dictated by the size of the absorbent core and the exact absorbent article design selected.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0105">As discussed above, while it is preferred that the composition which is continually, automatically transferred to the wearer's skin by wearing articles described herein be relatively impervious to liquids such as urine and runny feces, it is also preferred that the composition be relatively vapor pervious to provide a nonocclusive barrier for the skin. In this regard, to further facilitate the maintenance or improvement of skin health, uncompromised skin in the wearer's region under the absorbent article via the presently disclosed methods, preferred absorbent articles useful in those methods are those which also provide &#x201c;breathability&#x201d;, to facilitate relatively lower relative humidity in the area between the skin and the absorbent article. Recently, attempts have been disclosed that are directed to improving wearer skin condition by allowing the overhydrated skin to dehydrate to an acceptable level by allowing either air to reach the skin (thus minimizing potential occlusion effects) and/or providing means for removing water vapor from the surface of the skin. Generally, such mechanisms are referred to as &#x201c;breathability&#x201d; or &#x201c;vapor or moisture permeability&#x201d;. Specific examples include feminine hygiene products, such as catamenial products or so-called pantiliners as described in EP-A-0.104.906; EP-A-0.171.041; EP-A-0.710.471; the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such products generally have relatively low liquid storage capacity when compared, for example, to baby diapers or adult incontinence products, which have theoretical storage capacities more than ten times the capacity of a feminine hygiene product. The &#x201c;breathable&#x201d; articles described in these references may be treated with skin care composition as described herein, and such treated articles may be useful in the methods of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0106">Such breathable materials can be various kinds of webs, such as films which are rendered air/vapor pervious by aperturing as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,628,737, which issued in the name of Dobrin, et al. on May 13, 1997, or by exploiting the &#x201c;microporosity&#x201d; property as described in EP-A-0.238.200; EP-A-0.288.021; EP-A-0.352.802; EP-A-0.515.501; U.S. Pat. No. 4,713,068, whereby small voids are created within the film similar to very small cracks. WO 94/23107; WO 94/28224; U.S. Pat. No. 4,758,339 which issued in the name of Yeo, et al. on Jul. 19, 1988; and EP-A-0.315.013 all describe alternative breathable materials which can be fibrous textile or non-woven webs, with air/vapor easily penetrating through the relatively large pores of the structure. Such webs, being either treated or untreated with regard to improving their liquid impermeability properties, such as described in EP-A-0.196.654. In WO 95/16562 a laminate of a non-woven with a breathable film is disclosed. Further disclosures such as in WO 95/16746 relate to other materials allowing water molecules to diffuse through. Also, combinations of various materials comprising various layers of any of the above elements are also well known. Absorbent articles using any of the approaches described in these references (each of which is incorporated herein by reference) in combination with delivering a composition as described herein may be used to carry out the methods of the present invention. Indeed, a particularly preferred absorbent article for use in the present methods is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,537, issued to Elder et al. on Aug. 22, 2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0107">The backsheet and the topsheet are positioned adjacent the garment facing surface and the body facing surface, respectively, of the absorbent core. The absorbent core is preferably joined with the topsheet, the backsheet, or both in any manner as is known by attachment means (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) such as those well known in the art. However, embodiments of the present invention are envisioned wherein portions or the entire absorbent core are unattached to either the topsheet, the backsheet, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0108">For example, the backsheet and/or the topsheet may be secured to the absorbent core or to each other by a uniform continuous layer of adhesive, a patterned layer of adhesive, or an array of separate lines, spirals, or spots of adhesive. Adhesives which have been found to be satisfactory are manufactured by H. B. Fuller Company of St. Paul, Minn. under the designation HL-1258 or H-2031. The attachment means will preferably comprise an open pattern network of filaments of adhesive as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,573,986, issued to Minetola, et al. on Mar. 4, 1986, and which is incorporated herein by reference. An exemplary attachment means of an open pattern network of filaments comprises several lines of adhesive filaments swirled into a spiral pattern such as illustrated by the apparatus and method shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,911,173 issued to Sprague, Jr. on Oct. 7, 1975; U.S. Pat. No. 4,785,996 issued to Zwieker, et al. on Nov. 22, 1978; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,666 issued to Werenicz on Jun. 27, 1989. Each of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the attachment means may comprise heat bonds, pressure bonds, ultrasonic bonds, dynamic mechanical bonds, or any other suitable attachment means or combinations of these attachment means as are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0109">A preferred disposable absorbent article in which the wearer contacting surface is treated with a composition are diapers. As used herein, the term &#x201c;diaper&#x201d; refers to an absorbent article generally worn by infants, and incontinent persons, that is worn about the lower torso of the wearer. In other words, the term &#x201c;diaper&#x201d; includes infant diapers, training pants, adult incontinence devices, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view of the diaper <b>50</b> useful in the methods of the present invention in its flat-out, uncontracted state (i.e., with elastic induced contraction pulled out) with portions of the structure being cut-away to more clearly show the construction of the diaper <b>50</b> and with the portion of the diaper <b>50</b> which faces away from the wearer (the outer surface) oriented towards the viewer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the diaper <b>50</b> preferably comprises a liquid pervious topsheet <b>520</b>; a liquid impervious backsheet <b>530</b> joined with the topsheet <b>520</b>; an absorbent core <b>540</b> positioned between the topsheet <b>520</b> and the backsheet <b>530</b>, the absorbent core <b>540</b> having a garment facing surface <b>542</b>, a body facing surface <b>544</b>, side edges <b>546</b>, waist edges <b>548</b>, and ears <b>549</b>. The diaper <b>50</b> preferably further comprises elasticized leg cuffs <b>550</b>; an elastic waist feature multiply designated as <b>560</b>; and a fastening system generally multiply designated as <b>570</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0111">The diaper <b>50</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to have an outer surface <b>52</b>, an inner surface <b>54</b> corresponding to the body facing surface which is opposed to the outer surface <b>52</b>, a first waist region <b>56</b>, a second waist region <b>58</b>, and a periphery <b>51</b> which is defined by the outer edges of the diaper <b>50</b> in which the longitudinal edges are designated <b>55</b> and the end edges are designated <b>57</b>. (While the skilled artisan will recognize that a diaper is usually described in terms of having a pair of waist regions and a crotch region between the waist regions, in this application, for simplicity of terminology, the diaper <b>50</b> is described as having only waist regions including a portion of the diaper which would typically be designated as part of the crotch region). The body facing surface <b>54</b> of the diaper <b>50</b> comprises that portion of the diaper <b>50</b> which is positioned adjacent to the wearer's body during use. The body facing surface <b>54</b> generally is formed by at least a portion of the topsheet <b>520</b> and other components that may be joined to the topsheet <b>520</b>, such as leg cuffs <b>550</b>, as well as any regions to which the topsheet may not extend but which still contact the wearer, such as the waist feature <b>560</b>, side panels and the like. The outer surface <b>52</b> comprises that portion of the diaper <b>50</b> which is positioned away from the wearer's body (i.e., the outer surface <b>52</b> generally is formed by at least a portion of the backsheet <b>530</b> and other components that may be joined to the backsheet <b>530</b>). The first waist region <b>56</b> and the second waist region <b>58</b> extend, respectively, from the end edges <b>57</b> of the periphery <b>51</b> to the lateral centerline <b>53</b> of the diaper <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows the longitudinal centerline <b>59</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0108" num="0113">Diapers of the present invention can have a number of well known configurations, with the absorbent cores thereof being adapted to the present invention. Exemplary configurations are described generally in U.S. Pat. No. 3,860,003 issued to Buell on Jan. 14, 1975; U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,092 issued to Buell et al. on Sep. 29, 1992; U.S. Pat. No. 5,221,274 issued to Buell et al. on Jun. 22, 1993. Each of these patents is incorporated herein by reference. Another diaper configuration to which the present invention can be readily adapted are described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/203,456; filed on Feb. 28, 1994 and incorporated herein by reference. The absorbent cores of diapers described in these patents can be adapted in light of the teachings herein to include the absorbent composite of the present invention as an absorbent gelling material described therein.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0114">A topsheet <b>520</b> which is particularly suitable for use in the diaper <b>50</b>, is carded and thermally bonded by means well known to those skilled in the fabrics art. A satisfactory topsheet for the present invention comprises staple length polypropylene fibers having a denier of about 2.2 As used herein, the term &#x201c;staple length fibers&#x201d; refers to those fibers having a length of at least about 15.9 mm (0.625 inches). Preferably, the topsheet has a basis weight from about 14 to about 25 grams per square meter. A suitable topsheet is manufactured by Veratec, Inc., a Division of International Paper Company, of Walpole, Mass. under the designation P-8.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0115">The topsheet <b>520</b> of diaper <b>50</b> is preferably made of a hydrophilic material to promote rapid transfer of liquids (e.g., urine) through the topsheet. If the topsheet is made of a hydrophobic material, at least portions of the upper surface of the topsheet are treated to be hydrophilic so that liquids will transfer through the topsheet more rapidly. This diminishes the likelihood that body exudates will flow off the topsheet rather than being drawn through the topsheet and being absorbed by the absorbent core. The topsheet can be rendered hydrophilic by treating it with a surfactant. Suitable methods for treating the topsheet with a surfactant include spraying the topsheet material with the surfactant and immersing the material into the surfactant.

<p id="p-0111" num="0116">Alternatively, the topsheet may be in the form of an apertured formed film, which is preferred in feminine hygiene absorbent articles. Apertured formed films are useful because they are pervious to body liquids and yet non-absorbent and have a reduced tendency to allow liquids to pass back through and rewet the wearer's skin. Thus, the surface of the formed film that is in contact with the body remains dry, thereby reducing body soiling and creating a more comfortable feel for the wearer. Suitable formed films are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,135 (Thompson), issued Dec. 30, 1975; U.S. Pat. No. 4,324,246 (Mullane et al.), issued Apr. 13, 1982; U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0112" num="0117">The body facing surface of the formed film topsheet can be hydrophilic so as to help body liquids to transfer through the topsheet faster than if the body surface was not hydrophilic so as to diminish the likelihood that liquid will flow off the topsheet rather than flowing into and being absorbed by the absorbent structure. In a preferred embodiment, surfactant is incorporated into the polymeric materials of the formed film topsheet such as is described in U.S. patent Application Ser. No. 07/794,745, &#x201c;Absorbent Article Having A Nonwoven and Apertured Film Coversheet&#x201d; filed on Nov. 19, 1991 by Aziz, et al., which is incorporated by reference.

<p id="h-0011" num="0000">V. Treating Articles With Composition</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0131">In preparing absorbent articles to carry out the methods of the present invention, the skin care composition is applied such that during wear, at least some portion of the composition will transfer from the treated article to the wearer's skin. That is, skin care composition is either applied directly to one or more wearer contacting surfaces, or is applied to alternate locations or means such that the skin care composition is readily available for transfer from one or more wearer contacting surfaces during use without intervention by the user/caregiver. (For example, materials positioned beneath the wearer contacting surface, encapsulated compositions, etc.) Of course, to effectuate delivery of composition to those body regions most susceptible to skin disorders, it will be preferred to include the composition on the portion of the topsheet and cuffs that will contact the wearer's buttocks, genitals, intertriginous and anal regions during wear. Additionally, the composition may be applied to other article regions for delivery to one or more of the wearer's hips, abdomen, back, waist, sides, thighs, etc. Any of a variety of application methods that evenly distribute lubricious materials having a molten or liquid consistency can be used. Suitable methods include spraying, printing (e.g., flexographic printing), coating (e.g., contact slot coating, gravure coating), extrusion, or combinations of these application techniques, e.g. spraying the skin care composition on a rotating surface, such as a calender roll, that then transfers the composition to the desired portion of the article. The skin care composition can also be applied as a solid material via any of a variety methods, for example extrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0132">When applied to the article's topsheet, the manner of applying the composition to the article should be such that the topsheet does not become saturated with the composition, at least in the region corresponding to the liquid discharge region of the article, if the composition is hydrophobic in nature. If the topsheet becomes saturated with the composition in the liquid discharge region, there is a greater potential for the composition to block the topsheet openings, reducing the ability of the topsheet to transmit liquid to the underlying absorbent core. Also, saturation of the topsheet is not required to obtain the therapeutic and/or protective benefits. Similarly, saturation of other treated article components may not be necessary or desired to transfer sufficient composition for desired skin benefits. Particularly suitable application methods will apply the composition primarily to the outer surface of the diaper topsheet.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0133">The minimum level of composition to be applied to the article's wearer-contacting surface is an amount effective for providing the therapeutic and/or protective benefits when the composition is delivered pursuant to the present methods. The level of composition applied will depend on various factors, including the article component treated, the relative amount of surface area of the wearer-contacting surface not treated with the composition, the composition's content and the like. In general, with compositions that are relatively hydrophobic and are to be applied to essentially all of the topsheet, the composition is preferably applied to the article topsheet in an amount ranging from about 0.1 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.016 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 15 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(2.33 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), more preferably from about 1 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.16 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 10 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(1.55 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>). It will be recognized that higher levels of skin care composition may be applied to other article components where fluid handling properties are not impacted (e.g., cuffs, waist band, side panels, etc.). It will also be recognized that for compositions that are relatively hydrophilic, higher add-on levels may be used on the topsheet without adversely impacting liquid handling properties to an unacceptable degree. Conversely, higher levels of a hydrophilic composition may be undesired when applied to components (e.g., cuff, waist) other than the topsheet, to avoid wicking of exudates to the edges of the article which may result in leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0134">Because the composition is preferably substantially immobilized on the surface of the region treated, relatively small amounts of composition are needed to impart the desired skin care benefits. Applicants believe that the ability to use low levels to impart the desired skin benefits is due to the fact that pursuant to the methods described herein, composition is continuously, automatically delivered as articles are worn. As indicated, the ability to use relatively low levels of skin care composition, allows the article's topsheet to maintain its liquid transfer properties in the liquid discharge region.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0135">The composition can be applied nonuniformly to the wearer contacting surface of the article. By &#x201c;nonuniform&#x201d; it is meant that the amount, location, pattern of distribution, etc. of the composition can vary over the wearer-contacting surface, and may further vary over specific regions of the article. For example, to maintain the liquid handling performance of the topsheet, it may be desired to apply the composition nonuniformly to the topsheet, particularly if the composition is hydrophobic in nature. In this regard, some portions of the treated surface of the article (and regions thereof) can have greater or lesser amounts of composition, including portions of the surface that do not have any composition on it. When the composition is relatively hydrophobic, in one such preferred embodiment the surface of the topsheet will have regions where no composition is applied, particularly in areas of the topsheet that correspond to the crotch region of the article. As used herein, the crotch region of the article is the rectangle, defined below, that is centered longitudinally and laterally about the article's crotch point. The &#x201c;crotch point&#x201d; is determined by placing the article on a wearer in a standing position and then placing an extensible filament around the legs in a figure eight configuration. The point in the article corresponding to the point of intersection of the filament is deemed to be the crotch point of the article. (It is understood that the crotch point is determined by placing the absorbent article on a wearer in the intended manner and determining where the crossed filament would contact the article.) With regard to incontinence devices (e.g., diapers, adult incontinent articles), the length of the crotch region corresponds to 40% of the absorbent article's total length (i.e., in the y-dimension). With regard sanitary napkins, the length of the crotch region corresponds to 80% of the absorbent article's total length. The width of the crotch region is equivalent to the width of the widest absorbent core component as measured at the crotch point. (As used herein, &#x201c;absorbent core&#x201d; components are those materials involved with acquiring, transporting, distributing and/or storing body liquids. As such, the term absorbent core does not include the topsheet or backsheet of the absorbent article.) By way of illustration, for an incontinent article having a length of 20 in. and a core width at the crotch point of 4 in., the crotch region is the rectangle, centered on the crotch point, having a length of 8 in. and a width of 4 in.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0136">Surprisingly, while the topsheet or other components comprising the composition are treated nonuniformly (e.g., microscopic or macroscopic regions where no composition is applied), during wear of the article, the composition is transferred to the wearer even in regions of the skin corresponding to untreated regions within the topsheet or other components. The amount and uniformity of composition transferred to the skin is believed to depend on several factors, including, for example, application pattern of the skin care composition, contact of the wearer's skin to the treated article surface, friction created during wear time between the wearer's skin and the treated region, warmth generated from wearer to enhance the transfer of the composition, the composition's properties, the materials which constitute the composition, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0137">Where the composition is applied nonuniformly, any pattern may be utilized, including, for example, application of small droplets (obtained via, e.g., spraying) discrete dots (obtained via, e.g., gravure printing), stripes that run in the longitudinal or lateral direction of the article (obtained via contact slot coating), spirals that run in the longitudinal or lateral direction, etc., patterned prints, etc. In those embodiments where the topsheet comprises discrete, untreated regions, the percent open area of the region of the topsheet that corresponds to the crotch region of the article can vary widely. (As referred to herein, the &#x201c;percent open area&#x201d; of the topsheet is determined by (i) measuring the surface area of the topsheet that overlies the crotch region, (ii) measuring the total surface area of the untreated region(s) in this portion of the topsheet and (iii) dividing the measurement in (ii) by the measurement in (i). As used herein, &#x201c;untreated&#x201d; means a region of the topsheet having less than about 0.01 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.0016 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) of the composition. In this regard, the percent open area may be from about 1% to about 99%, from about 5% to about 95%, from about 10% to about 90%, from about 15% to about 85%, from about 20% to about 80%, from about 25% to about 75%, from about 30% to about 70%, or from about 35% to about 65%. The percent open area required to achieve the desired composition effect and the desired liquid handling properties of the topsheet will be dictated largely by the characteristics of the composition (in particular the composition's contents and its relative hydrophobicity/hydrophilicy properties). One skilled in the art will appreciate that the desired percent open area will be readily determined through routine experimentation.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0138">In general, with compositions that are relatively hydrophobic and are to be applied such that regions of the topsheet are not coated with the composition, the composition is preferably applied to the article topsheet in an amount ranging from about 0.05 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.0078 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 35 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(5.43 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), more preferably from about 1 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.16 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 25 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(3.88 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), still more preferably 4 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(0.62 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) to about 20 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(3.1 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>). It will be recognized that for compositions that are relatively hydrophilic, higher add-on levels may be used without adversely impacting liquid handling properties of the topsheet to an unacceptable degree. Of course, for articles having relatively high percent open areas in the crotch, greater add-on levels may be obtainable without adversely affecting liquid handling by the topsheet.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0139">In one preferred embodiment for carrying out the present methods, the topsheet of the articles utilized will comprise stripes of composition that run in the article's longitudinal direction. These longitudinal stripes (or spirals) are separated by longitudinal stripes where little or no composition is applied to the topsheet. In these embodiments, each stripe of composition will typically have a width of from about 0.1 in. to about 0.75 in., more typically from about 0.1 in. to about 0.5 in., and the width of the stripes containing no composition will typically be from about 0.1 in. to about 1 in., more typically from about 0.15 to about 0.5 in. These ranges are applicable to typical infant diaper designs. For larger products such as adult incontinent products, these ranges may be higher.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0140">Skin care composition can also be applied in nonuniform patterns on other article components. In these cases, the open area is calculated by the rectangle defined by the perimeters of the skin care composition.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0141">The composition can be applied to the article at any point during assembly. For example, the composition can be applied to the finished disposable absorbent product before it has been packaged. The composition can also be applied to a given component (e.g., topsheet, cuffs, sides, waste, etc.), at the converting site or by the material supplier, before it is combined with the other raw materials to form a finished disposable absorbent product. Again, the composition can be applied to other zones of the article such that the composition will migrate to one or more wearer contacting surfaces during use.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0142">The composition is typically applied from a melt thereof to the article. Since in a preferred embodiment, the composition melts at significantly above ambient temperatures, it is usually applied as a heated composition to the article. Typically, the composition is heated to a temperature in the range from about 35&#xb0; to about 150&#xb0; C., preferably from 40&#xb0; to about 100&#xb0; C., prior to being applied to the article. Once the melted composition has been applied to the article, it is allowed to cool and solidify. Preferably, the application process is designed to aid in the cooling/set up of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0143">In applying compositions to the articles, contact slot coating, spraying, gravure coating, extrusion coating methods are preferred. One such method involves slot coating of the composition on the article's topsheet after the topsheet is assembled with the other raw materials into a finished product.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">VI. Test Methods</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0144">A. Evaluating Erythema and Rash</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0145">1. Test Summary</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0146">Two different infant diaper products are evaluated to determine if there is a difference in the frequency and/or severity of diaper rash and/or erythema in the diaper area in an average infant population associated with the use of a test product (i.e., comprising a skin care composition on one or more wearer contacting surface) over that associated with the control product (an equivalent product, with the exception that it contains no skin care composition).</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0147">2. Investigational Plan</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0148">2.1 Study Design</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0149">This study is conducted at a qualified clinical research organization (CRO) and should comply with good clinical practices (GCP) guidelines. The study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group comparison clinical trial in which both the trained skin grader conducting skin evaluations and the caregivers of the panelists will be unaware of the treatment assignment of the study participants. A sufficient number of healthy infants will be recruited from the general population residing in the geographical area of the clinical site to participate and complete this study such that two hundred (200) infants, one hundred (100) per group, complete the study.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0150">Two subject groups will participate in this study. Both groups will include healthy infants, each comprising approximately 50% males and 50% females. The two groups will be age and/or diaper size balanced (when wearing appropriately sized diapers). The two groups will consist of healthy infants not taking medications for conditions other than those that are routine for that age, such as common cold/flu. All infants will present Fitzpatrick scale skin type of I-III, and with no evidence of serious dermatological conditions (i.e., not atopic). (Fitzpatrick I-III skin types facilitate erythema grading.) Some level of erythema and diaper rash in the diaper region is permissible (defined under exclusion criteria below).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0151">All infants who meet enrollment criteria will be assigned to use the control product for one week (baseline). At the end of one week, the infants will be randomly assigned into one of two possible groups: one group will remain on the control product for three weeks; the other group will use a test product for a period of three weeks. As such, the total duration of the test for both control and test product users is four weeks.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0152">At the point when infants are randomized (Visit 2) into two groups, no further use of ointments, creams, lotions, corn starch, or powders will permitted on the skin in the diaper area during the remaining period of the study. The use of soap, water, baby wipes, or cleansing gels is permitted at diaper changes and baths.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0153">The skin condition of infants will be evaluated at the following times: enrollment into the study (Visit 1); following one week baseline (Visit 2); twice per week for three weeks (Visits 3 through 8). Beginning with Visit 2, infants should be evaluated three hours (+/&#x2212;15 minutes) after being changed into a fresh diaper. (Preferably, this change being the first after the overnight diaper.) After Visit 2, subsequent visits should occur three to four days apart.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0167">2.3 Study Population</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0168">As indicated, at least two hundred (200) infants are expected to complete this study. Two subject groups will participate in this study, each group comprising approximately 50% males and 50% females. The two groups will be age and/or diaper size balanced (when wearing appropriately sized diapers). The study population will consist of healthy infants not taking medications for conditions other than those that are routine for that age such as common cold/flu, with a Fitzpatrick scale skin type of I-III, and no evidence of serious dermatological conditions (e.g., not atopic). The presence of erythema and diaper rash is permissible.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0169">2.3.1. Inclusion Criteria</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0170">Each Infant must:
<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0174">The eligibility of each potential infant is also determined by the completion of a medical and dermatological history questionnaire. Subjects will be excluded from this study for one or more of the reasons listed below under exclusion criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0175">2.3.2 Exclusion Criteria</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0176">Babies are excluded from participation in the study if:
<ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">

        <li id="ul0014-0005" num="0181">at Visit 1, they have a significant eruption in the diaper area and it is the opinion of the Clinical Research Organization's Principal Investigator or skin grader that the baby should be excluded.</li>
        <li id="ul0014-0006" num="0182">use medication of any kind (e.g., oral antibiotics, antifungal agents, corticosteroids taken orally or topically applied to the skin), which in the opinion of the Clinical Research Organization's Principal Investigator and/or skin grader may have an influence on baby's skin in the diaper area.</li>
        <li id="ul0014-0007" num="0183">they do not fit the diaper as determined at Visit 1.</li>
        <li id="ul0014-0008" num="0184">they have any other medical condition that could compromise the study.</li>

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0186">2.4 Test Materials</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0187">The two treatment groups that will be included in this study are as follows:
<ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0188">Test Group: will use diapers having a skin care composition that is transferred to the wearer during use.</li>
        <li id="ul0016-0002" num="0189">Control Group: will use equivalent diapers to the Test Group, but the diapers have no skin care composition that is transferred to the wearer during use.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0190">2.5 Randomization and Regimen</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0191">Infants will be randomly assigned, using a statistically valid randomization schedule, at Visit 2 to either the test or control product group. The groups should be balanced for age or diaper size, sex, and diaper rash severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe rash). Twins (or multiple births) will be assigned to use the same product.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0192">2.6 Regimen &#x26; Compliance with Treatment</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0193">Each infant should arrive at the investigative site at approximately the same time of the day for each visit. The infants are expected to wear their assigned products only.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">No ointments, creams, lotions, or powders should be used on the skin in the diaper area after visit 2. The use of soap, water, baby wipes, or cleansing gels is permitted at diaper changes.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0194">Subjects should come to the site such that when their skin is evaluated they will have been wearing a product for three hours (+/&#x2212;15 minutes). Preferably, this product is the one immediately following the overnight diaper. In the event of a bowel movement within the 3 hour time frame, the diaper should be changed as needed, and skin evaluation should proceed as scheduled.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0195">2.7 Blinding</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0196">The test is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group comparison clinical trial in which a trained skin grader conducting skin evaluations, as well as the caregiver of the panelists, will be unaware of the treatment assignment of the study participants.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0197">2.8 Subject Discontinuation/Termination</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0198">In addition to the exclusion criteria, a baby will be dropped from the study due to:
<ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0204">2.9 Observations and/or Measurements</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0205">Skin evaluations will be conducted by a trained skin grader who will be blinded as to the assignment of treatments for each subject. The same grader should be used for all examinations. The grader should be experienced in evaluating infant skin conditions in the diapered region, especially diaper rash. Preferably, the grader will be a nurse. The grader will be separated from the area where the diapers are removed so that the grader will not see what diapers the babies are wearing.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0206">At each examination period, each baby will be examined for erythema first, then diaper rash, at 4 locations on the body (genitals, intertriginous, anal, and buttocks).</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0207">Erythema and diaper rash severity will each be evaluated using the grading scales shown below. A pictorial description of the 4 diaper locations are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>through <b>2</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">3. Statistical Methods</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0208">3.1 Planned Statistical Analyses</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0209">For purposes of the present disclosure, evidence of a test product improvement in rash or erythema is defined as a statistical or non-statistical (as defined above) difference at: (a) one or more of the 4 skin grading locations for the study group as a whole; or (b) one or more of the 4 skin grading locations for any gender or age or diaper size subset of the study group.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0210">Baseline Visit will be defined as Visit 2; post-baseline visits will be defined as Visits 3 through 8. For all parameters, separate analyses will be done for each site. The same analyses will be done on the erythema (i.e., redness) severity grades as for the diaper rash severity grades. The primary comparison of interest is between the treatment groups.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0211">The frequency of diaper rash (or erythema) will be analyzed in two ways. First, the presence of diaper rash (erythema) at any time during the course of the study will be evaluated. For each treatment group, the number and percentage of infants for which diaper rash (or erythema) was present (i.e., diaper rash severity grade is greater than 0 at any post-baseline visit) and absent (i.e., diaper rash severity grade equals 0 for every post-baseline visit) will be calculated. These dichotomous treatment group responses (i.e., presence and absence) will be analyzed using a chi-square test. The effects of sex or age or diaper size should be investigated using Mantel-Haenszel statistics or, if appropriate, a weighted least squares or loglinear categorical model.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0212">The second way in which diaper rash (or erythema) frequency will be analyzed is to evaluate the number of post-baseline visits at which diaper rash (or erythema) was present for each subject (i.e., diaper rash grade greater than zero). The number of post-baseline visits with diaper rash (or erythema) will be analyzed using a loglinear Poisson regression model. The effects of sex or age or diaper size should be investigated by incorporating these effects into the model.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0213">Diaper rash (or erythema) severity will be analyzed by evaluating average diaper rash (or erythema) severity over all post-baseline visits. For each subject, the average of all post-baseline visit diaper rash (or erythema) severity grades will be computed. These average severity grades will be analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance model. A transformation (e.g., log) may be done prior to analysis to improve the distributional characteristics of the averages (i.e., improve the homogeneity of the treatment group variances, improve the normality of the analysis of variance residuals). Alternatively, a nonparametric analog to the one-way analysis of variance may be done (e.g., Wilcoxon's Rank Sum Test) if the analysis of variance residuals do not adequately fit a normal distribution and/or the treatment group variances are not homogenous enough. The effects of sex or age or diaper size should be investigated by incorporating these effects into the analysis of variance model.</p>

B. Transfer of Skin Care Composition to Wearer's Skin
<br/>
Overview
</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0216">This method uses a removable skin analog material that is placed on a wearer's skin for a controlled period of time. After the skin analog has been removed, it is extracted using an appropriate solvent and the amount of skin care composition deposited thereon is determined using known analytical methods.

Extraction and Analysis
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0248">This method is designed for use with the preferred skin care composition, the skin care composition of Table 1. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize what adaptions may be necessary to extract and analyze the level of other skin care compositions. In principle: 1) one of the major ingredients of the composition is extracted from the skin analog using an appropriate solvent; 2) gas chromatographic or other appropriate quantitative analytical techniques are then used to determine the level of the major ingredient in the extract; 3) amount of skin care composition is calculated per unit area based on amount of major ingredient in extract and the area of the tape.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Internal Standard/Extraction Solvent</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0249">Prepare an internal standard/extraction solvent by accurately weighing 100&#xb1;2 mg of 1-hexadecanol into a small beaker. Dissolve the 1-hexadecanol in dichloromethane and transfer to a 1 liter volumetric flask. Rinse the beaker 3 more times with dichloromethane transferring each rinse portion to the volumetric flask. Fill the volumetric flask to volume and mix well. This solution will be used to deliver the internal standard and extract skin care composition from the tapes. When not being used, this container should be kept tightly capped to prevent evaporation of solvent.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Calibration Standard</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0250">Prepare a calibration standard of known concentration by accurately weighing (&#xb1;0.1 mg) 10&#xb1;1 mg of the stearyl alcohol into a 100 ml volumetric flask. Record the weight of stearyl alcohol used. Add the internal standard/extraction solvent to the flask and mix to dissolve. Fill to volume and mix well. When not being used, this container should be kept tightly capped to prevent evaporation of solvent. This solution will be used to determine the relative response of the stearyl alcohol to the 1-hexadecanol internal standard for calibration of the instrument.</p>

B. Water Vapor Transmission Rate Measurement
</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0279">The Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR) for the sample materials was calculated in accordance with ASTM Standard E96-80. Circular samples measuring three inches in diameter were cut from each of the test materials and a control which was a piece of CELGUARD&#xae; 2500 film from Hoechst Celanese Corporation of Sommerville, N.J. CELGUARD&#xae; 2500 film is a microporous polypropylene film. Five samples were prepared for each material. The test dish was a number 60-1 Vapomoter pan distributed by Thwing-Albert Instrument Company of Philadelphia, Pa. One hundred millimeters of water were poured into each Vapometer pan and individual samples of the test materials and control material were placed across the open tops of the individual pans. Screw-on flanges were tightened to form a seal along the edges of the pan, leaving the associated test material or control material exposed to the ambient atmosphere over a 6.5 centimeter diameter circle having an exposed area of approximately 33.17 square centimeters. The pans were placed in a forced air over at 100&#xb0; F. (32&#xb0; C.) for 1 hour to equilibrate. The oven was a constant temperature oven with external air circulating through it to prevent water vapor accumulation inside. A suitable forced air oven is, for example, a Blue M Power-O-Matic <b>60</b> oven distributed by Blue M Electric Company of Blue Island, Ill. Upon completion of the equilibration, the pans were removed from the oven, weighed and immediately returned to the oven. After 24 hours, the pans were removed from the oven and weighed again. The preliminary test water vapor transmission rate values were calculated as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Test WVTR=(grams weight loss over 24 hours)&#xd7;315.5<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

The relative humidity within the oven was not specifically controlled.
</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0280">Under predetermined set conditions of 100&#xb0; F. (32&#xb0; C.) an ambient relative humidity, the WVTR for the CELGUARD&#xae; 2500 control has been determined to be 5000 grams per square meter for 24 hours. Accordingly, the control sample was run with each test and the preliminary test values are corrected to set conditions using the following equation:

<heading id="h-0033" level="1">Example 6</heading>
<heading id="h-0034" level="1">Breathable Films</heading>
<p id="p-0215" num="0290">Three breathable films with varying polymer blends were prepared and then each of the films were prepared. Each of the film formulations contained, on a total weight percent basis, 65% English China Supercoat calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) with a 1 micron average particle size and a 7 micron top cut. The calcium carbonate was obtained form ECCA Calcium Products, Inc. in Sylacauga, Ala., a division of ECC International. The calcium carbonate was blended with 15-25% by weight of linear low density polyethylene made from a blend of DOWLEX&#xae; 2517 linear low density polyethylene and DOWLEX&#xae; 2532 linear low density polyethylene blended in a weight ratio of 1:4 such that the melt indenx of the blend was 10 M.I. (/10 minutes at 190&#xb0; F.). The DOWLEX&#xae; polymers are available from Dow Chemical U.S.A., Midland, Mich. The remaining 10-20% by weight of the formulation comprised Himont KS051P polypropylene-based polymer from Himont, USA of Wilmington, Del. The KS051P polymer is an olefinic thermoplastic elastomer or TPO multistep reactor product wherein an amorphous ethylene propylene random copolymer is molecularly dispersed in a predominately semicrystalline high polypropylene monmer/low ethylene monomer continuous matrix. The amorphous component acts as the tacktifying or bonding agent as it begins to soften at about 55&#xb0; C. As shown in Table I below, sample 1 contained 65% calcium carbonate, 10% KS051P polymer and 25% linear low density polyethylene. Sample 2 contained 65% calcium carbonate, 15% KS051P polymer and 20% linear low density polyethylene. The third sample contained 65% calcium carbonate, 20% KS051P polymer and 15% linear low density polyethylene. Each of the three formulations were blown into films at a melt temperature of 375&#xb0; F. (191&#xb0; C.) at a blow up ratio of approximately 1.7 to produce films having an unstretched gauge of approximately 1.25 mils (50 gsm). Each of the films was subsequently stretched on a machine direction orientation (MDO) unit at a stretch ratio of 3&#xd7; and at a temperature of 140&#xb0; F. (60&#xb0; C.). The resultant films were breathable as indicated by the water vapor transmission rate data set forth in Table II below and has basis weights of approximately 14 grams per square meter.</p>

<p id="p-0217" num="0292">In this Example, 65% by weight calcium carbonate and 30% by weight linear low density polyethylene were blended. As shown by Table III, to the basic blend there was added a series of recognized tacktifying or bonding agents in a weight percent of 5%. The bonding agents included REGALREZ&#xae; 1094, 3102 and 1126 bonding agents as well as ZONATAC&#xae; 501L and EASTMAN&#xae; 1023PL bonding agents. In addition, the film formulation from sample 2 of Example 6 was also formed into a film in the same fashion as described with respect to Example 6. Each of the films was blown at a blow-up ratio of 1.7 to a guage of approximately 1.5 mils (60 gsm). The films were stretched at 146&#xb0; F. (63&#xb0; C.) in the machine direction to three times (3&#xd7;) their original length. This stretching temperature which was below the melting point (235&#xb0; F./113&#xb0; C.) of the predominately linear polyolefin polymers. The water vapor transmission rate for each of the films was measured. The results are presented in Table III below.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the invention relate generally to electric drive systems including hybrid and electric vehicles and to stationary drives that are subject to transient or pulsed loads and, more particularly, to transferring energy between an electrical storage device of the vehicle or drive and a power source external to the vehicle or drive.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hybrid electric vehicles may combine an internal combustion engine and an electric motor powered by an energy storage device, such as a traction battery, to propel the vehicle. Such a combination may increase overall fuel efficiency by enabling the combustion engine and the electric motor to each operate in respective ranges of increased efficiency. Electric motors, for example, may be efficient at accelerating from a standing start, while combustion engines may be efficient during sustained periods of constant engine operation, such as in highway driving. Having an electric motor to boost initial acceleration allows combustion engines in hybrid vehicles to be smaller and more fuel efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Purely electric vehicles use stored electrical energy to power an electric motor, which propels the vehicle and may also operate auxiliary drives. Purely electric vehicles may use one or more sources of stored electrical energy. For example, a first source of stored electrical energy may be used to provide longer-lasting energy while a second source of stored electrical energy may be used to provide higher-power energy for, for example, acceleration.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Plug-in electric vehicles, whether of the hybrid electric type or of the purely electric type, are configured to use electrical energy from an external source to re-charge the traction battery. Such vehicles may include on-road and off-road vehicles, golf cars, neighborhood electric vehicles, forklifts, and utility trucks as examples. These vehicles may use either off-board stationary battery chargers or on-board battery chargers to transfer electrical energy from a utility grid or renewable energy source to the vehicle's on-board traction battery. Plug-in vehicles may include circuitry and connections to facilitate the re-charging of the traction battery from the utility grid or other external source, for example. The battery charging circuitry, however, may include dedicated components such as boost converters, high-frequency filters, choppers, inductors, and other electrical components dedicated only to transferring energy between the on-board electrical storage device and the external source. These additional dedicated components add extra cost and weight to the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would therefore be desirable to provide an apparatus to facilitate the transfer of electrical energy from an external source to the on-board electrical storage device of a plug-in vehicle that reduces the number of components dedicated only to transferring energy between the on-board electrical storage device and the external source.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect of the invention, an apparatus comprises an energy storage device configured to supply electrical energy, a first bi-directional DC-to-DC voltage converter coupled to the energy storage device, and a first input device configured to receive electrical energy from a first external energy source. A voltage bus is coupled to the first bi-directional DC-to-DC voltage converter and to the first input device, and a voltage inverter is coupled to the voltage bus and configured to convert a voltage on the voltage bus that is supplied by the energy storage device and the first bi-directional DC-to-DC voltage converter into an AC voltage suitable for driving an electromechanical device. The apparatus comprises a controller configured to control the first bi-directional DC-to-DC voltage converter to convert a first charging energy on the voltage bus into a second charging energy suitable for charging the energy storage device during a charging operation and to monitor a voltage of the energy storage device during the charging operation. The controller is also configured to control the first bi-directional DC-to-DC voltage converter to convert the first charging energy into a third charging energy configured to maintain the voltage of the energy storage device at a pre-determined value.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method of manufacturing includes providing a first energy storage device, coupling a first bi-directional buck/boost converter to the first energy storage device, and coupling a voltage bus to the first bi-directional buck/boost converter. The method also includes coupling a voltage inverter to the voltage bus and configuring the voltage inverter to convert a voltage on the voltage bus supplied by the first energy storage device and the first bi-directional buck/boost converter into an AC voltage suitable for driving an electromechanical device. The method further includes coupling a first connector to the voltage bus, the connector configured to receive electrical energy from a first external energy source and configuring a controller to cause the first bi-directional buck/boost converter to convert a first charging energy on the voltage bus into a second charging energy suitable for charging the first energy storage device during a charging operation. The controller is also configured to monitor a voltage of the first energy storage device during the charging operation, and cause the first bi-directional DC-to-DC voltage converter to convert the first charging energy into a third charging energy configured to maintain the voltage of the first energy storage device at a pre-determined value.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a system comprises a charge bus configured to receive charging energy from a voltage source external to the system, a connector coupled to the charge bus and configured to transfer the charging energy from the voltage source to the charge bus, and a voltage inverter coupled to the charge bus. The system also comprises an energy storage device configured to output a DC voltage and a bi-directional voltage converter coupled between the charge bus and the energy storage device and configured charge the energy storage device via conversion of a voltage on the voltage bus during a charging operation. A controller is included and is configured to monitor a transfer of the charging energy supplied to the energy storage device during the charging operation and to control the bi-directional voltage converter to modify a current supplied to the energy storage device after the monitored transfer of the charging energy has crossed a threshold.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">By way of summation and review, functions of a display including a plurality of organic light emitting elements are deteriorated when a display is exposed to moisture and oxygen. Thus, it is important to seal the display to suppress the infiltration of external moisture and oxygen. Furthermore, as an area of the OLED display increases, a light thin sealing structure having excellent heat-radiating effect is required.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Embodiments may be directed to an OLED display having an advantage of improving a sealing performance of a display unit to increase display quality and life-span of the display unit.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In further detail, the OLED display includes multi-layered blocking structures in a thickness direction and a surface direction to improve sealing performance. A sealing member of the OLED has satisfactory heat-radiating effect, low material cost, and low manufacturing cost. Thus, the sealing member can be easily applied to a large-size OLED display. In addition, the OLED display includes a supporting layer having high bending strength to reinforce the strength of the sealing member. Thus, deformation of the sealing member caused by external interference can be minimized. Furthermore, the OLED display can improve the luminance uniformity of the display unit while implementing a large-size display unit. The OLED display includes a pad area located at one edge of the substrate to simplify the overall structure, manufacturing process, and reduce the manufacturing cost.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to systems and methods for performing NPICD for step-down switching regulators.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Discontinuous operation occurs in circumstances of light load when using a non-synchronous buck regulator. In the case of a synchronous BUCK regulator, optimizing the efficiency of the regulator, with light load requires turning off the Low Side FET for a portion of the switching cycle. In this circumstance, the LOW SIDE FET is disabled for one switching cycle after the cycle in which the inductor current has reversed direction or has zero volts across the inductor prior to turning on the High Side FET. Turning off the LOW SIDE FET in this circumstance improves the light load efficiency by preventing needless discharge of the output capacitor and by reducing the switching losses due to turning on and off the NFET. Determination is made during the time the Low Side FET is off and prior to the turn on of the High Side FET, by sensing the voltage polarity across the Low Side Body diode. Ideally the LOW SIDE FET is shut off and held off (for the remainder of the switching cycle) when the inductor current reverses. However with light loads, there are still significant efficiency benefits, if the low side FET is held off for the entirety of the switching cycle (as opposed to only a portion of the switching cycle). In this case the BUCK regulator is operating non-synchronously.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a conventional implementation for turning off the Low side FET, represented by &#x201c;NFET&#x201d; <b>14</b>, in the circumstance when negative current in the inductor is present. Negative inductor current is defined as current flowing from the inductor into either the high or low side power transistors. FET <b>18</b> is a pull up and is connected between VDD and NFET <b>14</b>. If negative current is not present in inductor <b>20</b> then the output of comparator <b>30</b> is LOW and flip flop (FF) <b>10</b> is SET when NFET <b>14</b> control goes HIGH. In this case, the LOW SIDE FET is turned on as both inputs to AND <b>12</b> are asserted HIGH. If after the LOW SIDE FET is on, the current in inductor <b>20</b> goes negative, comparator <b>30</b> output goes HIGH and is sent to AND <b>40</b> when NFET control is high, thus resetting FF <b>10</b> and forcing the Q output LOW, thereby shutting off the NFET <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, detection of negative current occurs while the LOW SIDE FET is turned on. LOW SIDE FET on resistance is typically very low (a few milliohms) for optimal efficiency. As such the voltage generated (due to negative inductor current) at the input to the comparator can be very small (in the order of a few mille volts) particularly since it is important to detect small negative currents (for optimal efficiency).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Small input voltages to the comparator are problematic in two regards: 1. Input offsets to the comparator can cause erroneous operation 2. Small overdrive typically translates to slow comparator response time. Overcoming these two issues greatly complicates the design and efficiency gain of the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Overcoming the offset issue forces the comparator <b>30</b> to be implemented with either large input structures or switch capacitor techniques either of which require more die area. Often a known comparator offset is introduced to swamp out the random offset. This fixed offset forces the detected negative current to be larger than would otherwise be necessary, thereby degrading the efficiency of the circuit. The small overdrive forces the current burned in the comparator <b>30</b> to be high in order to speed up the circuit. This in turn degrades the efficiency of the circuit.</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect current detector for an output load includes a high side power transistor; a low side power transistor coupled to the high side power transistor; and a controller coupled to the high and low side power transistors to provide cycle by cycle conduction of the low side power transistor after detection of zero or negative current in the output load.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, a system includes a step-down switching regulator to supply power to an output load including an inductor; and a current detector coupled to the output inductor to detect a non-positive inductor current with a high side power transistor; a low side power transistor coupled to the high side power transistor; and a controller coupled to the high and low side power transistors to provide cycle by cycle conduction of the low side power transistor after detection of zero or negative current in the output inductor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Implementations of the above aspects can include one or more of the following. The controller detects zero or negative current in the output inductor using a dead time between when the low side power transistor turns off and before the high side power transistor turns on. The controller detects a condition when the high side power transistor and low side power transistor are off and the positive or negative going voltage at the switch node output of a switching regulator exceeds a predetermined voltage. The low and high side power transistors can be field effect transistors (FETs), and each FET is coupled to a body diode. A comparator is connected to a junction between the high and low side power transistors. A logic gate can be connected to the comparator. A flip-flop can be connected to the comparator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further aspect, a current detector for an output load with an inductor can include a high side power field effect transistor (FET); a low side FET coupled to the high side FET; and a controller coupled to the high and low side FETs to provide cycle by cycle conduction of the low side power transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Implementation of the above aspect can include the following. The controller can have a means to detect zero or negative current in the output inductor of a synchronous switching regulator using the dead time between when the low side FET turns off, before the high side FET turns on; and a means to detect when the high side FET and low side FET are off and the positive or negative going voltage at a switch node output of a switching regulator exceeds a threshold voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Advantages of the preferred embodiments may include one or more of the following. The Non-Positive Inductor Current Detector (NPICD) provides an effective means to determine when to turn off the Low Side FET to optimize efficiency. It does this by determining when the current in the inductor reaches zero or goes negative (i.e. is non-positive) without the need for detecting the small voltages as conventionally required. As such the design, power requirements and offset sensitivity of the comparator are greatly improved as well as the overall efficiency of the regulator. Rather than detecting the zero current condition while the LOW SIDE FET is on, the NPICD detects this condition during the dead time when both the High Side and Low Side FETs are off.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one implementation of NPICD in accordance with the invention. An inductor <b>220</b> is connected at a junction between a LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> and a HIGH SIDE FET <b>218</b>. A capacitor <b>222</b> is connected to the other end of the inductor <b>220</b>. The LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> has a body diode <b>216</b>, while the HIGH SIDE FET <b>218</b> has a body diode <b>219</b>. Periodically, the inductor <b>220</b> provides negative current that is sensed by a comparator <b>230</b> by comparing the output voltage against a reference source <b>226</b>. The comparator <b>230</b> is connected to an AND gate <b>240</b> outputting a WU signal. The AND gate <b>240</b> is also connected to the gate of HIGH SIDE FET <b>218</b> (PCH_ON bar signal) as well as the output of inverter <b>228</b>. The inverter <b>228</b> is connected to the gate of the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b>, which is driven by AND gate <b>212</b>. A flip-flop <b>210</b> is cleared by the WU signal and is set through an inverter <b>234</b> when NCH_ON goes LOW. The flip-flop <b>210</b> provides the output to the AND gate <b>212</b> to turn on or off the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">If there is only positive current in the inductor <b>220</b>, during the time between when the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> turns off and the PFET <b>218</b> turns on (i.e. the &#x201c;dead time&#x201d;) the output voltage at the switch node (i.e. the drains of the PFET and NFET) goes negative as body diode <b>216</b> continues to conduct the positive going current. With the switch node negative, the comparator <b>230</b> output is LOW, as is the output of AND <b>240</b>. With AND <b>240</b> at the LOW state, the D input flip flop (DFF) <b>210</b> is not cleared and the Q output remains HIGH for the next cycle. The Q output is driven HIGH when the NCH ON signal goes LOW which clocks the D input flip flop <b>210</b>. With the Q output HIGH, the next NCH ON signal passes though AND gate <b>212</b> to the gate input of the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> allowing it to be controlled by the NCH ON signal.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">If the inductor current is negative immediately after the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> shuts off and before the PFET <b>218</b> turns on the switch node immediately swings positive as the negative current conducts though body diode <b>219</b>. The comparator <b>230</b> detects this positive voltage and goes HIGH as does the output of AND <b>240</b>. As the PFET is off, the GATE of the PFET is HIGH and because the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> is off, the output of the inverter <b>228</b> connected to the GATE of the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> is also HIGH. With the WU signal HIGH, the D flip flop <b>210</b> is cleared and the Q output goes LOW. As the cycle continues, the PFET turns on and off, then the NCH ON signal is asserted. However, the DFF <b>210</b> remains cleared as it is only SET when the NCH ON signal is de-asserted. Consequently, the NCH ON signal does not pass through AND <b>212</b> and the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> remains off.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The signal detected by the comparator <b>230</b> is a very large signal near the supply rail. This large overdrive quickly moves the comparator output and swamps out any offsets in the comparator. Another case to consider is light load continuous operation wherein the current in the inductor transitions from a positive to a negative current part way through a switching cycle. This might happen, for example, if there is little or no load on the BUCK regulator output. In this circumstance, immediately after the HIGH SIDE FET <b>218</b> turns off and before the LOW SIDE FET <b>219</b> turns on, the voltage at the switch node output goes negative as body diode <b>216</b> continues to conduct the positive inductor current initiated when the HIGH SIDE FET <b>218</b> was on. If the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> turns on, the current decays and turns negative which will then be detected at the end of the switch cycle (i.e. when the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> turns off). From then on, the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> will remain off.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When transitioning from light load to heavy loads, the Low Side FET <b>214</b> will transition from being disabled to enabling every cycle automatically. As current increases in the inductor the operation moves from discontinuous conduction mode to continuous conduction mode. This becomes the case where there is only positive current in the inductor. In this circumstance, body diode <b>216</b> conducts current for the entirety of the dead time and the WU signal is never asserted. Though the previous examples have illustrated the operation of the NPICD detector with negative current, the NPICD does not require negative current to detect when to turn off the NFET. For example, in the no or light load circumstance when the HIGH SIDE FETS <b>218</b> is turned off and the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> has been held off by the NPICD, the voltage at the switching node does not necessarily swing sufficiently positive to turn on body diode <b>219</b>. In this circumstance the voltage at the switch node is driven to the output voltage of the BUCK regulator though the inductor (after the positive current from the PFET being on decays in the inductor).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The switch node can exhibit &#x201c;ringing&#x201d; due to the resonance of the output inductor and the stray capacitance at the switch node. However, the center point of the ringing is equal to the BUCK regulator output voltage. This occurs as an ideal inductor cannot sustain a DC voltage across it. In any case, this voltage is sufficiently positive to provide a large amount of over drive to the comparator and to sustain the off condition of the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the discontinuous mode of operation, the NPICD operates to hold off the LOW SIDE FET <b>214</b> for the entirety of the switching cycle. This means that the body diode <b>216</b> will conduct current for a portion of the cycle. This body diode conduction introduces some power loss as given by the product of the current through the body diode times the forward diode voltage drop. A more optimal solution would act to turn on the LOW SIDE FET for the portion of the cycle the inductor current is positive, and to turn off the LOW SIDE FET when the inductor current reached zero. This enhanced operation is possible with a modification of the NPICD called the &#x201c;Adaptive NPICD&#x201d; and is described in detail in co-pending application serial no. 13562317, the content of which is incorporated by reference.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-125387, filed Dec. 10, 2008, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Apparatuses and methods consistent with the present invention relate to a step-down converter and a power supply, and more particularly, to a step-down converter and a power supply which can be stably operated at a time of an initial start up by outputting a voltage lower than an input voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a power supply converts electric power supplied from an external source in accordance with a demand of an internal system and supplies the converted electric power. An example of such a power supply includes a switched-mode power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The switched-mode power supply controls the flow of electric power using a switching process of a semiconductor element. Because the switched-mode power supply has high efficiency, small size, and light weight, it is widely used for electric, electronic, and communication apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A DC-DC converter is an example of the switched-mode power supply. The DC-DC converter converts a direct current (DC) voltage from one level to another level. There are various types of DC-DC converters for outputting a desired voltage based on an input voltage, such as, for example, a buck or step-down converter, a boost converter, and a fly back converter.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The step-down converter outputs an output voltage lower than an input voltage. The step-down converter has a switching element and an energy storage element to perform switching operation and generate an output voltage lower than an input voltage. An N-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor (NMOS) transistor may be used as a switching element of the step-down converter because of the ease of integration and low price.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to perform the switching operation, the NMOS transistor should have a gate voltage Vgs greater than a threshold voltage. Therefore, the step-down converter using the NMOS transistor employs a boost capacitor and uses a voltage charged in the boost capacitor in the switching operation as a gate driver power of the NMOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One drawback of a related art step-down converter is that an input voltage may become lower than an output voltage depending on the load conditions of an input and an output after completing the converting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates a waveform diagram of an input voltage V<sub>in </sub>and an output voltage V<sub>out </sub>when the electric power is interrupted in a related art step-down converter. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, if the electric discharge of an input is faster than that of an output, the output voltage becomes greater than the input voltage after a time T<sub>1</sub>. At this time, if the step-down converter begins to operate, the boost capacitor cannot perform charging operation in the state that the output voltage is greater than the input voltage. Accordingly, the operation of the step-down converter may result in a fault.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention overcome the above disadvantages and other disadvantages not described above. Also, the present invention is not required to overcome the disadvantages described above, and an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may not overcome any of the problems described above.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention provides a step-down converter and a power supply which provide an output voltage of the step-down converter lower than an input voltage even when the converting operation of the step-down converter is completed, thereby maintaining stable operation of the power supply and the step-down converter at a time of an initial start up.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a step-down converter including: a DC-DC converter which performs DC-DC converting using a boost capacitor and a NMOS transistor, and an electric discharge circuit which makes a voltage of an output of the DC-DC converter less than or equal to a voltage of an input of the DC-DC converter.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The electric discharge circuit may include a voltage divider which divides the voltage of the input, and a diode which discharges the voltage of the output if the voltage divided by the voltage divider is less than or equal to a pre-set voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The voltage divider may include a first resistor which is provided at the input, and a second resistor which is connected to the first resistor in series.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The diode may have an anode end connected to one side of the output and a cathode end connected to a node between the first resistor and the second resistor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">If the DC-DC converter performs DC-DC converting operation, a node voltage between the first resistor and the second resistor may be greater than or equal to a voltage value equaling the voltage of the output minus a threshold voltage of the diode.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The electric discharge circuit may make the voltage of the output less than or equal to the voltage of the input if the DC-DC converting operation of the DC-DC converter is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The DC-DC converter may include a NMOS transistor which performs switching operation using a boost capacitor, an inductor and a capacitor which accumulate energy according to turn-on of the NMOS transistor, and a switching unit which forms a loop between the inductor and the capacitor when the NMOS transistor is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a power supply including: a power supply unit which supplies a DC voltage, and a step-down converter which has a boost capacitor and an NMOS transistor and performs DC-DC converting operation if a DC voltage is supplied from the power supply unit, and the step-down converter may include an electric discharge circuit which makes a voltage of an output of the step-down converter less than or equal to a voltage of an input of the step-down converter.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The electric discharge circuit may include a voltage divider which divides the voltage of the input; and a diode which discharge the voltage of the output if the voltage divided by the voltage divider is less than or equal to a pre-set voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The voltage divider may include a first resistor which is provided at the input, and a second resistor which is connected to the first resistor in series.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The diode may have an anode end connected to one side of the output and a cathode end connected to a node between the first resistor and the second resistor.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">If a DC voltage is supplied from the power supply unit, a node voltage between the first resistor and the second resistor may be greater than or equal to a voltage value which equals the voltage of the output minus a threshold value of the diode.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The voltage divider may make the voltage of the output less than or equal to the voltage of the input if electric power supplied from the power supply unit is interrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The step-down converter may include a NMOS transistor which performs switching operation with respect to the DC voltage of the power supply unit using a boost capacitor, an inductor and a capacitor which accumulate energy according to turn-on of the NMOS transistor, and a diode which forms a loop between the inductor and the capacitor when the NMOS transistor is turned on.</p>

A diode <b>260</b> (D<sub>2</sub>) forms a loop between the inductor <b>240</b> and the capacitor <b>250</b> according to the switching operation of the NMOS transistor <b>270</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and apparatus for a sensor network having a plurality of reference nodes and a sensor node that enables the sensor node to compute a relative position through transmission range control and position mapping. In transmission range control, each reference node sends location information signals to the sensor node while varying transmission power. In position mapping, the sensor node forms a grid of vertical and horizontal lines corresponding to a square area defined by the neighboring reference nodes, extracts coordinates of intersections in the grid belonging to a shared region between areas covered by location information signals of various transmit power levels from the neighboring reference nodes, and sets the position of the sensor node to the middle points of the extracted coordinates. Each reference node sends a location information signal when a random backoff time expires after reception of a location information request signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to an application entitled &#x201c;METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR LOCATING SENSOR NODE IN SENSOR NETWORK USING TRANSMIT POWER CONTROL&#x201d; filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Nov. 15, 2007 and assigned Serial No. 2007-0116815, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a sensor network including reference nodes and sensor nodes. More particularly, the present invention relates to a sensor node locating method and system that enable a sensor node to receive location information signals with successively varying signal strength from plural reference nodes and to compute the coordinates of the location of the sensor node and an associated error.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is expected that various new services will be created in the near future through ubiquitous computing or ubiquitous networks. In particular, location-based services, based on identification of locations of objects, such as persons and things anytime anywhere, are on the rise as important services. Location-based services using location and geographical information have demonstrated their usefulness in various fields, and are advancing beyond a particular business area to technologies heightening the value of an entire country. Most location-based services have been developed using the Global Positioning System (GPS), and ignored shadow areas. Currently, research is underway to provide location-based services in shadow areas, with the help of existing massive network infrastructure and digital equipment. In particular, active research is in progress by many in the field, particularly with regard to position locating techniques based on sensor networks because of their wide application areas.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Sensor network-based locating techniques are used in diverse application areas including logistics, security, home automation, factory automation, and building automation, and are particularly effective for services utilizing locations of individual persons and things such as protection of elderly and disabled persons or children, identification of positions of soldiers in battle, rescue of firefighters isolated or lost in the scene of a fire, and medical treatment. The content of information to be collected from sensor networks tends to be growing, and, in particular, identification of the location of a person wearing a sensor or a thing with an attached sensor has become important.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Infrared rays, ultrasonic waves and radio frequency (RF) waves are used for locating positions of objects such as persons. RF-based position location may result in a large error in the determined position and the actual position, because RF signals are very sensitive to external environmental conditions. RF-based locating services require accuracy in obtained location data. Hence, there is a need to provide a technique that increases accuracy in position locating so that an RF-based locating system can extend the service area to cover shadow areas.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made in part in view of at least some of the above problems, and the present invention provides a method and system for locating a sensor node in a sensor network. The sensor network includes reference nodes and sensor nodes. In response to a signal requesting location information from a sensor node, a reference node sends its location information to the sensor node while varying transmission power (transmission range control). After reception of location information signals from plural reference nodes, the sensor node forms a grid corresponding to a typically square area defined by absolute coordinates of the reference nodes, and calculates its own location (position mapping) and an associated error.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a position locating system for a sensor network, which may include:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a plurality of reference nodes, each having location information; and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a sensor node computing a location thereof on the basis of location information of the reference nodes. One or more of the reference nodes may include a control section generating, upon reception of a location information request signal, a location information signal including a transmit power level and location information of the reference node; and</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">a radio frequency (RF) section forwarding the received location information request signal to the control section, controlling transmission power according to the transmit power level of the control section to send the generated location information signal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, one or more of the sensor nodes may include a control unit computing a location of the sensor node and associated error on the basis of location information signals received from multiple neighbor reference nodes;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">an RF unit sending a location information request signal, and receiving location information signals and forwarding the same to the control unit; and</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">a storage unit storing the location information signals received from multiple neighbor reference nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for a sensor network having a plurality of reference nodes and a sensor node, which may include transmitting, by the sensor node, a location information request signal; and transmitting, by neighbor reference nodes in response to reception of the location information request signal, location information signals to the sensor node while varying transmission power; and</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">computing, by the sensor node, a location of the sensor node and associated error after reception and analysis of the location information signals.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another exemplary aspect of the present invention, the location of a sensor node may be identified using transmission range control and position mapping. Reference nodes send location information upon request from sensor nodes, thereby reducing the amount of traffic generated in the network. Compared with triangulation, an exemplary aspect of the method of the present invention may perform more operations, but result in a smaller error range by using location information collected from, for example, four reference nodes forming a square to calculate its own location. In addition, the RF module of the present invention is advantageously more cost-effective than a module using a different wireless medium, and can be widely utilized.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The examples shown and described herein are provided for illustrative purposes only, and the claimed invention is not limited to the examples shown and described. The same reference symbols are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or similar parts. For the purposes of clarity and simplicity, detailed descriptions of well-known functions and structures incorporated herein may be omitted to avoid obscuring appreciation of the subject matter of the present invention by a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the description hereinbelow, a reference node is typically a node that is aware of its own absolute position. Upon reception of a signal requesting location information from a sensor node, the reference node sends location information to the sensor node while varying transmission power. The position of a reference node may be changed or fixed at a particular point according to its characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A sensor node is typically a node that sends a signal requesting location information to a reference node to identify its relative position.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which illustrates a sensor network including reference nodes <b>110</b> and sensor node <b>120</b>, a sensor node <b>120</b> sends a location information request signal to reference nodes <b>110</b> and then receives signals carrying location information from the reference node <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The reference nodes <b>110</b> are aware of their own absolute positions. Typically upon reception of a location information request signal from the sensor node <b>120</b>, the reference nodes <b>110</b> send their location information to the sensor node <b>120</b> while varying their transmission power. Absolute positions are given by a geographic code system including latitude and longitude. The reference nodes <b>110</b> may obtain their own location information using various techniques including the GPS. The positions of the reference nodes <b>110</b> may be changeable or fixed at particular points according to their characteristics. For position locating, the reference nodes <b>110</b> may be arranged to form a square, regular triangle, or regular hexagon. In the following description, the reference nodes <b>110</b> are assumed to be arranged at corners of a square.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to identify its relative position, the sensor node <b>120</b> sends a location information request signal to the reference nodes <b>110</b>. The sensor node <b>120</b> calculates its position and associated error range using received location information signals. The range of the sensor node <b>120</b> may be designed to be confined to an indoor environment such as a room or building.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sensor node <b>120</b> connects to the network, and sends a location information request signal to the reference nodes <b>110</b> in the vicinity if necessary. Upon reception of the request signal, the reference nodes <b>110</b> send their location information to the sensor node <b>120</b> while varying their transmission power. Location information from a reference node <b>110</b> includes message type, identifier of the reference node, absolute coordinates, transmit power level, maximum distance and minimum distance. The sensor node <b>120</b> receives location information signals, and calculates its position and an error comprising a difference between the calculated position and true position.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Upon reception of a location information request signal from a sensor node <b>120</b>, reference nodes <b>110</b> send location information signals to the sensor node <b>120</b> while varying transmission power according to their location information (transmission range control).

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to Table 2 above, at power level 1, a transmission signal can travel from a minimum distance of 0 cm to a maximum distance of 18 cm. At power level 2, a transmission signal can travel from a minimum distance of 0 cm to a maximum distance of about 80 cm. However, because the range between 0 cm and 10 cm can be covered by a transmission signal of power level 1, the range associated with a transmission signal of power level 2 is given by a range of about 19 to 80 cm. Accordingly, a sensor node requesting location information receives location information signals of various transmit power levels from the same reference node, and extracts location information from one of the received location information signals having the lowest transmit power level. For example, a sensor node at a range covered by power level 1 receives signals of 1 to 8 power levels, but uses only the signal of power level 1, sent at the lowest power level, for position locating.</p>

The reference node <b>110</b> may include an RF communication unit <b>300</b> including a duplexer <b>310</b>, RF receiver <b>320</b> and RF transmitter <b>330</b>, storage unit <b>340</b>, and control unit <b>350</b>. These functions may be incorporated by fewer components than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The duplexer <b>310</b> is connected to an antenna, and separates transmit and receive frequencies from each other to prevent interference. The RF receiver <b>320</b> low-noise amplifies a received signal and downconverts the frequency of the received signal, and the RF transmitter <b>330</b> upconverts the frequency of a signal to be transmitted and amplifies the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The storage unit <b>340</b> typically stores programs and data necessary for operating the reference node <b>110</b>. In particular, the storage unit <b>340</b> can store a program necessary for providing transmission range control.</p>

When in transmission range control, upon reception of a location information request signal from a sensor node <b>120</b>, the reference node <b>110</b> successively sends location information signals to the sensor node <b>120</b> while varying transmission power according to transmit power levels. Transmission ranges of location information signals transmitted by a reference node <b>110</b> with varying transmit power levels can be represented by donut-shapes as shown, for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The storage unit <b>440</b> stores programs and data necessary for operating the sensor node <b>120</b>. In particular, when transmit power levels of reference nodes are the same in pattern, the storage unit <b>440</b> can pre-store the information in Table 1 related to maximum and minimum transmission distances of location information signals according to transmit power levels, in which case location information from reference nodes <b>110</b> may not include data on maximum and minimum transmission distances.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The control unit <b>450</b> controls the overall operation of the sensor node <b>120</b>.

After reception of the location information signals having various transmit power levels, the control unit <b>450</b> can compute the relative position and associated error of the sensor node <b>120</b> through position mapping.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Position mapping is a technique that is employed by the present invention to determine the location of the sensor node <b>120</b>.

In the idle mode, the control unit <b>350</b> checks whether or not a location information request signal from a sensor node <b>120</b> is received through the RF receiver <b>320</b> (S<b>530</b>). If a location information request signal is received, the control unit <b>350</b> waits for a random backoff time (S<b>540</b>). After the random backoff time expires, the control unit <b>350</b> controls the RF transmitter <b>330</b> to successively send location information signals to the sensor node <b>120</b> while varying transmission power according to the transmit power level related to location information (transmission range control). In other words, the control unit <b>350</b> controls the RF transmitter <b>330</b> to send a location information signal corresponding to a preset transmit power level to the sensor node <b>120</b> (S<b>550</b>). The control unit <b>350</b> checks whether the current transmit power level is equal to the highest transmit power level (S<b>560</b>). If the current transmit power level is not equal to the highest transmit power level, the control unit <b>350</b> increases the current transmit power level (S<b>570</b>). The control unit <b>350</b> repeats steps S<b>550</b> and S<b>560</b> until the current transmit power level is equal to the highest transmit power level.

At step S<b>705</b>, a sensor node receives location information signals of various transmit power levels from a single reference node, and extracts location information from one of the received location information signals having the lowest transmit power level.

The control unit <b>450</b> selects one of the intersections, tests whether the selected intersection belongs to the shared region <b>810</b>, and stores, if the selected intersection belongs to the shared region <b>810</b>, the coordinates of the selected intersection in the storage unit <b>440</b>. This process is continued until all intersections are tested.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After testing all intersections, the control unit <b>450</b> computes the coordinates corresponding to the location of the sensor node <b>120</b> (S<b>770</b>). At step S<b>770</b>, the control unit <b>450</b> finds the maximum and minimum x and y values from the stored coordinates of those intersections belonging to the shared region <b>810</b>. For those intersections belonging to the shared region <b>810</b>, the minimum x-coordinate is denoted by x<sub>SS</sub>, the maximum x-coordinate is denoted by x<sub>SL</sub>, the minimum y-coordinate is denoted by y<sub>SS</sub>, and the maximum y-coordinate is denoted by y<sub>SL</sub>. Then, the location (x, y) of the sensor node <b>120</b> is given by Equation 1.</p>
