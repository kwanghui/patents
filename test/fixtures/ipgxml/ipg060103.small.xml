<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to bio-oxidation processes and reactors for the liberation of metals from minerals, especially sulphides, containing them.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Metal containing minerals, especially metal sulphides, may be oxidised using specific types of micro-organism, especially bacteria in a bioextraction, particularly a bio-oxidation process. Oxidation of sulphide minerals may be used to put the metals into solution, from for example iron, copper, zinc, nickel and cobalt sulphides, or to release precious metals, such as gold, silver and platinum, encapsulated in metal sulphides, particularly in refractory ores. The process is known as bacterial oxidation, bioextraction, bio-oxidation, bioleaching, or bacterial leaching. In this respect, pyrite, an iron sulphide, and arsenopyrite, an iron-arsenic sulphide are the most common minerals occluding gold in the so-called refractory gold ores and treatment of such materials by microorganisms may therefore assist in liberation of precious metals from refractory ores containing them.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Certain kinds of bacteria used in such processes have been documented and include the mesophiles, <i>Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, Thiobacillus thiooxidans, Leptospirillum ferrooxidans</i>, moderate thermophiles, and thermophiles such as <i>Sulpholobus. </i></p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above processes are the subject of an extensive literature encompassing papers and patents. However, conventional methods of bacterial oxidation involve oxidation in agitated stirred tanks into which air is introduced or in heaps using rocks with a size of 6 mm or greater in which fine particles may have been agglomerated or heaps using pelletised fine material. An acidic bacteria containing liquor is developed and typically used to irrigate the heap and facilitate metal extraction. The heap leaching technique has been used for many years and Brierley et al have patented a process (U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,486) for a two stage agglomeration process for the recovery of gold from sulphide minerals in heaps where the mineral particles are of large size and not slurried.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Van Aswegen in the article &#x201c;The Genmin Experience&#x201d;, has described bacterial oxidation in tanks made of stainless steel or other lined steel which contain a slurry of concentrate and water. The tanks are typically 9 meters high and 9 meters diameter and agitated with axial flow impellers which are driven by large motors. Compressed air is piped into the tank and sheared by the impellers Into a fine dispersion of bubbles to maintain a desired dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry. A variety of impeller types other than axial flow may be used such as turbines.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present applicant has found that such methods suffer from a number of disadvantages. Primary among these is the high power consumption and high capital cost encountered in employing bacterial oxidation reactors agitated by impellers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although proposals have been made to employ diffusion means to maintain particles in suspension, notably in Envirotech U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,728,082, 4,732,608, 4,968,008, 4,974,816 and 5,007,620, it is uniformly recognised that there is a need to provide some mechanical means, for example in the form of a rake to ensure that significant quantities of solids are not deposited on the floor of the reactor vessel, reducing reactor efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved process and apparatus for carrying out bacterial oxidation especially of metal sulphide minerals.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With this object in view, the present invention provides, in its first aspect, a process for recovering metals from materials containing them by bio-oxidation including treating, in a non-mechanically agitated reactor, a slurry containing a metal containing material with bacteria capable of promoting extraction of metals from said metal containing material; and maintaining said material in suspension and bacterial viability in the reactor by introducing an oxygen-containing gas to the slurry within the reactor by aeration means.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The aeration means advantageously introduces gases to the reactor in the form of bubbles of controlled size, generally of small diameter to enhance mass transfer of oxygen to bacteria. It will be understood, in this respect, that the bacterial oxygen demand is extremely high and oxygen diffusion characteristics important. Control of bubble size by shearing is not employed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Suitable aeration/agitation means may particularly and advantageously include diffusers as described hereinbelow. Diffusers are devices that will both introduce air or other gases to the slurry by diffusion mass transfer of gas from fine bubbles&#x2014;advantageously of controlled size&#x2014;to the solution or slurry and maintain solids in suspension for bacterial oxidation. Dome, tubular, disc or doughnut type diffusers may appropriately be used in accordance with the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Aeration means may include hydraulic shear devices. In such devices, very fine bubbles are formed by dislodgment thereof before full development under the influence of shear forces.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Surface aerators such as paddle aerators may be used to break liquid surface and assist in entrainment of gas such as air in the bulk reaction slurry. Reactor configuration may be varied to maximise aeration.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A further alternative would be the use of liquid jets where a stream of liquid from a reactor is pumped through a venturi which draws air into the liquid thereby aerating it. The aerated liquid is returned to the reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a particularly preferred embodiment, a gas appropriate for maintenance of bacterial viability include oxygen containing gases, such as air, oxygen enriched air or oxygen; optionally, with addition of carbon dioxide, such as air enriched with carbon dioxide, may be introduced to the aqueous solution by aeration means, particularly diffusers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Where a bio-oxidation process is involved, various chemolithotrophic bacteria may be employed. Various categories of bacteria may be employed in these processes. These categories are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">1) mesophiles which are suitable for oxidation in the range 10&#xb0; C. to 45&#xb0; c.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">2) moderate thermophiles, which oxidise the sulphide minerals in the range 40&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C.; and</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">3) thermophiles which oxidise from above 50&#xb0; C. to 90&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The process may be carried out employing any one or more such microorganisms, especially bacterial species, often referred to as a single or mixed culture respectively, which will oxidise sulphides or other minerals or metal containing materials in the required temperature range. Preferred mesophiles for use in bacterial oxidation are <i>Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, Thiobacillus thiooxidans </i>and <i>Leptospirillum ferrooxidans</i>. Most of the moderate thermophiles do not have specific names, but some have been referred to as <i>Sulphobacillus thermooxidans</i>. Preferably, the thermophilic bacteria will be of the type <i>Sulpholobus brierleyi, Sulpholobus BC</i>, and <i>Sulpholobus acidocaldarius</i>. Notwithstanding naming of species herein, similar iron and sulphur oxidising bacteria within the overall temperature range of 0&#xb0; C. to 90&#xb0; C. identified but not yet named are included within the scope of the present invention. The process is most advantageously conducted generally in the temperature ranges for which the bacteria are tolerant as described above. Reaction may be undertaken in the mesophilic, moderately thermophilic or extreme thermophilic temperature range.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Though the process may be employed exclusively for metal liberation, pre- or post- treatment by other metallurgical operations, such as CIP or CIL processes for recovery of precious metals for example, may be employed where desirable. Solid/liquid separation may typically follow bio-oxidation, liquor being further treated for metal recovery.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The process may be conducted in any suitable reactor, including those types of reactor already generally known to the art, operating advantageously on a continuous basis. Aeration may be achieved by including, in such reactors, suitable aeration means even in large capacity systems.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">However, it is intended that no mechanical means be employed within the reactor, that the introduction of gas be employed as the sole agency by which particles are maintained in suspension without significant build-up of mineral containing particles constituting the metal containing material on the floor of the reactor. Such a reactor may be said to be rakeless.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a particularly preferred embodiment, the metal containing material is, for example, a non-ferrous base metal sulphide ore, such as a copper, nickel, zinc, lead or cobalt containing ore, including mixed or polymetallic ores, or a refractory gold ore incorporating occluding sulphides amenable to dissolution by bacterial action. Other materials in this class may include flotation concentrates, gravity concentrates, tailings, precipitates, mattes and sulphidic fume. However, the above process is also suitable for carrying out bacterial oxidation and bioleaching of non-sulphide ores and other generally inorganic materials containing metals in economic concentrations, where suitable bacteria are available to carry out the process. For example, without intending to limit the invention in any way, bioleaching of rare earth ores, oxidic manganese ores and phosphate rock is possible in accordance with process of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a reactor system for bio-oxidation treatment of metal containing materials including at least one rakeless reactor having a reaction volume provided with aeration means for introducing an oxygen containing gas for maintaining said metal containing material in suspension and bacterial viability.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The reactor may take various forms, though incorporates no mechanical means of agitating the reactor volume, and may for example be in the form of tanks or vats. In this case, the reactor may be fabricated from suitable materials, steel, metal alloys or concrete optionally lined with an acid resistant medium. Additional materials of construction include wood, plastic, fibre-glass or any suitable aeration means may be as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Alternatively, a reactor may take a reservoir configuration being formed by excavation above or below ground. In such a case, the reservoir may be lined with a liquid impermeable barrier, such as clay or plastic membrane, to prevent solution entering the surrounding ground or rock. The reactor may be built from rock or other suitable material above the surrounding ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a reservoir configuration, though the following may be applicable to other types of suitable reactor, the reactor is preferably rectangular in plan section. The reactor may be tapered towards either end. When viewed from an end the reactor may also be rectangular in section though other shapes may be employed. The walls of the reactor may be substantially vertical or sloped. The depth of the reactor may typically be between 4 and 8 meters, and the width between 5 and 20 meters though both dimensions could be larger or smaller. Very large reactors, possibly having length greater than 100 meters, may be built and a number of reactors may be employed. Such reactor systems may be combined in series or operated in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The base of the reactor may be sloped so that there is a gradient from the feed end at which ore or other metal containing material is fed into the reactor to the discharge end. This slope may be a descending slope. The gradient of the reactor may be variable. This may assist in transfer of particles from feed to discharge. Volume of the reactor is calculated in dependence upon the rate at which the metal containing material or mineral is being treated.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Aerating means, or diffusers, may be located at even spacings along the base of the reactor. A concentration of diffusers may be determined as a function of oxygen demand in the reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Feed may be introduced at one end of the reactor through multiple points located along the width of one end. Distribution of slurry to these points may be via a ring main or splitter of conventional type.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">However, it is not intended to restrict possible reactor designs to the above configurations and other configurations could be employed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring specifically to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> to <b>4</b>, the gas is delivered through diffusers, i.e. a means for diffusing a gas into the liquid portion of a slurry or solution. Typically, compressed air&#x2014;though other gases as described above may be suitable&#x2014;is blown through gas supply line <b>10</b> to the diffuser unit <b>1</b> passing through a perforated wall <b>11</b> thereof forming air bubbles which serve to transfer oxygen and carbon dioxide into a slurry <b>2</b> in a reactor (not shown) for bacterial respiration and for oxidation of minerals. Gas supply line <b>10</b> may service a number of reactors. A slug flow introduction of air or gas to the reactor, that is, without control over bubble size at introduction to the reactor, is not desirable and is, most advantageously, to be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Diameter or size of the perforations <b>13</b> in wall <b>11</b> dictates bubble size, as desired, in a controlled manner. The smaller the bubble size the greater the surface area per unit of volume providing efficiency of gas-liquid contact allowing the high values of oxygen transfer that are necessary for efficient bacterial oxidation. Bubble size is to be maintained at 7.5 mm average diameter or less, preferably 5 mm average diameter or less.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Disc, doughnut or tubular designs may be employed, the first two types being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> to <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A disc diffuser, as seen in side section in FIG. <b>1</b> and plan in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is manufactured from a flexible membrane <b>15</b> that closes when no air is being delivered. This ensures that substantially no slurry enters gas supply line <b>10</b> during processing. The membrane <b>15</b> may be retained in position by a retaining device such as a clamping ring <b>16</b> which fixes the membrane in position <b>15</b> about an outlet <b>20</b> of the gas supply line <b>10</b>. As the membrane <b>15</b> expands with air flow, perforations in the form of pores in the membrane open allowing air flow therethrough. The pores <b>13</b> may advantageously be microscopic, of the order of 1 to 5&#x3bc; in diameter. As a result, impeller action is not required to shear air slugs to an appropriate bubble size distribution to optimum transfer of oxygen to the slurry. Further the mass transfer occurs in a readily controllable fashion and the bubble size may be controlled by selecting a membrane or other material (see below) with desired pore or hole size.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A doughnut shaped diffuser is shown in side section in FIG. <b>3</b> and plan in FIG. <b>4</b>. Again, a membrane <b>15</b> is employed which has the sarne characteristics as discussed above. However, here the gas supply line <b>10</b> serves further supply lines <b>23</b> feeding the doughnut shaped tube <b>24</b>, the walls of which are formed from membrane <b>15</b> thereby providing greater contact area of membrane <b>15</b> with solution or slurry.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Characteristics of membrane <b>15</b> may include flexibility, relatively low cost, durability and easy replacement. The membrane <b>15</b> may be formed from acid resistant rubber or other polymers with a pore size distribution as desired for use in the process. The membrane may be manufactured in a known manner in the field of membrane technology.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A further type of diffuser is of typically dome shape and manufactured from plastics or ceramics. The material is perforated with holes of similar diameter to that above that are fixed and open all the time allowing air to flow therethrough to form a bubble swarm in the slurry within the reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A particularly effective type of diffuser is tubular with the tubular body perforated with holes for gas exit preferably having a U-shaped configuration. The tubular body may be connected to the gas supply line and may be formed from a membrane or suitable plastic or ceramic material.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Diffusers suitable for the application will typically be sized to allow a sufficient volume of gas to be diffused into the slurry to achieve between 0.5 and 15 mg/l dissolved oxygen concentration in the slurry depending upon the oxygen requirement of the bacteria used in the bio-oxidation process. There may be provided a number of diffusers as necessary to maintain solids in suspension and supply sufficient gas for oxidation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Reactor configuration may be selected to achieve optimal aeration. Diffuser(s) <b>24</b> may be placed adjacent, that is at, or just off, the base of the reactor, if applicable, spaced at intervals&#x2014;possibly with different rates of gas introduction&#x2014;to give a suitable bubble distribution for the material being treated. The diffusers are fixed in position. Under different circumstances, the number of diffusers required to maintain the solids in suspension may be greater than that required for oxidation, at other times the number required may be lower. A uniform arrangement throughout the reactor base may be preferred. Conveniently, the number of aeration means or diffusers per unit area within the reactor may vary such that there is a greater proportion at the feed end of the reactor where higher rates of bacterial oxidation would be expected than at the discharge end.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show, without intending to limit the invention, likely flow circulation patterns for a number of tubular and disc diffusers located in a reactor <b>100</b>. It may be understood that each arrangement allows efficient mixing and bacterial/solid contacting though a disc diffuser arrangement may be preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> show a reactor <b>200</b> of rectangular plan having a sloped base <b>204</b>. The gradient of base <b>204</b> descends from feed end <b>208</b> (to which input slurry is introduced) to discharge end <b>212</b> (at which the output leached particles are removed). An overflow liquor stream <b>218</b> is removed to a metal recovery stage (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A number of diffusers <b>224</b> of tubular type are located evenly spaced along the base of the reactor <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Diffusers <b>224</b> are supplied with air by line <b>232</b> air is induced to flow through line <b>232</b> by induction fan <b>230</b>. Carbon dioxide supplement is introduced by line <b>226</b> to line <b>232</b>. Suitable diffusers <b>224</b> are of tubular fine bubble membrane type available in Australia from MRE, Adelaide, the distributor of Enviroquip &#xae; tubular diffusers. Such diffusers are particularly suitable for attachment to PVC pipe which may be conveniently used for line <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The tubular diffusers <b>224</b> are supplied with oxygen containing gas by a main pipe or manifold <b>225</b> of which the tubular diffusers <b>224</b> form lateral extensions covering the base of the reactor <b>200</b> as shown in FIG. <b>8</b>. As the core of each diffuser <b>224</b> fills with water they will stay on the base of the reactor <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Diffusers may also be provided in pipelines communicating with a reactor, for example those connecting the reactor with others in the reactor system. Alternatively, gas may be introduced at these points by other suitable means. This may be especially applicable in the case of a heap or dump leaching process in which ore particles are not placed into suspension in the leach liquor.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Materials treated by the process and reactor systems of the invention may include ores, concentrates obtained from ores, tailings, wastes and other materials having sufficient metal values present to economically remove the metal or to remove metals detrimental to the environment or other processes. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the treatment of sulphides.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The metal value containing material may require to be pre-treated, for example crushed, to a size sufficiently small to enable it to be ground in conventional comminution equipment such as ball mills.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Conveniently, the solids requiring oxidation are ground to a particle size sufficiently fine for the gas to be effectively used in maintaining a suspension thereof and without allowing significant build-up on the floor of the reactor. Typically, grinding to a suitable particle size distribution is necessary to meet this criterion. The size of the product after grinding is preferably 90% passing 50 microns or less. It is advantageous for the ore or other metal containing material to be ground in an ultra fine grinding machine to particle size between 80% passing 2 microns and 80% passing 30 microns in accordance with a further embodiment of the invention. The bottom particle size is as small a size as is practically attainable by grinding. The size of the particles should be chosen to be the optimum for maintaining the solids in suspension and carrying out a bacterial oxidation process.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Conveniently, after crushing and/or grinding the material concentration may occur by gravity, flotation or other beneficiation processes to increase the proportion of the sulphides or other desired minerals in the product. However, the process is equally applicable to the treatment of concentrates of residue produced by others and comminution pre-treatment is not necessarily required in each case.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The ground metal containing ore or concentrate is preferably slurried with an aqueous solution, especially water. Slurries from grinding may be diluted within additional water and pumped into the reaction zone in which the bio-oxidation process is to take place. The pulp density of the slurry introduced to the reactor of the invention may be of great importance to the attainment of the object of the invention, accordingly a range of 5 to 15% or upward may be selected. At lower pulp density, as stated, efficient bacterial activity may be achieved as toxic effects due to high ionic concentration; and/or mechanical grinding of bacteria are avoided. Leaching is enhanced by the very low shear, low ionic concentration environment. Bacteria are ideally previously added to the reactor in the form of a culture with a mineral and grown in sufficient numbers so that there are preferably between 10<sup>5 </sup>and 10<sup>9 </sup>bacteria per milliliter of slurry. The bacteria may be maintained in the reactor according to accepted practice or by a method of immobilisation.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Preferably the retention time in the reactor is 2 to 8 days. The retention time may be longer to allow treatment of less finely ground material, which requires a longer time to be processed, or to achieve higher levels of mineral oxidation and dissolution of the metal. The amount of gas introduced to the slurry may be changed in accordance with retention time but this is not essential.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Conveniently, the bacterial oxidation process is carried out in an acidic solution which is suitable for growth of the specific bacteria, for example thiobacilli, used. This is expected to be in the range of 0.5 to 3.0. Preferably, the pH will be in the range 0.8 to 2.5. An initial acid addition may be required at the start of the process to neutralise acid consuming minerals and maintain the pH in the required range. The process of oxidising sulphide minerals produces acidic by-products and it is likely that the pH will decrease during processing. If necessary, the pH may be maintained in the required range by controlled addition of a base or basic agent such as lime, limestone or any other suitable alkali.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Where the material to be treated is not a sulphide, reaction may be carried out under alkaline conditions. In these situations the pH is to be kept at a level suitable to the specific leaching conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Support of the bacteria is likely to acquire the addition of nutrients to maintain growth. Typical nutrients to be introduced to the reaction zone are nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus containing materials such as ammonium sulphate, potassium dithiophosphate and magnesium sulphate. In addition, other nutrients may be required for specific ores and concentrates as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, as oxidation of sulphide minerals is an exothermic process, heat will be released during bacterial oxidation. This may be a problem where ores are treated but may be especially true where an enriched sulphide concentrate is treated. In this case, the release of heat may increase the temperature of the slurry in the reactor above that tolerated by the bacteria, especially thiobacilli. <i>Sulpholobus </i>bacteria are more temperature tolerant. Therefore, the reactors are typically to be provided with cooling systems. Water may be a suitable coolant and the cooling system may be direct, with coolant water introduced at the base of the reactor. Alternatively, indirect cooling may be employed using conventional heat exchanger technology. For example, a cooling tower could produce cold water which feeds cooling coils, tube bundles or like means suitably located in the reactor. Tube bundles and coils may be preferred in the absence of strong currents generated by stirring or agitation by turbine blades. Evaporative cooling may be promoted by reducing depth of a reservoir and increasing the surface area. The coolant may be introduced at sufficient velocity to assist in maintaining solids in suspension and admitted water may counteract evaporation losses.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">More generally, a temperature control system with heating/cooling functions may be employed. The location and nature of temperature control system, internal or extemal, direct or indirect, may be varied to achieve the required temperature control of the reactor. For example, when thermophilic bacteria are used, heating to above 60&#xb0; C. may be required.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0078">In accordance with the process and reactor systems of the invention the grade of ore, concentrate or other metal containing material may be lower than that for agitated tanks and like reactor systems because of expected lower capital and operating costs.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0082">A 10% weight percent slurry with a sizing of 90% passing 16 micrometers was maintained in uniform suspension in a tank with fine air bubbles injected from a close packed array of membrane disc diffusers of EPOM synthetic rubber commercially available from Nopol's under the trade mark PIK300. The diameter of the disc is 304 millimeters at the base of a 1.4 meter diameter by 4 meter high tank. The height of tank is similar to that used in commercial practice.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0083">Air flows of at least 2.4 Nm<sup>3</sup>/h/diffuser was required to prevent settling of solids. The air flow rates required were within the manufacturer's recommended operating range.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0084">Solids that settled because of a reduction or disruption in air flow were resuspended when the air flow was re-established at 2.4 Nm<sup>3</sup>/h/diffuser or higher.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0115">In this example, the reactor used was 125 mm diameter and 1.7 m high. A diffuser, as described in Example A, was installed in the base of the reactor. A sample of mixed polymetallic concentrate (designated &#x201c;M2&#x201d;) containing a mixture of mineral sulphides was bio-oxidised to extract zinc, nickel, copper and cobalt. The concentrate contained the nickel mineral pentlandite, as well as nickel contained within the mineral pyrrhotite. Copper was predominately present in the form of chalcopyrite though chalcocite and bomite were also present. Zinc was present as sphalerite. The metal cobalt was associated with the nickel minerals and as the mineral cobalt. The concentrate was ground to a size such that 80% of the particles were less than 15 micrometers in diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0116">The ground concentrate was mixed with water to produce a slurry at 10% solids on a weight to volume basis. Sulphuric acid was added to the slurry to obtain an acidity level of pH 1.2. Approximately half a liter of an inoculum slurry containing a mixture of mineral concentrate and moderately thermophilic bacteria (<i>Thiobacillus ferrooxidans </i>and <i>Thiobacillus thiooxidans</i>) was added to the slurry in the reactor. Thereafter, a mixture of nutrients comprising hydrated magnesium sulphate, potassium orthophosphate, and ammonium sulphate was added to the slurry.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0117">The reactor was then placed in a heated room such that the slurry temperature was maintained at 47&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0118">Air was introduced to the reactor from a standard compressor, through a flowmeter with a flow valve and thence into a pipe connected to the diffuser.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0119">The air flowrate was controlled to allow a steady stream of bubbles to be emitted from the diffuser. The air was used to maintain the particles in suspension and to supply the oxygen requirement of the bacteria. No additional agitation of the reactor was employed. The concentrate was oxidised with metals being released into solution. The level of extraction of the metals was determined by analysing a portion of the liquid fraction of the slurry. When the reaction was complete, the solid and the liquid phases were separated and the solution and the solids analysed.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cork extractor for corks of bottles of champagne, sparkling wine, prosecco, cider or the like, wherein a build-up portion of the cork surrounds the front side of the bottleneck while a driving collar of the cork extractor engages the build-up portion of the cork from beneath for pulling out the cork, wherein the driving collar is liftable by means of an actuating means shaped as a lever or spindle drive in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the bottle relative to an abutment collar supported by the bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cork extractors of this type having a swivel lever are known from U.S. Pat. No. 4,598,613 and EP 0 291 546. EP 0 229 560 A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 2,761,338 describe cork extractors of this type, wherein the actuating means is designed as a thread arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">All known solutions share the disadvantage of either not allowing an attractive design or being difficult to handle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a cork extractor of the type described above which is inexpensive to manufacture, has an attractive design and at the same time is easy to handle so that users having relatively small hands and little force can effortlessly and safely use the corkscrew.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the present invention, this object is achieved by arranging the driving collar on a first half-cylinder shell, forming the abutment collar on a second complementary half-cylinder shell, and providing each of the two half-cylinder shells with a recess, respectively, for the build-up portion of the cork, wherein the driving collar is liftable by means of the actuating means to pull out the cork, wherein during the lifting action the cork is guided along the second half-cylinder shell.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The design according to the present invention provides a symmetrical force distribution so that tilting moments are avoided during handling. The cork is always safely guided and fixed after being pulled out of the bottleneck so as to be easily removable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment of the invention, the actuating means is shaped as a swivel lever, wherein a swivel bearing for the swivel lever is provided at the upper end of each half-cylinder shell so that an inner lever portion of the swivel lever bridges the two swivel bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the corkscrew is made of metal, wherein it is possible to provide the inner side of the swivel lever and/or the outer side of the second half-cylinder shell with a plastic coating or plastic lining.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For securely guiding and gripping the cork head, an engaging collar roughly corresponding to the height of the cork build-up may be formed above the driving collar in such a manner that the cork build-up is arranged between the driving collar and the engaging collar when the cork extractor is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to accomplish a defined guidance during the pulling-out action, a guiding collar may be arranged on the second half-cylinder shell below the abutment collar.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a preferred embodiment, it is envisaged that each swivel bearing comprises a swivel bearing bolt arranged between two fork-like swivel bearing flanges, wherein the swivel bearing flanges are arranged with recesses in the surface of the inner portion of the swivel lever so that the borders of the recesses act as stops for the swivelling motion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Now, the invention will be described in greater detail with respect to a preferred example embodiment with reference to the drawing.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention is concerned with the milking of animals, especially cows.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It has been known for many years to measure and record the quantity of milk obtained from an animal during each milking. It is also well known to analyse the milk quality and/or composition by sensing certain properties of the milk, such as electrical conductivity, somatic cell count, temperature, light absorption or transmission characterics which may be indicative of fat content for example, and protein content. The results of the quantity measurements and analysis of the milk can provide important information about the health and well-being of an animal, and is of valuable assistance to herd management. For example, mastitis and other infections may be detected at an early stage before milk quality become seriously impaired, automatic separation of foremilk can be implemented, the course of the lactation period can be automatically monitored, and appropriate amounts of food and feed concentrates can be calculated to ensure a well balanced diet, all of these factors making important contributions to efficient milk production in terms of yield and quality.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A milk meter currently manufactured and marketed by DeLaval International AB is based on the milk meter described in GB-A-2113856A and includes a metering chamber defined within a measuring container supported by a strain gauge. The chamber has a milk inlet and a milk outlet which is controlled by a valve so that the metering chamber is repeatedly filled and emptied during the milking of an animal. The milk outlet valve is opened when a predetermined amount of milk has collected in the chamber, the predetermined amount being dependent on the rate of milk flow into the metering chamber, and the valve being closed again after a certain time. A container for collecting a sample may be attached to the milk meter to receive a portion of the milk discharged from the metering chamber each time it is emptied. This known milk meter provides an accurate measurement of the milk quantity, but analysis to determine the quality and/or composition of the milk has to be carried out separately on the collected sample after completion of milking.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In U.S. Pat. No. 3,841,756 there is described a milking parlour in which there is provided for each milking stall a milk analysing unit consisting of a container in which all the milk obtained from an animal during a milking is collected and the weight of the milk is measured. Inserted in the container of the analysing unit are a leukocyte sensor and a butterfat sensor, the former sensor having electrodes for sensing the electrical conductivity of the milk, and the latter sensor having an infrared light transmitter and a photocell for measuring the infrared light absorption property of the milk. The results of the quantity, leukocyte content and butterfat content measurements are recorded in the form of a printout. This analysis unit provides information on the milk quality/composition as well as the quantity of milk let down by each animal, but the ability to produce just one set of values for each milking severely limits the extent to which the recorded data can be utilised. In addition to changes which may occur from one milking to the next, variations in milk quality/composition over the course of a single milking can reveal information of valuable significance to herd management decision making. Furthermore, comparison of data obtained for milk collected from respective udder quarters can be helpful also, such as in the detection of subclinical mastitis.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">EP-A-0385539 describes an automatic milking apparatus in which the teat cups are connected to respective milk meters. Each milk meter has a measuring chamber with a milk inlet and a milk outlet controlled by respective valves. The inlet and outlet valves are controlled so that the measuring chamber is repeatedly filled to a predetermined level and emptied, the number of filling and emptying cycles being counted by a computer to determine the quantity of milk obtained from each quarter of the udder of the animal. Each milk meter includes an electrical conductivity sensor for detecting milk effected by mastitis, the computer controlling a valve downstream of the metering chamber so that infected milk discharged from the metering chamber is diverted away from the main milk tank. This arrangement is useful for separating milk of unacceptable quality, but there is no provision for recording data relevant to the milk quality/composition to permit comparison over the course of a milking and from one milking to the next milking.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP-A-0564023 describes a milking plant including milk meters of essentially the same form as described in EP-A-0385539, but there is no conductivity sensor or diverter valve for separating infected milk. Downstream of the milk meter is a sampling device. Filling and emptying the measuring chamber of the milk meter is repeated just a few times during one milking. During at least a selected number of emptying phases a small fraction of the milk discharged from the measuring chamber is diverted to the sampling device so that e.g. about 1% of the milk obtained from the cow is collected in a collecting element. With this arrangement a single sample is collected for a complete milking and it is not possible to compare analysis results for samples taken at particular stages of successive milkings or at different stages of the same milking.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is disclosed in EP-A-0665434 and EP-A-0666475 milking installations in which a milk analyser is located downstream of a milk quantity meter in a milk line between a milk pump and a milk tank. A display screen displays the milk quantity determined by the quantity meter as well as the fat content and the albumin content determined by the milk analyser. This equipment is not able to discriminate between property values relating to milk quality or composition at discrete stages of a milking of a animal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention addresses the shortcomings of the prior art as discussed above and in accordance with one aspect the invention there is provided a method of milking an animal comprising the steps of directing milk collected from the udder of the animal into a metering chamber which is repeatedly filled and emptied during the milking procedure, checking the quality and/or composition of the milk collected in the metering chamber, and counting the number of filling and emptying cycles of the metering chamber, characterised in that during each of at least several cycles of filling and emptying the metering chamber the number of respective filling and emptying cycle is recorded, a milk sample is removed from the metering chamber for analysis, and/or at least one property of the milk in the metering chamber is sensed and recorded, the at least one property including electrical conductivity, a light absorption characteristic, and/or temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Milk samples removed from the metering chamber can be analysed to determine the somatic cell count, fat content, protein content, urea content and or enzyme, for example NAGase (N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase) content.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect the invention provides a milk metering apparatus comprising a metering chamber into which milk from an udder of an animal is delivered in the course of milking the animal, the metering chamber having a milk inlet and a milk outlet for repeated filling and emptying of the metering chamber during the milking procedure, the number of filling and emptying cycles being counted for determination of the milk quantity, and a sampling duct communicating with the interior of the metering chamber for removal of milk samples from the metering chamber during respective filling and emptying cycles. Alternatively or additionally to the sampling duct there is at least one sensor for sensing a property of the milk in the metering chamber, the milk property being electrical conductivity, a light absorption or transmission characteristic, and/or temperature, and recording means which records values of the at least one property sensed for comparison with corresponding sensed and recorded means.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The milk sample can be withdrawn from the metering chamber through a tube, e.g. a suction tube, the tube defining the sampling duct and extending downwardly into the metering chamber. A suction device is preferably connected to the sampling duct and is operable for withdrawing a milk sample through the sampling duct from metering chamber by suction. An analyser may be connected to the sampling duct so that milk samples removed from the metering chamber are delivered directly to the analyser for analysis. Alternatively, a sample collecting device can be connected to the milk sampling duct, milk samples removed from the metering chamber being delivered into sample collection containers for laboratory analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">There can be provided in the metering chamber either instead of or in addition to the sampling tube, at least one sensor for sensing a property of the milk indicative of quality and/or composition, in particular electrical conductivity, a light absorption or transmission characteristic or temperature. Some properties of milk, the temperature for instance, can change quite rapidly after the milk has left the udder and sensing these properties in the metering chamber allows them to be measured and recorded very soon after the milk has been removed from the udder and before significant changes have had time to occur. For sensing electrical conductivity electrodes, e.g. carried on a probe extending into the metering chamber are preferred, and for sensing a light absorption characteristic a sensor comprising a light source, such as light emitting diode, and a light detecting device, such as a photocell, again carried by a probe extending down into the metering chamber, is preferred. Conveniently the electrodes, light source and light detecting device are provided on the same probe which can also incorporate the suction tube for sample removal from the metering chamber. Alternatively two or more probes can be employed, for example, one for each milk property to be sensed in the metering chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The apparatus preferably includes recording means such as a computer for recording the property values obtained from analysis of the milk samples and/or by direct measurement on the milk in the metering chamber, and for recording the number of the filling and emptying cycles during which the respective samples were taken from the metering chamber and/or the milk property values were sensed in the metering chamber. Recorded values relevant to the quality/composition of the milk collected in the metering chamber during a selected filling and emptying cycle can be compared with the corresponding recorded values related to milk collected in the metering chamber during a corresponding filling and emptying cycle during a previous milking of the same animal, and/or with the corresponding recorded values for milk collected in the metering chamber during an earlier filling and emptying cycle during the same milking. Preferably the recording means also records the time of milking and the interval since the immediately preceding milking of the animal. It has been observed that milk property values, such as the electrical conductivity of foremilk and somatic cell count are influenced by the time interval that has elapsed between a milking and the immediately preceding milking.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is preferable that the number of filling and emptying cycles of the metering chamber per milking is relatively large and is appropriate, therefore, that the emptying of the metering chamber is initiated in response to a predetermined amount of milk not more than about one liter or about 0.5 kg, more especially 0.2 liters or 0.1 kg, having collected in the metering chamber. The emptying of the metering chamber is suitably commenced when the amount of milk collected therein reaches a value in the range of 20 g to 400 g, more particularly 50 g to 150 g, the metering chamber having a milk collecting capacity in the same range. This means that for a typical cow the number of filling and emptying cycles for milking can be more than 100, for example 150 to 250. Emptying can be commenced in response to different predetermined amounts of milk being collected dependent on the milk flow rate into the metering chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With the metering chamber having a relatively small capacity in relation to the total quantity of milk for one milking so that the metering chamber is filled and emptied many times during one milking, a large amount of data can be collected from the samples taken and/or measurements made by means of the sensors located in the metering chamber and it can also be recorded at which time, or the stage in the course of milking, i.e. during which filling and emptying cycle, each analysed sample was taken and/or the respective readings were taken by means of the sensors. It is possible for a sample to be taken and/or milk property values to be sensed and recorded during each and every filling and emptying cycle of the metering chamber to maximise the data collection. This can allow all the samples to be collected and mixed to provide a complete sample for the milking of the animal that is proportional and truly representative of all the milk collected and measured in the metering chamber during that milking. If preferred the analysis can be performed on the complete mixed sample. However, it may be sufficient for samples to be taken and/or milk property values to be sensed by the sensors and recorded by the recording means less often, such as every other filling and emptying cycle, possibly once in every four filling and emptying cycles, or perhaps once in every ten filling and emptying cycles. Control means which controls the sample taking and/or sensing and recording of milk property values may be programmable to permit selection of the frequency of sample taking and/or property value sensing and recording according to requirements. Alternatively the frequency of the filling and emptying cycles during which a milk sample is taken and/or property values are sensed and recorded can be selected automatically, such as in dependence upon the results of the analysis of a sample taken from the metering chamber and/or the milk property values sensed and recorded either during a previous milking of the animal, or during the same milking procedure, in particular during the early stages of the milking procedure. Increasing the frequency at which samples are taken and/or property values are sensed, such as in response to unexpected measurement values are due to an isolated event or are indicative of a trend. In addition it is possible for samples to be taken and/or property value readings to be performed more than once during a filling or emptying cycle and/or for it to be selected at which specific time or times it is done during the filling and emptying cycle. It is also possible for the frequency of sample taking and/or property value sensing and recording to be changed during the course of the milking so that, for example, the sample taking and/or data recording may be performed more frequently during an initial part of the milking period than during a subsequent part of the milking period or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a particularly expedient embodiment the metering chamber is defined within a measuring container supported by a weighing device, specifically a strain gauge device, and means are provided to cause a milk sample to be removed from the metering chamber in response to a signal from the weighing device. With such an arrangement it can easily be assured that samples are taken at a set point during the filling and emptying cycles, that is when a certain amount of milk has been collected in the metering chamber. It is also possible for sample to be taken at two or more specific times during a filling phase, for example at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the filling phase as determined by the strain gauge.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although the milk collected from all the teats of the animal, that is from all four udder quarters in the case of an animal having four teats, such as a cow, can be directed into the metering chamber, it is preferable for each teat cup to be connected to a respective metering chamber, so that the quantity of milk produced by each udder quarter is separately recorded, and data relating to the milk quality/composition is also recorded separately for each quarter. Comparing milk data relating to different quarters of the same animal can be useful in identifying at an early stage physiological changes occurring in one quarter, such as the onset of mastitis.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The milk meter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is basically the same as the DeLaval milk meter MM15 currently manufactured and sold by DeLaval International AB. It comprises a casing <b>1</b> with a milk inlet <b>2</b> for connection of a milk tube attached to a teat cup, and a milk outlet <b>3</b> for connection to a milk line e.g. leading to a milk tank or optionally to a waste tank for collection of milk not intended for consumption. Located within the casing <b>1</b> and supported by an arm <b>4</b> fastened to strain gauge <b>5</b> is a measuring container <b>6</b> in which there is defined a metering chamber <b>7</b>. The container <b>6</b> has an open top forming a milk inlet, and an outlet opening at the bottom controlled by a valve <b>8</b> which is coupled to a valve actuator <b>9</b> by an arm <b>10</b>. A stationary baffle member <b>11</b>, supported from the casing <b>1</b>, is positioned within the measuring chamber <b>7</b> to ensure gentle flow of milk into the metering chamber so as not to disrupt the metering function. The control electronics associated with the strain gauge continuously registers the weight of milk in the metering chamber and when it reaches a predetermined amount, e.g. 90, 70 or 60 grms depending upon the milk flow rate, the valve actuator <b>9</b> is activated to open the outlet valve <b>8</b> so that the milk is emptied out of the metering chamber <b>7</b>. After a certain time has elapsed, e.g. 0.5 sec to 2.5 sec depending on the milk flow rate, the valve is closed again and refilling of the metering chamber commences. The cycle of filling and emptying the measuring chamber is repeated many times, in particular around 100 to 200 times, during a single milking procedure for one animal. The exact number of filling and emptying cycles of course depends on the quantity of milk obtained from the animal. The control unit measures the weight of milk collecting during each filling phase of the metering chamber, and based on the rate of increase in weight during filling calculates the weight of milk which flows into the metering chamber during each emptying phase, and the total quantity of milk is recorded by the control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with the present invention a probe <b>15</b> extends through the cover of the casing <b>1</b> and down into the metering chamber <b>7</b>, the probe terminating near the bottom of the measuring container <b>6</b>. At its lower end the probe <b>15</b> carries two sensors <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, namely one sensor comprising a pair of electrodes for sensing the electrical conductivity of the milk, and a second sensor having a light emitting diode and a photocell for sensing the light absorption characteristic of the milk in the metering chamber. Electric leads connected to the sensors extend along the probe <b>15</b>, as does a tube <b>18</b> defining a sampling duct for removing small samples from the metering chamber <b>7</b>. Other forms of sensor, such as a temperature sensor can be provided on the probe in addition to or in place of the conductivity and light absorption sensors described. The sampling tube takes form of a pipette or suction tube <b>18</b> and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is connected through a sampling pump <b>19</b> to a milk analyser <b>20</b>. The analyser <b>20</b> performs an analysis of the milk composition, e.g. to determine fat and/or protein content or the presence of other constituents, and either records the results of the analysis or transmits this data to a separate recording device, such as a computer. The milk analyser or computer also records the results of conductivity and light adsorption measurements carried out using the sensors <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> carried by the probe <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As already described, during the milking of an animal, the metering chamber <b>7</b> is repeatedly filled and emptied. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the sequence of steps conducted for sensing and recording data relating to the milk passing through the milk meter during each of the filling and emptying cycles. At the end of an emptying phase the control unit produces a signal to cause the valve actuator <b>9</b> to close the outlet valve <b>8</b> as indicated by step <b>30</b>. The conductivity sensor is employed to check whether a conductivity measurement is possible and hence determine whether sufficient milk has collected in the metering chamber to immerse the lower end of the probe <b>15</b>, an attempt to make conductivity measurement being made in step <b>31</b> and in step <b>32</b> it being checked whether the measurement has been successful. Steps <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are repeated until it is confirmed that the conductivity measurement succeeded and the control sequence then advances to step <b>33</b> whereat the conductivity measurement is recorded, the light absorption characteristic is sensed and recorded, the number of the filling cycle is recorded, the time is recorded, and the sampling pump <b>19</b> is actuated to remove a milk sample from the metering chamber via the sampling tube <b>18</b>, which sample is passed to the analyser <b>20</b> for analysis. In step <b>34</b> it is checked whether the predetermined weight of milk has been collected in the metering chamber <b>7</b>, this being done repeatedly until the question is answered positively when, in step <b>35</b>, the valve actuator <b>9</b> is operated to open the valve <b>8</b> to initiate the next emptying phase. The control cycle is then repeated and continues until the teat cup is detached from the teat of the animal and flow of milk into the milk meter ceases.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an arrangement in which three milk property sensors carried by probes <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>and <b>15</b><i>c </i>are positioned within the metering chamber <b>7</b>, the sensors being a conductivity sensor <b>16</b> comprising electrodes, a light absorption sensor <b>17</b> comprising a light emitting diode and photocell, and a temperature sensor <b>22</b>. Although the sensors are shown mounted on respective probes, two or more sensors can of course be provided on a common probe. The sensors are respectively connected to a control device <b>23</b> which is connected in turn to a recording device <b>24</b> for the output sensors to be transmitted to the control device and the measured values to be recorded by the recording device. The control device <b>23</b> and recording device <b>24</b> are conveniently combined in a common control and recording unit which may be a computer and preferably has the additional capability to compare recorded values measured by means of the sensors <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>22</b> under the control of the control device. The control device also has a connection <b>25</b> with the milk meter for the sensor readings to be coordinated with the filling and emptying cycles of the metering chamber <b>7</b>. The control and recording unit can also serve to register and record the milk quantity determined by means of the milk meter. The arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be used with or without a milk sampling arrangement such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The same operational sequence as that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be followed except of course that there may not be any sample taking, but there will be temperature readings taken at each step <b>33</b> during the filling and emptying cycles of the metering chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Other structural and control arrangements are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the milk samples may be delivered to a sample collecting device arranged to collect them in tubes, phials or other suitable containers which can be provided within a cassette for transportation to a laboratory for analysis of the milk samples. Also, the taking of conductivity and/or light absorption measurements and/or the removal of samples from the metering chamber can be triggered by the control means in response to the strain gauge output signalling that a predetermined weight of milk has collected in the metering chamber <b>7</b>. The latter control technique can reliably assure that data readings and/or samples are always taken at a certain defined point in the filing phase, or indeed at two or more defined points during the filling phase.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, measurements and/or samples may be taken near the beginning, at the middle and/or at the end of the filling phase as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">From the foregoing description it will be understood that the invention allows extensive data to be collected over the course of a single milking. The recorded data can be compared with corresponding data from other milkings to help recognition of trends and changes which may assist herd management decisions about special treatment of individual animals and appropriate feeding levels. In addition, data collected during different filling and emptying cycles of the same milking procedure can be compared, which may be utilised, for example, for separation of foremilk. The recorded data related to milk obtained from respective udder quarters can also be compared and this may be useful for identification of subclinical mastitis or other conditions which may require treatment. It has been observed that some properties of milk, including conductivity and somatic cell count, are influenced by the time interval between successive milkings and for this reason the recording equipment is preferably adapted to record the time of milking and to calculate the interval since the immediately preceding milking of the same animal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Some comparisons of data as described above can be performed automatically and the control equipment can be used to generate a signal to alert the farmer to a particular situation which requires attention e.g. as regards the health and well being of a particular animal. Furthermore, a screen may be provided for displaying recorded data and possible data comparisons to the farmer.</p>

Air for the auxiliary injector (<b>38</b>) is sourced from outside of the first combustion chamber (<b>20</b>), i.e. typically via a compressor or in a multi-cylinder engine one of the engine cylinders could be devoted to this task. As a piston (<b>14</b>) in a cylinder (<b>12</b>) of the engine (<b>10</b>) approaches top dead center during its compression stroke, fuel and air is injected into the auxiliary chamber (<b>30</b>), and the valve (<b>34</b>) is held in the extended position. A spark is delivered to the auxiliary combustion chamber causing ignition of the fuel and air mixture there within. Just prior to the piston (<b>14</b>) reaching top dead center, a valve controller (<b>36</b>) operates the valve (<b>34</b>) to move it to its retracted position whereby the ignited fuel and air from the auxiliary combustion chamber passes through the passage (<b>32</b>) into the first combustion chamber (<b>20</b>). At approximately top dead center the fuel injector (<b>24</b>) injects the first volume of fuel into the combustion chamber (<b>20</b>) which is very rapidly vaporised and combusted by the ignited fuel and air from the auxiliary combustion chamber (<b>30</b>).</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine with a divided combustion chamber, and in particular, to an internal combustion chamber having a first or main combustion chamber and an auxiliary combustion chamber.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Divided internal combustion chamber engines having a main combustion chamber and an auxiliary combustion chamber are well known. In such engines, communication is provided at selected times between the main combustion chamber and the auxiliary combustion chamber in order to firstly inject compressed air from the main combustion chamber (during the compression stroke) into the auxiliary chamber, and then at approximately top dead centre, after ignition of fuel and the compressed air within the auxiliary chamber, allowing combustion products to flow from the auxiliary chamber into the main chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This control of fluid communication has been effected by the use of a valve known as a &#x201c;flow modulator&#x201d;. Typically the valve terminates the injection of compressed air from the main combustion chamber into the auxiliary chamber at about 25&#xb0; before top dead centre. By terminating the flow of compressed air a this time, the compression ratio in the auxiliary chamber is limited to around 9:1, which is considered ideal for spark ignition. A dedicated fuel injector is provided to inject a small volume of fuel into the auxiliary chamber to be mixed with the compressed air within the auxiliary chamber in an amount to provide a slightly rich mixture</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">At top dead centre the compression within the main chamber would reach a pressure in excess of 300 psi. However a spark plug in communication with the auxiliary chamber is timed to produce a spark shortly after 25&#xb0; before top dead centre so that the air and fuel within the auxiliary chamber has been combusting for slightly less than the time required for the engine to turn from 25&#xb0; before top dead centre to top dead centre. As a result the pressure within the auxiliary chamber is substantially above the pressure within the main combustion chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">At top dead centre, the valve opens so that the combustion products within the auxiliary chamber are energetically ejected into the main combustion chamber to initiate combustion of the fuel/air mixture therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide an alternate form of an internal combustion engine with a divided combustion chamber.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0026">Referring to the accompanying drawing, an internal combustion engine <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention includes a cavity in the form of a cylinder <b>12</b> which houses moveable body in the form of a reciprocating piston <b>14</b>. The cylinder <b>12</b> is defined by the combination of an engine block <b>16</b> and cylinder head <b>18</b> both of generally conventional construction. A first or main combustion chamber <b>20</b> is formed between an upper surface <b>22</b> of the cylinder head <b>18</b> and the piston <b>14</b>. A first fuel injector <b>24</b> is mounted in the cylinder head <b>18</b> with its discharge nozzle <b>26</b> positioned so as to inject a first volume of fuel into the combustion chamber <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0027">A removable/replaceable housing <b>28</b> which defines an auxiliary or second combustion chamber <b>30</b> is threadingly and sealingly coupled to the head <b>18</b> of the engine <b>10</b>. The housing <b>28</b> is further provided with a passage <b>32</b> which extends from the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> to the first combustion chamber <b>20</b>. Fluid communication through the passage <b>32</b> between the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> and the first combustion chamber <b>20</b> is controlled by a valve <b>34</b>. In particular, the valve <b>34</b> is moveable under the influence of a valve controller <b>36</b> between an extended position where the valve <b>34</b> provides high impedance to the flow of fluid from the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> to the first combustion chamber <b>20</b>, and a retracted position where the valve <b>34</b> provides substantially unimpeded fluid flow between the chambers <b>30</b> and <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0028">An auxiliary fuel and air injector <b>38</b> is threadingly and sealing coupled to the housing <b>28</b> and positioned so as to inject air and fuel into the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b>. As explained in eater detail below, the air injected into the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> by the fuel and air injector <b>38</b> is sourced from outside of the cylinder <b>12</b>. An ignition means in the form of a spark plug <b>40</b> is also threadingly engaged with the housing <b>28</b> at a location so that a spark produced by the spark plug <b>40</b> is able to ignite the fuel and air mixture within the auxiliary camber <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0029">The controller <b>36</b> controls the engine <b>10</b> in a manner so that the fuel and air mixture injected by the injector <b>38</b> into the combustion chamber <b>30</b> is ignited by a spark from the spark plug <b>40</b> when the valve <b>34</b> is in the extended position, ie providing a high impedance to fluid flow, and prior to the piston <b>14</b> reaching top dead centre. The controller <b>36</b> further operates to move the valve <b>34</b> to the retracted position at a subsequent time so that the ignited fuel and air mixture within the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> can flow through the passage <b>32</b> into the combustion chamber <b>20</b> where it can then react with fuel injected by the injector <b>24</b> and air within the chamber <b>20</b> to effect further combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0030">Looking at the engine in more detail, the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> is of generally annular shape with the valve <b>34</b> having a member <b>35</b> extending through the centre of the annulus. The valve <b>34</b> is provided with a reduced diameter end <b>42</b> of a shape and configuration substantially complimentary to the shape of a throat portion <b>44</b> of the passage <b>32</b> at the end adjacent the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b>. Ideally, the valve <b>34</b> is shaped and configured, and controlled by the controller <b>36</b> in a way so that it does not contact the throat <b>44</b> or the passage <b>32</b> of the housing <b>28</b>. In this way, the valve <b>34</b>, and <b>42</b>, throat <b>44</b> and passage <b>32</b> are not subject to impact wear. The function of the valve <b>34</b> is not to provide a complete airtight seal between the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> and the first combustion chamber <b>20</b> but rather to provide a high impedance to the flow of air between the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> and the first combustion chamber <b>20</b>. This high impedance is required during the compression stroke of the engine so as to allow substantially independent control of the air pressure within the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b>. In the absence of the valve <b>34</b>, air pressure within the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> would be the same as that in the main combustion chamber <b>22</b> through the entirety of the stroke of the piston <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0031">Typically, air injected by the fuel and air injector <b>38</b> is supplied by an engine driven compressor or similar device. This air is mixed with a metered amount of fuel to provide a fuel/air mixture of a predetermined ratio which is then injected by the auxiliary fuel and air injector <b>38</b> into the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b>. The particular ratio of fuel and air injected can be controlled by known means.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0032">As the air injected by the fuel and air injector <b>38</b> is sourced from outside of the cylinder <b>12</b>, the injection of fuel and air into the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> is independent of the timing of the piston <b>14</b>. Accordingly, fuel and air may be injected via the injector <b>38</b> into the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> immediately after the valve <b>34</b> has been moved to the extended position, for example when the piston <b>14</b> has completed its exhaust stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0033">The effective combustion chamber of the engine <b>10</b> is a divided combustion chamber engine because it includes the combination of the first combustion chamber <b>20</b>, the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> and the passage <b>32</b>. The main combustion chamber <b>20</b> for each cylinder <b>12</b> of the engine <b>10</b> is formed by the volume defined between the cylinder head <b>12</b>, upper surface <b>46</b> of the piston <b>14</b> and circumferential surface <b>48</b> of the engine block <b>16</b> above the surface <b>46</b>. Of course, when the piston <b>14</b> is at top dead centre, this volume is at a minimum with the upper surface <b>46</b> of the piston <b>14</b> typically disposed above the circumferential surface <b>48</b> of the cylinder bore. The upper surface <b>46</b> with the piston <b>14</b> is provided with a concave recess or depression <b>50</b>. To assist in the combustion process, the first fuel injector <b>24</b> and the housing <b>28</b> are relatively juxtaposed so that fuel injected from nozzle <b>26</b> of injector <b>24</b>, and combustion products from the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> passing through the passage <b>32</b> are focused or targeted at the same point <b>52</b> in the recess <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0034">The controller <b>36</b> is ideally a solenoid or other electrical/electronic controller so that the movement of the valve <b>34</b> can be controlled electronically so as to allow adaptive software control of the position of the valve <b>34</b>. Although, it is further envisaged that the controller <b>36</b> may be in the form of a mechanical linkage allowing the position of the valve <b>34</b> to be controlled by a camshaft timing belt or other mechanical means.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0035">The operation of the engine <b>10</b> will now be described. It is, however, to be understood that the engine <b>10</b> will consist of additional components to those described above such as crank shaft, inlet valves, outlet valves, camshafts, radiators, cooling jackets, fuel pumps etc. Such components can take any known form and do not constitute in part or any combination part of the present inventive concept. Further, while the above description is in relation to a single cylinder only, it is to be understood the engine <b>10</b> is most likely to include a plurality of identical cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0036">Assume that the piston <b>14</b> is at bottom dead centre and commencing its compression stroke. The controller <b>36</b> operates to maintain the valve <b>34</b> in its extended position so as to provide high impedance to the flow of fluid through the throat <b>44</b> between the first combustion chamber <b>20</b> and the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b>. As the piston <b>14</b> commences to move towards top dead centre, the volume of the combustion chamber <b>20</b> deceases and air in the combustion chamber <b>20</b> inducted during a previous induction stroke is progressively compressed. At any desired time controlled by an engine management system (not shown) of the engine <b>10</b> and which may also control the controller <b>36</b>, a predetermined volume of air and fuel is injected via the auxiliary injector <b>38</b> into the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b>. Since the valve <b>34</b> is in the extended position, there is very high fluid flow impedance between the combustion chamber <b>20</b> and the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> thus resulting in a substantial independence of pressure between the two chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0037">At a further desired moment thereafter, prior to the piston <b>14</b> reaching top dead centre, the spark plug <b>40</b> is operated to produce a spark which initiates combustion of the fuel and air within the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b>. As the valve <b>34</b> is maintained at this time in the extended position, pressure within the chamber <b>30</b> rises very rapidly to its maximum pressure due to the combustion of the fuel therewithin. Further, as a result of the small size and volume of the chamber <b>30</b>, flame propagation is very rapid.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0038">At a desired moment, for example when the piston <b>14</b> has reached top dead centre, the controller <b>36</b> is operated to rapidly move the valve <b>34</b> to its retracted position allowing substantially unobstructed fluid communication between the auxiliary combustion camber <b>30</b> and the first combustion chamber <b>20</b>. Although pressure within the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> prior to the commencement of the combustion of the fuel therewithin may have been lower than maximum pressure achieved in the main chamber <b>20</b> when the piston <b>14</b> is at top dead centre, due to the combustion of fuel and air within the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b>, pressure within the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> is substantially higher than the chamber <b>20</b> when the valve <b>34</b> is moved to the retracted position. Consequently, burning air and fuel and the resulting combustion products move at high speed through the throat <b>44</b> and passage <b>32</b> into the combustion chamber <b>20</b>. The rapid flow through the passage <b>32</b> ensures a thorough mixture of the burning fuel and air from the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> with the air within the first chamber <b>20</b>. Fuel is now injected via the first fuel injector <b>24</b> into the first combustion chamber <b>20</b>. The high velocity of burning fuel and air passing through the passage <b>32</b> due to the high pressure differential between the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> and the combustion chamber <b>20</b>; together with the presence of already burning fuel from the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> ensures that the fuel injected by the first injector <b>24</b> is very rapidly vaporised and combusted. Further, as previously described, the fuel injected via the first injector <b>24</b> and the burning air and fuel passing through passage <b>32</b> are directed to the same point <b>52</b> on the recess <b>50</b>. This further assists in the mixing process within the first chamber <b>20</b> to further aid the combustion process. After completion of the exhaust stroke, when the cylinder pressure relates to only the relatively low exhaust back pressure, the controller <b>36</b> is operated to remove the valve <b>34</b> back to the extended position so as to provide high fluid flow impedance between the first chamber <b>20</b> and the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b>. The auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> is now ready to receive a further injection of air and fuel in preparation for the next engine/piston cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0039">It would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that by sourcing the air for the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> from outside of the cylinder <b>12</b>, ie by a compressor, embodiments of the present invention allow a substantial increase in the amount of time available for preparation of optimum conditions within the auxiliary combustion chamber <b>30</b> for fuel ignition. This is of substantial benefit when using fuels of lower volatility (ie lower grade fuels) as sufficient time can be provided to ensure that the fuel injected into the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> is completed vaporised prior to ignition and further, is at an optimal pressure for ignition of the fuel. Further, the creation of auxiliary combustion within the chamber <b>30</b> produces very high thermal and kinetic energy levels which can be timed independent of the position of the piston <b>14</b> and thus timed for release into the first combustion camber <b>20</b> to produce the most effective and efficient combustion of the fuel injected into the first combustion chamber <b>20</b>. It is envisaged that embodiments of this invention are able to avoid the normal detrimental high peak pressure problems created by ignition delay phenomena which hitherto has proven to be an unavoidable characterization with the use of diesel cycle methods and all late direct injection engines.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0040">As the total combustion process is not strictly governed by the action of the piston <b>14</b> and the critical functions required in preparation for combustion are conducted in isolation, embodiments of the present invention can provide a timeframe approximately 24 times longer than conventional engines to fit with the chemical requirements for optimum combustion. Along with this, it can be shown mathematically that the combined energies released by the auxiliary chamber is at least one thousand fold greater than that of a spark plug. As a consequence of the unique way the embodiments of the present invention operate, the main combustion can now take place effectively, just as the main chamber starts to expand following the compression stroke, thus helping to reduce the peak combustion pressure and direct heat loss and ensuring significant advantages in reducing the formation of NOx emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0041">Now that an embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail it will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts that numerous modifications and variations may be made without departing from the basic inventive concepts. For example, prior to the valve <b>34</b> retracting, the main fuel injector could be operated to inject fuel into the main combustion chamber <b>20</b> thereby providing a ready mixture of air and vaporised fuel to be ignited when the valve <b>34</b> retracts. Further, the valve <b>34</b> could be retracted either immediately after combustion has started within the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> and if the fuel has been injected and thoroughly mixed in the first combustion chamber <b>20</b>, more conventional flame propagation methods can be used under the same engine conditions. It is further envisaged that control of when fuel is injected into the main chamber <b>20</b> via the first injector <b>24</b> can be controlled by any conventional fuel pump. In addition, whether the valve <b>34</b> opens almost simultaneously with combustion starting in the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> and is ejected at a low pressure differential, or whether there is a higher pressure differential in the auxiliary chamber prior to the valve <b>34</b> opening may be controlled by the timing of the spark, using a shaft encoder and microprocessor techniques. The fuel/air ratio within the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> and the first chamber <b>20</b> may also be controlled by conventional methods. Finally, the auxiliary chamber <b>30</b> may be supplied with a rich fuel/air mixture via the injector <b>38</b>. When the valve <b>34</b> retracted there would be some partially combusted materials passing into the main chamber <b>20</b> whereupon the presence of the additional air allows completion of the combustion, and ideal conditions to immediately combust injecting main fuel. Further, while the present embodiment has been described in application to a reciprocating piston engine it may also be applied to other types of combustion engines such as, for example, a rotary (eg, Wankel) engine. In such an embodiment the cavity defined by the housing of the rotary engine is equivalent to he cylinder <b>12</b> of the present embodiment and the rotor equivalent to the piston <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0042">All such modifications and variations together with others that would be apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention the nature of which is to be determined from the above description and the appended claims.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and apparatus for interconnecting an electronic module to a substrate through resilient wire conductors in an interposer arrangement. A carrier layer of insulating material with an array of apertures, arranged to align with both the electrical pads on an electronic module and electrical contacts on a substrate, each hold, for example, a resilient wadded wire connector. Each connector extends through the aperture provided and beyond the upper and lower surfaces of the carrier layer. Each resilient wadded wire connector and aperture is encapsulated with a elastomeric insulating material sufficiently deformable so as to allow said resilient wadded wire connector to deform upon application of a normal force from each side tending to depress the connector into its aperture. The encapsulation prevents loss or smear of a wadded wire connector when handling.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to electronic packaging. More particularly, the present invention relates to electronic interposers used in electronic packaging to make electrical connection of electronic modules to printed wiring boards, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background and Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Compression connectors, such as those employed in land grid array (LGA) connections, are well known in the art. Typical LGA compression connections employ an interposer to connect a single chip or multiple chip module (MCM) to a printed wiring board (PWB). The MCM generally comprises multiple integrated circuits or chips assembled into a subsystem the size of traditional single chip packages. The single chip or MCM may be connected to the PWB through the interposer with the chip module circuit pads making contact with the array of connection points extending from one surface of the interposer and the PWB circuit pads making contact with the array of connections extending from the other surface of the interposer. Compression forces are employed to hold the chip module and PWB against the interposer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various forms of interposers have been designed to facilitate the LGA connection of the single chip or MCM to the PWB. One of the considerations in designing interposers is to create a structure that will accommodate the thermal mismatch between chip module and PWB. Another consideration in designing interposers is to create a structure that will accommodate differences in topography between the mating surface profiles and mating conductor of the chip module and PWB.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Interposer layers of both substantially rigid and relatively resilient insulating materials have been employed for this purpose. In using such materials, a variety of conductor interconnect structures have been employed in the prior art to electrically connect the contacts or pads on one surface of the interposer to the corresponding contacts or pads on the other surface of the interposer. One form of conductor interconnect structure employed is designed to be resilient or deformable. As such, the deformable conductor can move to accommodate, for example, the CTE dimensional mismatch between the chip module and PWB.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One example of a resilient or deformable conductor used in rigid or semi-rigid layers of insulating material is the resilient wadded-wire connector, sometimes also known as the &#x201c;fuzz-button&#x201d; type connector or the connector made by CINCH Connectors, Inc. under the trademark CIN::APSE. An example of such type of connector is found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,386,890. The interposer in such arrangements typically comprises a substantially rigid interposer layer of plastic having a plurality or array of apertures with each aperture further having disposed thereon a deformable, randomly configured, resilient conductor material for connecting a MCM, for example, to a PWB. The resilient conductors of wadded wire are typically held by friction within a plastic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such wadded-wire button or connector arrangements have proven to be reliable once assembled but have been found somewhat difficult to handle beforehand without causing damage to, or displacement of, the wadded-wire button connector. Contact with the wadded-wire button connectors in handling may result in missing button connectors or pulled/smeared button connectors. Since the connectors are typically retained in the interposer layer by friction, they are prone to being pushed or pulled from position. In addition, handling may result in smearing a button connector wherein handling contact with the connector causes a portion of the wadded-wire to become unwadded and free of the aperture wherein it may extend across the surface of the interposer material and short to the wadded-wire button connector of an adjacent aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an example of a typical wadded-wire button connector arrangement which, as can be seen, is randomly wound. An array of nine such connectors is shown to illustrate the connector arrangement but it is understood that, in practice, the array of connectors would typically be made much greater. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, wadded-wire connectors <b>1</b> are held by friction in apertures <b>3</b> in insulating layer <b>5</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the wire of button connector <b>1</b> has been smeared to unwind portion <b>7</b> such that it could short to an adjacent wadded wire button connector.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an improved electronic package.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved method and apparatus for connecting an electronic module to a substrate therefor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide an improved interposer structure for connecting an electronic module to a substrate, such as, a PWB.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is yet still a further object of the present invention to provide a resilient wadded-wire button connector interposer structure with the connectors encapsulated within a compliant or deformable elastomeric insulator material to thereby increase reliability of the interposer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is another object of the present invention to provide a rigid/semi-rigid or resilient interposer insulating layer with an array of apertures containing wadded-wire connectors encapsulated with a compliant elastomeric insulating material sufficient to retain and contain the wound wadded-wire but yet which elastomeric may be sufficiently soft to deform and allow the wadded-wire to protrude therethrough under compression between electronic module and substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an improved LGA connector for connecting an electronic module, such as a single chip or MCM module, to a substrate, such as a PWB. The LGA connector comprises at least one carrier layer of dielectric insulating material having an array of apertures each holding randomly wound wadded-wire connectors. The connectors are encapsulated with a compliant eleastomeric material, preferably having a relatively low modulus, to retain and contain the wadded wire so as to protect the wires from being pulled or lost. The elastomeric material may be sufficiently soft so that the wadded-wire member protrudes through the elastomeric material during activation of the compressive force used to make a compression-type connection of the electronic module to the substrate. Alternatively, a laser or the like may be employed to oblate the elastomeric material in the contact region to expose the wadded wire.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The carrier layer of insulating material may comprise material that is a rigid/semi-rigid insulator or a flexible insulator. Multiple layers of combinations of such material may also be employed. Instead of randomly wound wadded-wire, a tubular wire structure may be used for the conducting member. In such an arrangement, the tube would preferably be oriented on its side with the plane of the wire loops leaning somewhat to provide a linear force versus deflection characteristic.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference to the prior art arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, as hereinabove described, handling of the insulating carrier layer with wadded-wire connectors exposed, as shown, may result in loss of the complete connector or the smearing of connectors, as shown by wire lead portion <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Handling may occur, for example, in the assembly process of connecting the electronic module to a PWB, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows one arrangement for encapsulating randomly wound wadded-wire connectors. In this arrangement, a conventional plastic rigid/semi-rigid insulating carrier layer <b>25</b>A, is configured, for example, as generally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A&#x2013;1B</figref>, with an array of apertures holding wadded-wire connectors. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the connectors are overmolded with an elastomeric polymer material <b>29</b>A so as to encapsulate wadded-wire connectors <b>21</b>A. This may be done in a manner so as to leave the contact tips of wire loops and leads of connectors <b>21</b>A exposed. Alternatively, encapsulating material covering the contact tips of wire loops and leads may be laser ablated, for example to expose the contact tips.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The elastomeric polymer encapsulating material may be any of a variety of elastomeric polymer materials. For example, the encapsulating polymer material may be an elastomeric silicone, such as, SYLGARD No. 182 made by Dow Corning or an elastomeric epoxy, such as, Epo-Tek No. 310 made by Epoxy Technology. The elastomeric encapsulating material may also be sufficiently thin, soft and deformable so as to allow the contact tips of the wadded-wire connectors to punch through the material and thereby expose the contact tips. As can be seen, the contact tips are thus the loops and leads of the wadded-wire at the interface surfaces to the electronic module and substrate, respectively. The modulus of each elastomeric material would typically be less than 5000 psi and, preferably, less than 2000 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The rigid/semi-rigid insulating carrier layers <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> may be made of, for example, liquid crystal polymer materials, such as, VECTRA's No. A 130 liquid crystal polymer material. Alternatively, nylon or polyphenylene sulfides, such as, RYTON (Phillips 66), or polycarbonates, such as LEXAN, (GE) may be used. The range of modulus for such materials is 377,000 psi to 2,175,000 psi. The wadded-wire connectors are typically randomly wound wadded resilient wire made of molybdenum, beryllium-copper or other electrically conductive metallic member.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The encapsulated wadded-wire conductor arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> may be fabricated using the mold arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A&#x2013;5C</figref>. The top half of the mold block <b>52</b>A is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Apertures <b>53</b>A in block <b>52</b>A provide space to encapsulate the top portion of the wadded-wire that extend from the surface of the insulating carrier layer. Although only nine apertures are shown for illustrative purposes, it is clear that in practice, there would be a large number of apertures arrayed in block <b>52</b>A. The recessed region <b>58</b>A provides the mold throat/mold layer area where liquid mold material is poured in to form elastomeric polymer encapsulated wadded-wire connectors that extend from a layer of elastomeric polymer material. It is clear that the thickness of the layer of elastomeric polymer material is determined by the depth of recessed region <b>58</b>A. This layer is shown as layer <b>27</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, and the thickness of the layer is selected in accordance with design choice. Apertures <b>54</b>A provide alignment holes for alignment pins.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a similar mold block configuration for the bottom half of mold <b>52</b>B. However, in the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, mold block <b>52</b>B comprises a split mold block. Mold block <b>52</b>B is split along line <b>56</b>B with bottom portion <b>59</b>B being removable. As shown, block line <b>56</b>B rises in the mid-section in the area of the apertures <b>53</b>B to reduce and define the depth of the aperture array in the upper portion <b>50</b>B of block <b>52</b>B. In this regard, the aperture or cavity walls of apertures <b>53</b>B may be vertical or tapered. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A&#x2013;C</figref> show tapered walls. It is clear that whichever wall configuration is used, the aperture wall configuration would be the same in both the top half mold block <b>52</b>A, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and bottom half mold block <b>52</b>B, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should be understood that bottom portion <b>59</b>B of mold block <b>52</b>B is removable to facilitate removal of the cast part. Thus, with removal of bottom portion <b>59</b>B of mold block <b>52</b>B, the cast part may be pushed out without damage. After removal of the cast part from mold block <b>52</b>B, the upper half mold block <b>52</b>A may be readily removed from the cast part. It is clear, however, that both mold block <b>52</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and mold block <b>52</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> may be split mold blocks, similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is also clear that removable portion, such as bottom portion <b>59</b>B of mold block <b>52</b>B, may be used to facilitate assembly of parts before casting. Thus, after separating the removable bottom portion <b>59</b>B from block <b>52</b>B, wadded wire buttons may be inserted into the cavities <b>53</b>B from below, through apertures in the insulating carrier layer and into the cavities <b>53</b>A of the upper block half <b>52</b>A. This can be seen more clearly with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the top half of the mold shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is positioned on the bottom half of the mold shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Pins in alignment holes <b>54</b>A and <b>54</b>B act to position and align the mold halves. Any of a variety of arrangements may be employed to clamp the mold halves together. A rigid/semi-rigid insulating carrier layer <b>55</b> is positioned between the mold halves. Insulating carrier layer <b>55</b> may be, for example, a rigid/semi-rigid insulating carrier layer, like carrier layers <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, respectively. With bottom portion <b>59</b>B of mold block <b>52</b>B removed, wound wadded-wire connectors <b>51</b> may be pushed up into apertures <b>53</b>B, <b>53</b> and <b>53</b>A prior to encapsulation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Alternatively, prior to positioning the top mold half and bottom mold half together, wadded-wire conductors <b>51</b> may be positioned in apertures <b>53</b> of insulating carrier layer <b>55</b> where they are held in place by friction. The mold halves may then be positioned over the wadded-wire connectors <b>51</b> so that the connectors are positioned in apertures <b>53</b>A and <b>53</b>B. Liquid elastomeric polymer material is then poured into mold throat/mold layer regions <b>58</b>A/<b>58</b>B and cured.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be understood that the mold arrangements described herein are merely examples of ways in which the wadded-wire connectors may be encapsulated. It is clear that there are any of a variety of ways in which an rigid/semi-rigid and flexible insulating carrier layer with encapsulated wadded wire connectors may be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, apertures <b>23</b>A in insulating carrier layer <b>25</b>A are approximately the same size or slightly smaller than the elastomeric encapsulation <b>29</b>A over wadded-wire connectors <b>21</b>A. Thus, the mold apertures and insulating carrier layer apertures used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> are approximately the same dimension, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, however, the apertures <b>23</b>B in insulating carrier layer <b>25</b>B are considerably smaller than the apertures in the mold blocks <b>53</b>A and <b>53</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The main consideration in either arrangement is that the connector be completely encapsulated. In this regard, it should be understood that the drawings are not to scale nor is the size shown for corresponding parts, as depicted among the various figures, accurately related to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows another interposer arrangement with wadded wire connectors encapsulated with elastomeric polymer material. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A&#x2013;C</figref>, the insulating carrier layers <b>35</b>A, <b>35</b>B and <b>35</b>C may be made of a flexible dielectric material, such as, KAPTON. Materials, such as, UPILEX and epoxy coated woven glass, such as, G10, may also be used, as well as FR4. The modulus for such material may range from 435,000 psi to 1,305,000 psi. The mold arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be used to form the interposer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with the thickness of elastomeric polymer layer <b>37</b>A formed on carrier layer <b>35</b>A being selected to provide the desired degree of stiffness for handling, assembly and thermal cycling. Typically, the thickness of polymer layer <b>37</b>A would be 5 to 10 mils. As shown, the elastomeric encapsulation <b>39</b>A has sloped walls thus necessitating same slope in the aperture of the mold blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Again, the elastomeric polymer material used for encapsulation may be sufficiently soft and thin along the flat interfacing surface of the elastomeric encapsulations such that when the interposer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is clamped between electronic module and PWB, for example, loops and leads of the distal portion of wadded-wire connectors may push through the material skin to make contact with the electrical contacts of the electronic module and PWB. Alternatively, the elastomeric encapsulations may be ablated to expose the wire conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The interposer arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> may be made even thinner by eliminating the formation of the layer of elastomeric material <b>37</b>A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, on the flexible insulating carrier layer <b>35</b>A. The thinner arrangement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. This may be accomplished in any of a variety of ways, such as with the mold arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A&#x2013;C</figref>. As can be seen, the mold blocks <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>B are the same as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A&#x2013;C</figref> with the exception that no recessed regions, as shown at <b>58</b>A and <b>58</b>B is <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A&#x2013;C</figref>. Without these recessions, encapsulation on flexible carrier layer <b>65</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> is limited to the aperture regions <b>63</b>A and <b>63</b>B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. Again, although the apertures <b>63</b>A and <b>63</b>B are shown with vertical cylindrical walls, it is clear that the walls would slope for the encapsulation arrangements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B&#x2013;C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The carrier layer <b>35</b>B of the interposer arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> may be made rigid/semi-rigid by adding additional stiffening layers <b>37</b>C on opposing surfaces thereof between encapsulations <b>39</b>C, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. These stiffening layers may be formed first and then bonded to flexible carrier layer <b>35</b>C or alternatively, may be deposited thereon using some form of deposition technique, such as, vapor deposition, sputtering, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be understood that in any of the interposer arrangements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A&#x2013;C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A&#x2013;C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A&#x2013;B</figref>, that fewer or more layers may be employed in the insulating carrier layer without departing from the spirit of the invention. Included in these layers may be electrically conductive layers to provide shielding or reference planes as well as point to point wiring as known in the printed circuit wiring board art to electrically connect selected wadded wires contacts. In addition, multiple layers of the same or different materials may be employed consistent with the encapsulation of the wadded-wire conductors, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A&#x2013;B</figref> show a further interposer arrangement wherein the insulating carrier layer includes a molding channel/runner for encapsulating the wadded-wire connectors. Thus, insulating carrier layer <b>45</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A&#x2013;B</figref> may comprise a rigid/semi-rigid insulating material, similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A&#x2013;B</figref>. Molding channel/runner <b>46</b> is shown as a through cut in the top portion of insulating carrier layer <b>45</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Molding channel <b>46</b> acts to provide a path in which to feed liquid elastomeric insulating encapsulating material to form wire encapsulations <b>49</b>. It is clear that channel <b>46</b> also includes a runner of hardened encapsulant when the molding process is completed and the encapsulant is cured.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It can be seen that the molding channel/runner <b>46</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A&#x2013;B</figref> acts to feed one row of apertures <b>43</b> in insulating carrier layer <b>45</b>. In practice, however, to encapsulate an array of wadded wire conductors held in the apertures of an insulating carrier layer, it is clear that there would be a molding channel for each row or column of apertures. Alternatively, both rows and columns of molding channels intersecting at apertures in the carrier layer could be employed. The mold blocks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A&#x2013;C</figref> may be employed to fabricate the encapsulation arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A&#x2013;B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the flexible interposer arrangement similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, as positioned between electronic module <b>73</b>, such as a MCM, and substrate <b>77</b>, such as a PWB. Conductive pads <b>76</b> on module <b>73</b> and conductive contacts <b>78</b> on substrate <b>77</b> are conventional metal pads and contacts made of, for example, copper or the like. Compressive force applied to module <b>73</b> and backing layer <b>80</b> on substrate <b>77</b> acts to clamp the arrangement together. A typical clamping force is one that would provide an upward normal force of at least about 30 grams against conductive pads <b>76</b> and a downward normal force of at least 30 grams against conductive contacts <b>78</b>. The clamping force may also act to force the loops and leads of wadded-wire connectors <b>71</b> through the flat skin surface of elastomeric encapsulation region <b>79</b> at each interface with pads <b>76</b> and contacts <b>78</b> to make electrical contact therewith. In addition, the wadded-wire connectors <b>71</b> may deform themselves within the encapsulation as elastomeric encapsulation regions <b>79</b> deform under compressive force.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The overall resilience of the flexible carrier layer <b>75</b>, deformable elastomeric encapsulation regions <b>79</b> and resilient wadded-wire connectors, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, acts to ensure good electrical contact between module and substrate with the overall resilience acting to accommodate thermal and dimensional mismatch between module and substrate. It is clear that in similar manner, that any of the various interposer arrangements described herein will act as the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to provide a resilient connection between electronic module and substrate therefor. Thus, in similar manner, the rigid/semi-rigid insulator carrier layers with elastomeric encapsulation of wadded-wire connectors provides resilience through the elastomeric encapsulation material and wadded wire connector. It is also clear that other forms of resilient connectors may be used. For example, a tubular wire structure may be used with the tube oriented on its side, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The advantages of employing an elastomeric encapsulated wadded-wire connector, in addition to its ability to deform, reside in the fact that there is resilient metal-to-metal contact at the opposing interfaces of the interposer. In addition, the contact is multi-pointed, through loops and leads, with one continuous conductor. By encapsulating the wadded-wire connectors, the connectors are captivated such as to prevent them from falling out and the loops and leads of the connector be not exposed to possible pulls and snags to smear the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It will be understood from the foregoing description that various modifications and changes may be made in the preferred embodiment of the present invention without departing from its true spirit. It is intended that this description is for purposes of illustration only and should not be construed in a limiting sense. The scope of this invention should be limited only by the language of the following claims.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A connector includes multiple pairs of signal contacts arranged in a housing, and facilitates the wiring design and the wiring operation for substrates. The two signal contacts in each of the multiple pairs are arranged at a distance in the longitudinal direction of the housing. With this arrangement, excellent coupling can be established between the two signal contacts, and signals can be balanced-transmitted without causing a phase difference. Also, the lengths of each pair of wires of a wiring substrate to be connected to the multiple pairs of signal contacts can be easily made uniform. Accordingly, there is no need to prepare excessive wiring areas, and the substrate wiring design and the wiring operation can be simplified.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to connectors that are used in computers, servers, and routers, and more particularly, to a connector that has multiple pairs of signal contacts and is suitable especially for balanced transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for a large amount of data transmission, as computers and computer networks have been rapidly developed. Especially, video data transmission needs to be carried out at a speed of 1 Gbit/s or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For this type of data transmission, unbalanced transmission methods have been widely employed conventionally, because they are advantageous in terms of costs. By the unbalanced transmission methods, however, it is difficult to avoid adverse influence of noise. Therefore, to carry out high-speed data transmission, it is more preferable to employ a balanced transmission method that can provide resistibility to noise.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate an example of a conventional connector device of a balanced transmission type. The connector device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> has a jack connector <b>1</b> and a mating plug connector <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The jack connector <b>1</b> includes pairs of signal contacts <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>and ground contacts <b>5</b><i>a </i>in a housing <b>3</b><i>a </i>that is made of an insulating material and is formed longitudinally in the direction of X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The housing <b>3</b><i>a </i>has a concavity <b>6</b><i>a </i>formed longitudinally in the direction of X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b>. Each pair of signal contacts <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>has upper ends <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> and <b>4</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> protruding in the direction of Z<b>1</b> from the bottom wall <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> of the housing <b>3</b><i>a </i>and extending along the side walls <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b> within the concavity <b>6</b><i>a</i>. The signal contacts <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>in each pair face each other in the direction of Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b>. A ground contact <b>5</b><i>a </i>having a fork-like top end <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> is provided between each two neighboring pairs of signal contacts <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The lower ends <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>, and <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> (not shown) of the signal contacts <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>and the ground contacts <b>5</b><i>a </i>each has a pin-like shape extending in the direction of Z<b>2</b> and is inserted into a hole <b>7</b><i>a </i>formed in a substrate <b>8</b><i>a</i>. In this structure, the lower ends <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>, and <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> are connected to a printed circuit (not shown) formed on the substrate <b>8</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The plug connector <b>2</b> has a shape corresponding to the jack connector <b>1</b>, and includes pairs of signal contacts <b>4</b><i>c </i>and <b>4</b><i>d </i>and ground contacts <b>5</b><i>b </i>in a housing <b>3</b><i>b </i>that is made of an insulating material and is formed longitudinally in the direction of X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The housing <b>3</b><i>b </i>has protrusions <b>3</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> arranged at predetermined intervals in the direction of X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> within a concavity <b>6</b><i>b</i>. Each pair of signal contacts <b>4</b><i>c </i>and <b>4</b><i>d </i>has pin-like upper ends <b>4</b><i>c</i>-<b>1</b> and <b>4</b><i>d</i>-<b>1</b> protruding from the bottom wall <b>3</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> of the housing <b>3</b><i>b </i>and extending along the both sides of each corresponding protrusion <b>3</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> in the direction of Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b>. A ground contact <b>5</b><i>b </i>having a flat top end <b>5</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> is provided between each two neighboring pairs of signal contacts <b>4</b><i>c </i>and <b>4</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The lower ends <b>4</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b>, <b>4</b><i>d</i>-<b>2</b>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> (not shown) of the signal contacts <b>4</b><i>c </i>and <b>4</b><i>d </i>and the ground contacts <b>5</b><i>b </i>each has a tongue-like top end that is bent in the direction of Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. This tongue-like top end is fixed to a pad (not shown) formed on a substrate <b>8</b><i>b</i>, and is thus connected to a printed circuit (not shown) formed on the substrate <b>8</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The plug connector <b>2</b> is connected to the jack connector <b>1</b>, so that the signal contacts <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>are brought into contact with the signal contacts <b>4</b><i>c </i>and <b>4</b><i>d</i>, and that the ground contacts <b>5</b><i>a </i>sandwich the corresponding ground contacts <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the signal contacts and the ground contacts are electrically connected to one another. If a positive signal is transmitted through the signal contacts <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>c </i>in this case, a negative signal is transmitted through the signal contacts <b>4</b><i>b </i>and <b>4</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With the above conventional connector device, however, there is a problem that desired balanced transmission cannot be carried out, because the mating lower ends <b>4</b><i>c</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>4</b><i>d</i>-<b>2</b> extend in the opposite directions and cannot establish preferable coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Meanwhile, a wiring pattern may be formed on the substrates, so that one ends of the wires extend from either one side (the Y<b>1</b> side or the Y<b>2</b> side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) of the longitudinal walls of the housings <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, while the other ends of the wires are connected to a terminal unit or the like provided at a predetermined location on a line extending from the one side. In such a case, however, wires of uniform lengths cannot be provided between the terminal unit and each pair of signal contacts, because one of the signal contacts in each pair is located farther away from the terminal unit. The variation of the wire lengths causes phase difference between signals subject to balanced transmission through each pair of signal contacts. The phase difference results in noise, and makes the characteristic impedance unstable.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To prevent the noise generation and stabilize the characteristic impedance, the lengths of wires to be connected to the signal contacts closer to the terminal unit are adjusted to the same lengths as the lengths of the wires to be connected to the signal contacts farther from the terminal unit.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, the employment of wires at the unnecessary locations, i.e., the excessive lengths of wires, only complicates the wiring design and the wiring operation for the substrates.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a connector that has multiple pairs of signal contacts arranged in a housing, and facilitates the wiring design and the wiring operation for substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The connector of the present invention has multiple pairs of signal contacts arranged in a housing. In this connector, the two adjacent signal contacts that are paired with each other are arranged at a distance in the longitudinal direction of the housing. When the signal contacts of the connector are connected to a terminal unit or the like of a substrate facing in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the housing, the lengths of each pair of wires for connecting the multiple pairs of signal contacts to the terminal unit or the like can be made uniform. Accordingly, there is no need to prepare excessive wiring areas, and the wiring design and the wiring operation for substrates can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Here, the connector is either a jack connector or a plug connector. In this connector, the multiple pairs of signal contacts are of a surface mounting type, and have bent ends in contact with a pad on a substrate. The effects of the present invention can be maximized if these bent ends of all the multiple pairs of signal contacts extend in parallel with one another. However, the arrangement of the signal contacts is not limited to this, and each of the signal contacts may have a pin-like top end to be inserted into each corresponding through hole formed in the substrate. In such a case, the multiple pairs of signal contacts are aligned in arrays in the transverse direction of the housing, so that the effects of the present invention can be maximized in the wiring design and the wiring operation for a number of substrates required in accordance with the number of the arrays of signal contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The connector of the present invention may further include an array internal ground contact between each neighboring pairs of the multiple pairs of signal contacts. With this arrangement, crosstalk between each two neighboring pairs of signal contacts can be reduced. The array internal ground contact is large enough to shield the multiple pairs of signal contacts from each neighboring pair.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The connector of the present invention may further include an array intermediate ground contact between each two neighboring arrays of the multiple pairs of signal contacts. With this arrangement, crosstalk between each two neighboring arrays of the multiple pairs of signal contacts can be reduced. The array intermediate ground contact has an exposed flat panel part in the housing. Also, the length of the housing in the longitudinal direction is greater than the distance between each pair of signal contacts of the multiple pairs of signal contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The connector of the present invention may further include a shielding layer that is formed on the exterior of the housing. The shielding layer effectively shields the connector from external electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the connector of the present invention, each of the multiple pairs of signal contacts prevents noise between each pair of signal contacts through which signals travel in balanced transmission. Thus, the characteristic impedance can be stabilized even in a high-speed signal transmitting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention also provides a connector that includes: signal contacts that are arranged in two arrays; and ground contacts that divide each array of signal contacts into multiple pairs. In this connector, the multiple pairs of signal contacts are adjacent to one another over the entire length of each signal contact. Accordingly, coupling is established between each pair of signal contacts, and excellent balanced transmission can be carried out. Also, when the connector is mounted to a substrate, pairs of wires for connecting each pair of signal contacts to a terminal unit or the like on the substrate can be made uniform, because the multiple pairs of signal contacts are adjacent to one another. Accordingly, there is no need to prepare excessive wiring areas on the substrate, and the substrate wiring design and the wiring operation can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the above structure, substrate contact parts of the multiple pairs of signal contacts arranged in one of the two arrays may extend in the opposite direction from substrate contact parts of the multiples pairs of signal contacts arranged in the other one of the two arrays. Accordingly, each two adjacent signal contacts of the two arrays extend in the opposite directions. Thus, excellent high-density balanced transmission can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the above structure, substrate contact parts of the multiple pairs of signal contacts arranged in one of the two arrays may face substrate contact parts of the multiple pairs of signal contacts arranged in the other one of the two arrays, and all the substrate contact parts extend in the same direction. Accordingly, the multiple pairs of signal contacts adjacent to one another are arranged on the two opposite faces of the substrate. Thus, excellent high-density balanced transmission can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the above structure, a pair of signal contacts arranged in one of the two arrays and a pair of signal contacts arranged in the other one of the two arrays may exist between each two neighboring ground contacts. With this arrangement, each pair of signal contacts can be effectively shielded from the neighboring pairs of signal contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the above structure, a pair of signal contacts arranged in one of the two arrays and a pair of signal contacts arranged in the other array that faces the one of the two arrays via an insulating member may exist between each two neighboring ground contacts. With this arrangement, a plug connector can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the above structure, a pair of signal contacts arranged in one of the two arrays and a pair of signal contacts arranged in the other array that faces the one of the two arrays via a space may exist between each two neighboring ground contacts. With this arrangement, a jack connector can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the above structure, the ground contacts may each have a panel-like shape, and be provided in both two arrays. This is an example of the structure of a ground contact.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the above structure, each of the ground contacts may be provided across both two arrays, and have two substrate contact parts facing each other. Accordingly, the ground contacts have the same structures as the signal contacts, and thus are extended toward the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the above structure, each of the ground contacts may have a pair of contact parts. In this case, one of the pair of contact parts is aligned with substrate contact parts of the multiple pairs of signal contacts arranged in one of the two arrays, while the other one of the pair of contact parts is aligned with substrate contact parts of the multiple pairs of signal contacts arranged in the other one of the two arrays. With this arrangement, the substrate contact parts of the ground contacts can be aligned with the substrate contact parts of the signal contacts. Thus, the substrate wiring design and wiring operation can be further simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the above structure, first parts of the signal contacts to be connected to a mating connector may extend in a direction perpendicular to second parts of the signal contacts to be connected to terminals on the substrate. Alternatively, the first parts of the signal contacts to be connected to a mating connector may extend in the opposite direction from the second parts of the signal contacts to be connected to terminals on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the above structure, the signal contacts arranged in the two arrays may be aligned at intervals in the longitudinal direction of the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The connector of the present invention may further include other signal contacts that are provided in each array. These other signal contacts in each array are arranged at intervals, without the ground contacts being interposed among the other signal contacts. The arrangement of signal contact without ground contact is suitable for unbalanced transmission at a relatively low speed. Accordingly, a complex connector that is suitable for both balanced transmission and unbalanced transmission can be realized with the above structure.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The present invention also provides an electronic device that includes a wiring substrate and a connector that is mounted to the wiring substrate. In this electronic device, the connector is one of the above described connectors of the present invention. This electronic device may be a printed wiring board to which one of the connectors of the present invention is mounted.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the ground contacts <b>16</b> has upper ends <b>16</b><i>a </i>branching apart in the direction of Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b>, and the tops of the angular upper ends <b>16</b><i>a </i>are inclined toward each other. The lower ends <b>16</b><i>b </i>of each of the ground contacts <b>16</b> also branch apart in the direction of Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b>, and are bent in the horizontal direction. The ground contacts <b>16</b> are array internal ground contacts that shield the neighboring pairs of signal contacts <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>, and <b>141</b><i>b </i>from one another.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The housing <b>30</b> has a concavity <b>38</b> formed longitudinally in the direction of X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, holes <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>are formed through the bottom wall <b>30</b><i>a</i>, and slits <b>42</b> are longitudinally and transversely formed so as to partition each pair of holes <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>off the other pairs. Also, two slits <b>44</b> are formed along the inner surfaces of the side walls of the housing <b>30</b>. The arrangement of the holes <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>and the slits <b>42</b> corresponds to the arrangement of the holes <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>and the slits <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> of the jack connector <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Each of the signal contacts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b</i>, <b>132</b><i>a</i>, and <b>132</b><i>b </i>has an L-shape. Each one signal contact <b>32</b><i>a </i>is paired with one signal contact <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and each one signal contact <b>132</b><i>a </i>is paired with one signal contact <b>132</b><i>b</i>. Each pair of signal contacts <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and signal contacts <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b</i>, is inserted into each corresponding pair of holes <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>from the Z<b>2</b> side.

Accordingly, the signal contacts are arranged as multiple rows in the direction of X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b>, and as two arrays in the direction of Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each of the array internal ground contacts <b>34</b> has a flat-panel shape with a step-like notch <b>34</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The connection mechanism of the above jack connector <b>10</b> and the plug connector <b>28</b> will be described below, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates only one of the arrays of signal contacts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates the ground contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">When the plug connector <b>28</b> is to be connected to the jack connector <b>10</b>, the signal contacts <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>are inserted into the holes <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, while pushing the upper ends <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> and <b>14</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> of the signal contacts <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>in the direction of Y<b>2</b>. By virtue of the restoring force of the signal contacts <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>, each signal contact <b>32</b><i>a </i>is brought into contact with each corresponding signal contact <b>14</b><i>a</i>, and each signal contact <b>32</b><i>b </i>is brought into each corresponding signal contact <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, each of the array internal ground contacts <b>34</b> is inserted into each corresponding slit <b>20</b>, while pushing apart the upper ends <b>16</b><i>a </i>of each corresponding ground contact <b>16</b> in the directions of Y<b>1</b> and Y<b>2</b>. By virtue of the restoring force of the ground contacts <b>16</b>, each of the array internal ground contacts <b>34</b> is interposed between the upper ends <b>16</b><i>a </i>of each corresponding ground contact <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In this manner, it can be made sure that the signal contacts <b>14</b><i>a</i>, the signal contacts <b>14</b><i>b</i>, and the ground contacts <b>16</b> are electrically connected to the signal contacts <b>32</b><i>a</i>, the signal contacts <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and the array internal ground contacts <b>34</b>, respectively.

The shielding layers <b>24</b> are slidably in contact with the shielding layers <b>46</b>, and are thus electrically connected to the shielding layers <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The substrate <b>26</b> to which the jack connector <b>10</b> is mounted is connected to the substrate <b>48</b> to which the plug connector <b>28</b> is mounted, with the jack connector <b>10</b> and the plug connector <b>28</b> being interposed in between. In this connected state, one of the substrates <b>26</b> and <b>48</b> is stacked on the other.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Each pair of signal contacts <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>114</b><i>a </i>and <b>114</b><i>b</i>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b</i>, is designed for balanced transmission. If a positive signal is transmitted through the signal contacts <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>a</i>, and <b>132</b><i>a</i>, a negative signal is transmitted through the signal contacts <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>114</b><i>b</i>, <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and <b>132</b><i>b</i>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">With the above plug connector <b>28</b> and the jack connector <b>10</b> in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, the wiring design and the wiring operation for the substrates are simple, because the lengths of each pair of wires for connecting the multiple pairs of signal contacts to a terminal unit can be made uniform in a case where the terminal unit located perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the housing is to be connected to signal contacts to mount the connector device onto the substrates. Also, noise can be prevented between signals subject to balanced transmission through each pair of signal contacts, and the characteristic impedance can be stabilized even in a high-speed signal transmitting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Also, since an array internal ground contact is provided between each two neighboring pairs of signal contacts in plug connector <b>28</b> and the jack connector <b>10</b>, crosstalk between each two neighboring pairs of signal contacts can be reduced. Particularly, the array internal ground contacts of the plug connector <b>28</b> are large enough to shield each pair of signal contacts from the neighboring pairs of signal contacts, and thus can effectively reduce crosstalk.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further, with the array intermediate ground connector, the plug connector <b>28</b> can reduce crosstalk between the arrays of signal contacts. Also, with the shielding layers formed on the side walls of the housings, the plug connector <b>28</b> and the jack connector <b>10</b> can shield themselves from external electromagnetic waves.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>, each of the ground contacts <b>216</b> has two substrate contact parts <b>216</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>216</b>-<b>2</b>, and a plate-like part <b>216</b>-<b>3</b> formed integrally with the two substrate contact parts <b>216</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>216</b>-<b>2</b>. The ground contacts <b>216</b> are arranged in both two arrays of signal contacts. The plate-like part <b>216</b>-<b>3</b> of each ground contact <b>216</b> penetrates through the corresponding rectangular hole <b>223</b> formed in the housing <b>211</b> and the contact supporting member <b>213</b>, and extends in the vertical direction. The top of each plate-like part <b>216</b>-<b>3</b> protrudes from the upper surface of the contact supporting member <b>213</b>. Accordingly, the ground contacts <b>216</b> may be taller than or as tall as the signal contacts <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>, <b>215</b><i>a</i>, and <b>215</b><i>b</i>. To effectively shield each pair of signal contacts from the neighboring pairs, the width of each plate-like part <b>216</b>-<b>3</b> is greater than the distance between each two adjacent signal contacts <b>214</b><i>a </i>(<b>214</b><i>b</i>) and <b>215</b><i>a </i>(<b>215</b><i>b</i>). The substrate contact part <b>216</b>-<b>1</b> of each ground contact <b>216</b> extends in such a manner as to be connected to a connection terminal such as a pad provided on a mounting surface. The substrate contact parts <b>216</b>-<b>1</b> are on the same level (an even level without a step) as the substrate contact parts <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> of the signal contacts <b>214</b><i>a</i>, and also extend in the same direction as the substrate contact parts <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> of the signal contacts <b>214</b><i>a</i>. The other substrate contact part <b>216</b>-<b>2</b> of each ground contact <b>216</b> is formed in the same manner as the above. The substrate contact parts <b>216</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>216</b>-<b>2</b> extend in the opposite directions.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In this structure, an array of multiple pairs of substrate contact parts <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>214</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>, with a substrate ground contact part <b>216</b>-<b>1</b> being interposed between each two neighboring pairs, and an array of multiple pairs of substrate contact parts <b>215</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>215</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>, with a substrate ground contact part <b>216</b>-<b>2</b> being interposed between each two neighboring pairs, are formed on the side of a wiring substrate. The two arrays of substrate contact parts exist on the same level, and extend in the opposite directions. The substrate contact parts <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>, and the substrate ground contact parts <b>216</b>-<b>1</b>, are aligned at uniform intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Protruding parts <b>224</b> are formed at the left and right sides of the housing <b>211</b>, and cylindrical fixing members <b>225</b> are inserted into holes formed in the protruding parts <b>224</b>. Each of the fixing members <b>225</b> is inserted into each corresponding through hole formed in the wiring substrate, and is then fixed by soldering. Thus, the connector <b>210</b> can be mounted and fixed to the wiring substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The substrate contact parts <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>214</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> in each pair extend in parallel with each other and have the same lengths, so that signals can travel in balanced transmission in the same phase on the wiring substrate. Likewise, the substrate contact parts <b>215</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>215</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> in each pair expend in parallel with each other and have the same lengths, so that signals can be transmitted in the balanced state in the same phase on the wiring substrate. As a result, noise that was caused by a phase difference in the prior art can be prevented, and the characteristic impedance can be stabilized. Also, the substrate contact parts <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>214</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> are adjacent to one another, and the substrate contact parts <b>215</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>215</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> are also adjacent to one another. Thus, the lengths of each pair of wires on the wiring substrate can be easily made uniform, and the wiring design and the wiring operation for the wiring substrate can be readily simplified. Furthermore, even in the two-array structure, the pairs of signal contacts are adjacent to one another over the entire length. Accordingly, excellent high-density balanced transmission can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The pairs of signal contacts adjacent to one another in the longitudinal direction of the connector <b>210</b> are electrically shielded from one another by the ground contacts <b>216</b>, and accordingly, there is no interference between each two neighboring pairs of signal contacts in each array. Meanwhile, each pair of signal contacts <b>214</b><i>a </i>and <b>214</b><i>b </i>faces each corresponding pair of signal contacts <b>215</b><i>a </i>and <b>215</b><i>b </i>via the contact supporting member <b>213</b> made of an insulating material, and any shielding member like the array intermediate ground contact <b>36</b> of the first embodiment is not employed in this embodiment. Accordingly, compared with the first embodiment, there is a greater possibility that phase difference is caused between the arrays of signal contacts facing each other via the contact supporting member <b>213</b>, and noise is then generated. However, chances are that there will be no problems in practice, as long as the distance between each pair of signal contacts <b>214</b><i>a </i>and <b>214</b><i>b </i>and the distance between each pair of signal contacts <b>215</b><i>a </i>and <b>215</b><i>b </i>are shorter than the diagonal distance between each two opposite signal contacts <b>214</b><i>a </i>and <b>215</b><i>b </i>and the diagonal distance between each two opposite signal contacts <b>214</b><i>b </i>and <b>215</b><i>a</i>, respectively. Since a shielding member like the array intermediate ground contact <b>36</b> of the first embodiment is not employed, this embodiment has an advantage of reducing the production costs of the connector requiring a smaller number of components.</p>

Each substrate contact part <b>265</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> extends in such a manner as to be connected to a connection terminal such as a pad provided on a mounting surface of a printed circuit board.

<p id="p-0156" num="0155">As a result, the connector contact parts <b>264</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, <b>264</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>, <b>265</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, and <b>265</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>, extend in the same direction as the substrate contact parts <b>264</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>264</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>, while the substrate contacts <b>265</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>265</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> extend in the opposite direction from the substrate contact parts <b>264</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>264</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Each of the connector contact parts <b>264</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, <b>264</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>, <b>265</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, and <b>265</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> has an inward protrusion, and is tilted inward so as to provide spring tension. When the plug connector <b>210</b> is attached to the jack connector <b>250</b>, the connector contact parts <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> <b>215</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, and <b>215</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> of the plug connector <b>210</b> are engaged with the corresponding connector contact parts <b>264</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, <b>264</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>, <b>265</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, and <b>265</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>, and the inward protrusions pushes outward the connector contact parts <b>214</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> <b>215</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, and <b>215</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>. By virtue of the spring restoring force of the connector contact parts <b>234</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, <b>234</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>, <b>235</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>, and <b>235</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>, electric connection can be surely established.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>, each of the ground contacts <b>266</b> has two substrate contact parts <b>266</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>266</b>-<b>2</b>, two connector contact parts <b>266</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>266</b>-<b>4</b>, and a base part <b>266</b>-<b>5</b>. Each of the contact parts <b>266</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>266</b>-<b>4</b> and the base parts <b>266</b>-<b>5</b> is a single member that may be formed by stamping out a gold-plated flat panel of a copper alloy and then bending the stamped-out part. Each of the connector contact parts <b>266</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>266</b>-<b>4</b> penetrates through each corresponding hole formed in the housing <b>251</b>, and extends along the inside of the concavity <b>253</b>. Each two adjacent connector contact parts <b>266</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>266</b>-<b>4</b> face each other via a space. Each of the connector contact parts <b>266</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>366</b>-<b>4</b> has an inward protrusion, and is tilted inward so as to provide spring tension. In other words, the connector contact parts <b>266</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>266</b>-<b>4</b> are the same as the connector contact parts <b>264</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> and <b>265</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>. When the plug connector <b>210</b> is attached to the jack connector <b>250</b>, the protrusions of the connector contact parts <b>266</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>266</b>-<b>4</b> are engaged with the corresponding ground contacts <b>216</b> of the plug connector <b>210</b>, and pushes these connector contact parts outward. Thus, electric connection can be surely established. The substrate contact parts <b>266</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>266</b>-<b>2</b> are bent outward at approximately 90 degrees with respect to the base parts <b>266</b>-<b>5</b>, and extend in the opposite directions. In this structure, an array of multiple pairs of substrate contact parts <b>264</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>264</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>, with a substrate ground contact part <b>266</b>-<b>1</b> being interposed between each two neighboring pairs, and an array of multiple pairs of substrate contact parts <b>265</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>265</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>, with a substrate ground contact part <b>266</b>-<b>2</b> being interposed between each two neighboring pairs, are formed on the side of the wiring substrate.

<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The substrate contact parts <b>264</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>264</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> in each pair extend in parallel with each other and have the same lengths, so that signals can be balanced-transmitted in the same phase. Likewise, the substrate contact parts <b>265</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>265</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> in each pair expend in parallel with each other and have the same lengths, so that signals can be transmitted in the same phase under the balanced condition. As a result, noise that was caused by a phase difference in the prior art can be prevented, and the characteristic impedance can be stabilized. Also, the substrate contact parts <b>264</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>264</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> are adjacent to one another at uniform intervals, and the substrate contact parts <b>235</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>235</b><i>b</i>-<b>2</b> are also adjacent to one another at uniform intervals. Thus, the lengths of each pair of wires on the wiring substrate can be easily made uniform, and the wiring design and the wiring operation for the wiring substrate can be readily simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">When the jack connector <b>250</b> and the plug connector <b>210</b> are connected to each other, the ground contacts <b>216</b> of the plug connector <b>210</b> are inserted between the pairs of signal contacts adjacent to one another in the array direction of the jack connector <b>250</b>.

Although the connectors of the foregoing embodiments are to be mounted onto a mounting surface of a wiring substrate, the connector <b>270</b> of the fifth embodiment is to be mounted to a wiring substrate, with the wiring substrate being interposed in the connector <b>270</b>. The substrate contact parts described later can be connected to connection terminals provided on two opposite planes of a wiring substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The connector <b>270</b> includes a housing <b>271</b> having a concavity <b>272</b>. The housing <b>271</b> is made of an insulating material such as polyester or liquid crystal polymer resin.

Each one signal contact <b>274</b><i>a </i>is paired with one signal contact <b>274</b><i>b</i>, and each pair of signal contacts <b>274</b><i>a </i>and <b>274</b><i>b </i>is designed for balance transmission of signals at a speed higher than <b>1</b> Gbit/s or higher. Accordingly, signals of the same sizes and the opposite polarities are transmitted through each pair of signal contacts <b>274</b><i>a </i>and <b>274</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The pairs of signal contacts <b>274</b><i>a </i>and <b>274</b><i>b </i>are adjacent to one another over the entire length, and are uniformly arranged.

<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The multiple pairs of signal contacts <b>274</b><i>a </i>and <b>274</b><i>b </i>are arranged in parallel with one another at intervals on one of the two planes of the contact supporting member <b>273</b>. Accordingly, the signal contacts <b>274</b><i>a </i>and <b>274</b><i>b </i>are aligned at intervals in one array in the longitudinal direction of the housing <b>271</b>. Likewise, each one signal contact <b>275</b><i>a </i>is paired with one signal contact <b>275</b><i>b</i>, and each pair of signal contacts <b>275</b><i>a </i>and <b>275</b><i>b </i>is designed for balanced transmission. The multiple pairs of signal contacts <b>275</b><i>a </i>and <b>275</b><i>b </i>are arranged in parallel with one another at intervals on the other plane of the contact supporting member <b>273</b>. Accordingly, the signal contacts <b>275</b><i>a </i>and <b>275</b><i>b </i>are aligned in one array at intervals in the longitudinal direction of the housing <b>271</b>. Thus, the connector <b>270</b> has a two-array structure that includes the array of signal contacts <b>274</b><i>a </i>and <b>274</b><i>b </i>and the array of signal contacts <b>275</b><i>a </i>and <b>275</b><i>b. </i></p>

<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Rectangular holes are formed in the contact supporting member <b>273</b>, and ground contacts <b>276</b> are arranged in the rectangular holes.

As a result, the substrate contact parts <b>274</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and the substrate contact parts <b>275</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> are pushed outward. By virtue of the restoring force of the substrate contact parts <b>274</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b> and <b>275</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b>, electric contact with the connection electrodes provided on the two facing planes of the wiring substrate can be surely established.

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/487,045, entitled &#x201c;Cigarette Up The Nose,&#x201d; filed Jul. 11, 2003 by Applicant herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to magic trick devices and methods and more particularly to such tricks which use a &#x201c;pull&#x201d; methodology.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Magic tricks and devices have long been used to entertain audiences. In an early publication titled &#x201c;Scots Discovery of Witchcraft&#x201d; (1651) there is disclosed a magic trick methodology referred to herein as retraction where one portion of an object is retracted into another to produce the illusion of movement. In the Scots reference there is disclosed a &#x201c;bodkin&#x201d; where a blade portion is retracted into a handle to produce the illusion of the blade penetrating the body.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another methodology for producing a different effect from retraction is referred to as a &#x201c;pull.&#x201d; In a &#x201c;pull&#x201d; trick, a line is attached to an object. The line is biased, such as by having a weight attached to one end to fall within the magician's coat or pant leg or by using an elastic line. The magician holds the object, e.g. a handkerchief, against the bias and at the appropriate time releases the object at which time. As a result of the bias of the line, the object is pulled into a coat sleeve or vest to produce the illusion that the object has disappeared.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Heretofore the methodologies of retraction and pull have been mutually exclusive. That is, a retraction trick need not employ a pull since the very illusion produced by the retraction was sufficient to produce the desired illusion. Conversely, a pull trick was thought to be sufficient in its own right without adding a retraction. To my knowledge no one has combined the retraction and pull concepts or methodologies into a single magic trick illusion.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is, therefore, set forth according to the present invention a magic trick device and method for a performer to perform an illusion of inserting a stick object into another object which could be a nostril, ear, mouth or other object. The device includes the stick object having a rigid body with a first end and a second end and a distinguishable sleeve member slidable along the body from a first position to a position proximate the second end. A pull including a tether is coupled to the object at the first end and is adapted to extend through the sleeve, vest pant leg or other part of the clothing component of the performer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The performer holds the object exposed in one hand with the second end at the ear or nostril while moving the sleeve member along the body toward the second end to invoke the illusion of insertion of the object. The pull includes means for exerting a force by the tether on the object to pull the object into the sleeve for concealment thereof upon release of the object from the one hand.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The pull tether may be elastic such that the tether is elastically stretched when the object is held exposed and elastically contracts to withdraw the object into the sleeve. The bias of the pull may also be exerted by a weight, coil spring or other means for retracting the object.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment the object is in the form of a filter cigarette with the sleeve configured to appear as the filter. In another embodiment the object is in the form of a pen with the sleeve configured to appear as a cap for the pen.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Reference is now made to the figures wherein like parts are referred to by like numerals throughout. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is shown a device <b>10</b> according to the present invention embodied as a facsimile of a filter cigarette. While the following description is directed to the device <b>10</b> in the form of a cigarette it should be understood that the device could as well be a pencil, pen, wand or any other stick object.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The device <b>10</b> includes a rigid body <b>12</b> having a first end <b>14</b> and a second end <b>16</b>. A sleeve <b>18</b> is moveably disposed on the body <b>12</b> for movement between the first and second ends <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. To retain the sleeve <b>18</b> on the body <b>12</b>, the first end <b>14</b> includes a plug <b>20</b> which may be secured to the body <b>12</b> by a press-fit, adhesive, staking or any other suitable attachment means. As can be appreciated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the plug <b>20</b> is slightly enlarged from the body <b>12</b> to define a stop for the sleeve <b>18</b>. The second end <b>16</b> may include a slight flare <b>22</b> also adapted to define a stop for the sleeve <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the embodiment shown, the body <b>12</b> is presented as a cigarette with the sleeve <b>18</b> having a different color to appear as the filter for the cigarette. For example, the body <b>12</b> may be white in color with the sleeve <b>18</b> being a brown or tan. As can be appreciated, when properly exhibited, the movement of the sleeve <b>18</b>, in this optional embodiment depicted as a cigarette filter, along the body <b>12</b> will produce an illusion of a retraction as more fully described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To provide the &#x201c;pull,&#x201d; a line tether <b>22</b> is attached at one end to the plug <b>20</b> such as by tying, adhesive or any other suitable means. The tether <b>22</b> is adapted to exert a pulling bias on the device <b>10</b> to pull the device into a coat arm sleeve, vest, pant leg, shirt, another object or the like. The tether <b>22</b> is therefore connected at the end opposite the device <b>10</b> to a weight (where the bias is induced by gravity) and the weight position to fall into a pant leg or along the back of the performer's coat. Where the tether <b>22</b> is elastic, the end opposite the device <b>10</b> is secured, such as by a safety pin, to the inside of the performer's arm sleeve, shirt or vest. The tether <b>22</b> has a length to enable the performer, against the bias, to present and handle the device <b>10</b> before the audience.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To perform the trick, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and where an elastic pull is used, the performer pins the end of the tether to the inside armpit of the sleeve for the left or right arm as shown in inset <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The performer puts on the coat as shown in inserts <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and ensures that (a) the device <b>10</b> is concealed within the coat sleeve and (b) that the device can be withdrawn against the bias of the pull tether <b>22</b> to extend from the cuff and into the hand for manipulation before the audience. Before the audience the performer produces the device <b>10</b>, e.g. cigarette, in a manner to conceal production of the device <b>10</b> from the coat sleeve. Using a pack of cigarettes or an actual cigarette from the audience and switching to the device <b>10</b> may be a suitable ploy to enhance the illusion. In insets <b>5</b>&#x2013;<b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the performer has pulls the device <b>10</b> from the coat sleeve and holds the device in the right hand by the plug <b>20</b> and sleeve <b>18</b>. In inset <b>10</b>&#x2013;<b>12</b> the performer positions the body <b>12</b> second end <b>22</b> proximate a nostril and slides the sleeve <b>18</b> along the body <b>12</b> to give the illusion that the device, e.g. cigarette, is being inserted into the nostril. The relative movement of the sleeve <b>18</b> embodied as a cigarette filter enhances the illusion to give the impression of relative movement. In inset <b>12</b> it is shown that the sleeve <b>18</b> has engaged the flare <b>22</b> at the second end <b>16</b>, the body <b>12</b> is concealed by the performer's hand and the elastic tether <b>22</b> is stretched to exert its bias on the device <b>10</b>. When the sleeve <b>18</b> reaches the second end <b>22</b> (and depending upon any embellishments the performer may wish to add), the performer releases the device <b>10</b> at which time the tether <b>22</b> pulls the device into the coat sleeve for concealment thereof. Inserts <b>13</b>&#x2013;<b>15</b> show the final steps of the performance where the performer shows his right hand to establish that the device <b>10</b> is no longer in view. The audience is thereby convinced that the performer has inserted the cigarette into his nostril.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The device <b>10</b> may take a variety of forms including any stick object such as an ink pen, wand, or other object. For example, in an optional embodiment where the device <b>10</b> is a pen, the barrel could be the rigid body with the sleeve member configured as the pen cap. As illustrated in the optional embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the device <b>10</b> could be embodied as a cigarette with a rigid body made from, for example, plastic products with the filter configured as the sleeve member.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">While certain embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described it is to be understood that the present invention is subject to many modifications and changes without departing from the spirit and scope of the claims presented herein.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A handgrip for a colonoscope shaft capable of measuring and presenting to the operator of radial and longitudinal forces applied by the operator during the manipulation with the colonoscope. The handgrip includes an internal sleeve positioned over the shaft of the colonoscope so that it can be released and repositioned by depressing a release button. And external sleeve covers the internal sleeve and provides for a convenient grip by the operator. The only means of transmission of force applied by the operator from the external sleeve to the internal sleeve is the engaging means such as a flexible rectangular bar or a set of engaging plates imbedded between the external sleeve and internal sleeve. The engaging means are equipped with a set of sensors such as strain gages positioned on all sides of the bar to measure the forces between the sleeves, which correspond to the forces applied by the operator to the shaft of the colonoscope. The measurements are then transmitted to an electronic unit for data processing and then further to a display system such as a personal computer.</p>

More particularly, the invention describes a handgrip to be positioned over the shaft of the scope such as a colonoscope allowing to measure and display insertion forces and torque throughout the procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In many cases, it has been desirable to examine internal organs, passages and the like of the human body for purposes of diagnosis, biopsy, and therapeutic interventions. One method of examining the internal organs of the patient without major surgery is to insert a remote sensing device such as an endoscope into the body through a natural body orifice such as colon or a specially prepared surgical opening.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The primary area of application of the invention is for use with a colonoscope but other devices can also be used with the handgrip of the invention. Therefore, the word &#x201c;colonoscope&#x201d; is used throughout this description to broadly include various types of direct vision and fiberoptic endoscopes, fiberscopes, arthoscopes, laparoscopes, and other types or steerable and deflectable catheters and tubes designed to be inserted into tight openings and curved passages.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of steerable scopes for internal examination is not limited to medicine. Remote sensing devices can be used to examine the interior of otherwise inaccessible mechanical structures without opening them; such as aircraft wings, the walls of buildings, and the enclosed areas of any structure. In these cases, an internal examination, without putting a major opening in the structure, can help to determine the reason for mechanical failure or the level of corrosion levels.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The preferred area of interest for the device of the present invention is in medicine, and more particularly in colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is the preferred method to screen for colorectal cancer, a disease that afflicts 115,000 patients/year in the US. Several million screening, diagnostic and therapeutic colonoscopies are performed each year in the U.S. hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. Colonoscopy requires a physician to inspect the colonic mucosal surface by applying force to a colonoscope and advancing this flexible tube through a series of stationary and movable colonic loops.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When using a colonoscope, a common problem is to be able to maneuver the inspection end of the scope and position it in proximity to the area of interest. This maneuvering is performed by a trained operator who uses a combination of visual inspection of images and tactile coordination to maneuver through the twists and turns found in the colon. The operator will subjectively sense the resistance to maneuvers by the &#x201c;feel&#x201d; of the instrument and anticipate the amount of force necessary to advance the device forward. The application of force to the colon and its anatomic attachments can be painful. Particularly undesirable is the frequent occurrence of excessive contact pressure on an internal tissue, which can result in perforation. Sedation with analgesia is frequently required to make the procedure comfortable. Preliminary studies suggest that there is significant variation in the forces applied and that these forces can be excessive. Operator training programs are designed to reduce the variation in technique, however training metrics remain subjective and the characterization of effective, less forceful insertion methods is not yet available. The need therefore exists to provide a device allowing an effective, low-cost method to define best practices and to implement these practices as part of training, ongoing education and quality assurance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is an extensive array of surgical instruments, catheters and endoscopes that can be introduced and guided into and through both solid and hollow organ systems such as gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and heart, urologic and gynecologic systems. These devices are designed to perform a variety of functions such as illumination, introduction of radiographic contrast materials and other fluids, surgical therapies, dilation, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Examples of such guiding or steering techniques and systems for catheters may be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 4,983,165 to Loiterman entitled &#x201c;Guidance System For Vascular Catheter Or The Like,&#x201d; U.S. Pat. No. 4,776,844 to Ueda entitled &#x201c;Medical Tube,&#x201d; U.S. Pat. No. 4,934,340 to Ebling et al. entitled &#x201c;Device For Guiding Medical Catheters and Scopes,&#x201d; U.S. Pat. No. 4,930,521 to Metzget et al. entitled &#x201c;Variable Stiffness Esophageal Catheter,&#x201d; U.S. Pat. No. 3,470 to Barchilon entitled &#x201c;Dirigible Catheter,&#x201d; U.S. Pat. No. 3,605,725 to Bentov entitled &#x201c;Controlled Motion Devices,&#x201d; and the Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#x201c;PCT&#x201d;) Patent Application No. PCT W088/00810 of Tenerz et al. entitled &#x201c;Guide For Mechanical Guiding Of A Catheter In Connection With Cardio And Vessel Examination.&#x201d; These catheters, however, failed to give the operator sufficient control of the distal end of the catheter and made it difficult to manipulate the distal end for specific isolation on particular sections of the body vessel or cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other steerable catheters or systems have been made to try to give the physician control of the use of the catheter during surgical procedures wherein fluids and the various tools are needed for the operation by providing a flexible tube for controlling the direction of movement of the distal end of the catheter. Examples of these other attempts may be seen in the PCT Patent Application No. PCTW091/11213 of Lundquist et al. entitled &#x201c;Catheter Steering Mechanism,&#x201d; European Patent Application No. 370,158 of Martin entitled &#x201c;Catheter For Prolonged Access,&#x201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,142 to Heckele entitled &#x201c;Instrument For Examination And Treatment Of Bodily Passages.&#x201d; These devices, however, still failed to provide the control and manipulation of the catheter needed for use with the surgical tools and fluids required for an operation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The need therefore exists for a handheld force measuring attachment device to be mounted on the colonoscope tube. This handgrip device is desirable to be easy to use, inexpensive to manufacture and result in less painful and safer colonoscopies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to overcome these and other drawbacks of the prior art by providing a novel handgrip for a colonoscope or a similar instrument that indicates to an operator the levels of force and torque developed during the manipulation of the colonoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is another object of the present invention to provide a force and torque indicating handgrip, which can be easily used with a variety of commercially available scope instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a handgrip adapted for sliding along the shaft of the colonoscope during its insertion and removal so that the area of grip by the hand of the operator can be changed depending on the clinical necessity.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a handgrip, which can be reused multiple times and can withstand disinfection and sterilization by all commonly used methods without the loss of sensitivity or any undesirable change in force and torque indication.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The handgrip of the invention consists of an internal sleeve and an external sleeve slidingly positioned about the internal sleeve. An engaging means are positioned between both sleeves. As a result of that arrangement, in order to manipulate the colonoscope, the operator has to apply the necessary force and torque to the external sleeve of the device, which then transmits that force and torque through the engaging means first to the internal sleeve and then further to the colonoscope shaft itself. Sensor means are incorporated with the engaging means so that these forces can be accurately measured at the point of the engaging means and this measurement will correspond to the force and torque applied by the operator to the colonoscope shaft. That data is then transmitted to an indication device such as a PC or a visual display after an appropriate data processing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to place the handgrip of the invention over the shaft of the colonoscope, provisions are made to allow both sleeves to be opened and closed such as with a clam-shell design. Alternatively, the shaft can be passed through the solid body handgrip prior to the procedure. Another contemplated alternative is to make a rigid opening in both sleeves such as in a C-shaped cross-section to then pass the shaft into the handgrip from a side.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRST PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Colonoscopy procedure will now be briefly described. Colonoscopy requires that push/pull and torque forces be applied to the instrument to advance it through the colon. The forces applied account for the two most important limitations of colonoscopy: pain and colonic perforation. Conscious and deep sedation is used to control pain and the anxiety associated with anticipation of pain and is administered as a combination of an analgesic and sedative. Sedation enables the patient to tolerate greater forces applied by the operator to advance the instrument. There is significant variability in the amount of sedation used with some operators requiring little or no sedation and others using deep sedation. These observations suggest that the technical performance of the endoscopy is critically important in causing pain. In addition, perforation is the most serious complication of colonoscopy. The reported rate of colonic perforations varies widely and is estimated to be 0.01 to 0.3%. Perforations occur in both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The structure, position and relation of the colon to the peritoneum and other organs affect the performance of the colonoscopy. Specific factors influencing the success of the procedure include: redundancy of colonic loops, presence of adhesions, prior surgery, acute angulation and stenosis with or without diverticular disease. The colon does loop in a variety of configurations and the force applied to the colonoscope may result in forward motion or a lateral force that is often associated with pain. Prior surgery frequently restricts mobility and increases the force required to traverse a particular part of the colon. Acute angulation is found in the recto-sigmoid, splenic and hepatic flexures and requires operators to increase push/pull and torque force to advance the instrument. The application of force against the wall of the colon can be substantial. Finally, stenosis or narrowing can be encountered and this often restricts the mobility adds to the angulation and distorts colonic configuration. In general, patient discomfort is considered a measure of force applied and increases in pain are likely to represent excess force.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A detailed description of the present invention now follows with reference to accompanying drawings in which like elements are indicated by like reference letters and numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A general block-diagram of the handgrip is shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The handgrip <b>20</b> is shown placed around a shaft or the tube <b>10</b> of the colonoscope. Note that only a small portion of the shaft is shown on the drawing in the vicinity of the grip area for the operator to handle the device. The handgrip is equipped with force and torque sensor means (as will be described in more detail below). The data from the sensor means is transmitted via a cable <b>60</b> to an electronic unit <b>61</b> for initial data processing, following by a second transmission via a cable <b>62</b> to a personal computer <b>63</b> or another display apparatus for a presentation of data to the operator. As can be well appreciated by those skilled in the art, wireless transmission of data from the handgrip to the electronic unit and then to the computer is also possible and will fall within the scope of the invention. In an alternate configuration, a separate data presentation window is incorporated into the image display of the colonoscope device itself. This configuration is especially beneficial for integrated devices when the handgrip of the invention is a part of the entire colonoscope setup.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The handgrip <b>20</b> will now be described in more detail. The first embodiment of the handgrip is shown in greater detail on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2&#x2013;7</figref>. The handgrip <b>20</b> consists of an external sleeve <b>21</b> slidingly positioned over an internal sleeve <b>30</b> with an engaging means <b>50</b> located therebetween. The external sleeve <b>21</b> has a shape adapted for easy grip by a human hand as shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>. In its preferred configuration, the shape of the external sleeve is such that it covers almost entirely the internal sleeve <b>30</b> so that the operator holds the entire device only by the external sleeve. To allow its placement over the shaft <b>10</b> of the colonoscope, the external sleeve <b>21</b> is made in two halves <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> connected together on one side by a spring <b>22</b> biased in a way as to allow them to open when the clamp <b>23</b> is released. The spring <b>22</b> is also positioned to allow one half of the external sleeve to swing away and towards another. Alternatively, the halves <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> may be molded from a polymer material with a living hinge therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The internal sleeve <b>30</b> in turn also consists of two halves <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> connected together on one side by a hinge <b>31</b>. There is no need for a clamp on the opposite side to keep both halves together as they are retained by an external sleeve <b>21</b>. The shape of the sleeves is such that they fit entirely inside the external sleeve <b>21</b>. The internal sleeve may therefore be positioned over the colonoscope shaft and engaged therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Release button <b>40</b> is incorporated into the internal sleeve <b>30</b> so that the handgrip can be released from the shaft <b>10</b> of the colonoscope and moved over to a new location. The release button <b>40</b> is designed to constantly engage the shaft with a rough surface <b>44</b> of the retention lever <b>42</b>, which in turn is pushed towards the shaft <b>10</b> by a spring <b>45</b> via a hinge <b>43</b>. This can be generally referred to as a &#x201c;normally closed&#x201d; position, meaning a position in which the device is continuously engaged with the shaft of the colonoscope unless the release button is depressed. The button <b>45</b> is exposed through a cutout in the external sleeve so that the operator can depress it and release the surface <b>44</b> from the shaft <b>10</b>. When the button <b>45</b> is released, the spring again pushes the lever <b>42</b> towards the shaft surface and the internal sleeve is therefore locked to the colonoscope shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The external sleeve <b>21</b> and the internal sleeve <b>30</b> both have provisions to hold an engaging means <b>50</b> therebetween. Depressions <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> in the internal sleeve <b>36</b> and the external sleeve <b>26</b> respectively are envisioned to hold the engaging means <b>50</b> between the two sleeves. In its preferred configuration, the engaging means <b>50</b> is a flexible steel rectangular bar <b>56</b> with two pairs of strain gages <b>55</b> and <b>54</b> attached to the sides thereof and forming a sensor means capable of measuring perpendicular forces applied to the bar <b>56</b>. Electrical wires carry out the signals from the strain gages <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> and are assembled together in a cable <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The bar <b>56</b> rigidly connects the external sleeve <b>21</b> to the internal sleeve <b>30</b>. The operator holds the external sleeve while the shaft is attached to the internal sleeve. Force applied along the shaft of the colonoscope is measured by the first pair of strain gages while torque is measured by the second one.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In use, the handgrip is first placed over the shaft of the colonoscope by opening the external and internal sleeves and positioning them over the shaft. The internal sleeve is closed first following by the closure of the external sleeve. The device now is ready for force measurement. As the colonoscope is advanced by the operator, the longitudinal force is measured and displayed on the PC or another display device for the operator by having the sensor means recording the force from a first pair of strain gages <b>54</b> (or <b>55</b> depending on the orientation of the bar <b>56</b>). At the same time, the torsion force is measured by the second pair of strain gages and displayed at the same time to the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Provisions can be made to allow operator to set alarm conditions so that when the force or torque reach predetermined limit, the audio or visual alarm signal is generated.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SECOND PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second embodiment of the invention is shown in more detail on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8&#x2013;12</figref>. Note that the engaging means <b>50</b> is not shown. Design of this embodiment is similar to that of the first embodiment. The main difference is that the suspension of the internal sleeve <b>131</b> inside the external sleeve <b>121</b> is done using two spaced apart sets of three ball bearings <b>138</b> and <b>139</b>. Each set has three balls <b>150</b> spaced preferably equally apart along the periphery of the internal sleeve forming these three ball bearings. Each ball <b>150</b> is set in its cavity <b>151</b> inside the external sleeve <b>121</b> and held in place by a retaining plate <b>152</b> while allowing the ball to protrude towards the running plate <b>153</b> on the internal sleeve <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The purpose of the ball bearings in this embodiment is to suspend the internal sleeve inside the external sleeve in a manner so that all torque and force are transmitted from the external to the internal sleeve only by the sensor means and not by friction between the sleeves.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The operation of the second embodiment is the same as that of the first embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE THIRD PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The details of the third embodiment of the invention are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13&#x2013;15</figref>. The main difference is in the design of the release buttons, engaging means, and the internal sleeve suspension means. The release button is made of two symmetrical parts <b>241</b> supported by the springs in a &#x201c;normally closed&#x201d; or engaged position in a manner similar to that described for the first embodiment of the invention. The advantage of this symmetrical arrangement is that the grip of the colonoscope shaft is ensured by levers <b>242</b> compressing the shaft from both sides rather than from one, which avoids slipping. Also, it makes for a better control of the release buttons by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> shows an alternate design of the shaft engaging mechanism comprising a pair of concave and convex levers <b>242</b><i>a </i>and <b>242</b><i>b </i>forming a depression for the colonoscope shaft. In that case, the shaft of the colonoscope is slightly bent when placed in the depression formed by the retaining levers <b>242</b><i>a </i>and <b>242</b><i>b</i>. This further reduces the possibility of inadvertent slipping of the shaft inside the handgrip during manipulations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The engaging means according to the third embodiment is arranged as a combination of radial <b>254</b> and longitudinal <b>255</b> sets of engaging plates. Each plate is equipped with a sensor to measure its deflection as a function of force applied to one side of this plate. Strain gage sensors can be used advantageously for this purpose along with other sensors known in the art. Application of longitudinal force such as for the purpose of advancing the colonoscope would cause the longitudinal set of plates <b>255</b> to bend, which will be detected and recorded by the sensors. Rotation of the shaft will correspondingly cause the radial set of plates <b>254</b> to bend as will be captured by their sensors. Therefore, the entire picture of force and torque application can be accurately monitored. As shown on the drawings, the two sets of plates could be extended to be positioned at the opposite ends of the handgrip but that is not absolutely necessary for the accurate function of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Finally, the internal sleeve support system includes two sets of four ball bearings each, which further reduces the friction component of the force transfer from the external sleeve to the internal sleeve and makes the force measurement more accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> illustrates an alternate design of the engaging means comprising a front and a rear set of four plates <b>255</b><i>a </i>each. In that case, the internal sleeve is supported by plates <b>255</b><i>a </i>at four points in the front and four points in the rear part of the external sleeve, which improves the torque and force measurement results and obviates the need for additional suspension bearings. The release button <b>241</b><i>a </i>is preferably arranged at a 45-degree angle to the planes defined by the plates <b>255</b><i>a </i>so that there is no interaction between the release mechanism and the engaging means of the handgrip.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FOURTH PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The fourth embodiment of the invention is shown schematically on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>. It includes a further modification of the pair of release buttons <b>341</b> now positioned in the center of the grip right under the palm of the operator. The main feature of this release system is that centrally located release buttons <b>341</b> control two sets of levers located opposite each other, one in the front of the handgrip and the other in the back. Therefore, as many as 4 levers grip the shaft of the colonoscope both in the front and in the back, which further reduces the chance of slipping even when the shaft is wet. As in previous embodiments, the springs <b>345</b> support each release button in its engaged or &#x201c;normally closed&#x201d; position making the device disengaging the shaft only when the release buttons <b>341</b> are depressed.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIFTH PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">This embodiment is similar to the previous embodiments with the main difference being the use of an elastic single-use protective sheath <b>400</b> designed to protect the handgrip of the invention <b>20</b> from contamination during use. This additional element (protective sheath <b>400</b>) may be used with all embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> shows the first step in the use of this embodiment illustrating the colonoscope shaft <b>10</b> and a sheath <b>400</b> rolled into a ring. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> shows the ring placed onto the shaft followed by unfurling the sheath over the shaft shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref> shows the handgrip of the invention positioned over the sheath <b>400</b> and thus separated with a thin mechanical barrier from the sterile field of the shaft. Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref> shows the ends of the sheath <b>400</b> folded over the handgrip <b>20</b> to form a complete envelope about it.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows an alternate design of the release button of the handgrip, which can be used with any of the above described embodiments of the invention. In order to reduce the physical force needed for activation of the release button, this design incorporates a pair of front and rear wedges <b>530</b>. The wedges <b>530</b> can be brought closer to each other by a linear actuator <b>500</b> controlled by a button <b>520</b> such that the shaft of the colonoscope is wedged in its current position. When the actuator <b>500</b> releases the wedges <b>530</b> they are pulled apart by the optional return springs <b>510</b> to release the shaft of the colonoscope (not shown) from the handgrip of the invention. Piezoelectric linear actuator can be used as actuator <b>500</b>. Alternately, a small electrical motor driving a worm gear set can also be used for that purpose.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to materials designed to withstand high temperatures. More particularly, this invention relates to heat-resistant alloys for high-temperature applications, such as, for instance, gas turbine engine components of aircraft engines and power generation equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is a continuing demand in many industries, notably in the aircraft engine and power generation industries where efficiency directly relates to operating temperature, for alloys that exhibit sufficient levels of strength and oxidation resistance at increasingly higher temperatures. Gas turbine airfoils on such components as vanes and blades are usually made of materials known in the art as &#x201c;superalloys.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;superalloy&#x201d; is usually intended to embrace iron-, cobalt-, or nickel-based alloys, which include one or more additional elements to enhance high temperature performance, including such non-limiting examples as aluminum, tungsten, molybdenum, titanium, and iron. The term &#x201c;based&#x201d; as used in, for example, &#x201c;nickel-based superalloy&#x201d; is widely accepted in the art to mean that the element upon which the alloy is &#x201c;based&#x201d; is the single largest elemental component by weight in the alloy composition. Generally recognized to have service capabilities limited to a temperature of about 1100&#xb0; C., conventional superalloys used in gas turbine airfoils often operate at the upper limits of their practical service temperature range. In typical jet engines, for example, bulk average airfoil temperatures range between about 900&#xb0; C. to about 1000&#xb0; C., while airfoil leading and trailing edge and tip temperatures can reach about 1150&#xb0; C. or more. At such elevated temperatures, the oxidation process consumes conventional superalloy parts, forming a weak, brittle metal oxide that is prone to chip or spall away from the part. Maximum temperatures are expected in future applications to be over about 1300&#xb0; C., at which point many conventional superalloys begin to melt. Clearly, new materials must be developed if the efficiency enhancements available at higher operating temperatures are to be exploited.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The so-called &#x201c;refractory superalloys,&#x201d; as described in Koizumi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,470, represent a class of alloys designed to operate at higher temperatures than those of conventional superalloys. According to Koizumi et al., refractory superalloys consist essentially of a primary constituent selected from the group consisting of iridium (Ir), rhodium (Rh), and a mixture thereof, and one or more additive elements selected from the group consisting of niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), hafnium (Hf), zirconium (Zr), uranium (U), vanadium (V), titanium (Ti), and aluminum (Al). The refractory superalloys have a microstructure containing an FCC (face-centered cubic)-type crystalline structure phase and an L1<sub>2 </sub>type crystalline structure phase, and the one or more additive elements are present in a total amount within the range of from 2 atom % to 22 atom %.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the refractory superalloys have shown potential to become replacements for conventional superalloys in present and future gas turbine engine designs, it has been shown that many alloys of this class do not meet all of the desired performance criteria for high-temperature applications. Therefore, the need persists for alloys with improved high-temperature properties.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides several embodiments that address this need. One embodiment is an alloy comprising

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0025">The discussion herein employs examples taken from the gas turbine industry, particularly the portions of the gas turbine industry concerned with the design, manufacture, operation, and repair of aircraft engines and power generation turbines. However, the scope of the invention is not limited to only these specific industries, as the embodiments of the present invention are applicable to many and various applications that require materials resistant to high temperature and aggressive environments. Unless otherwise noted, the temperature range of interest where statements and comparisons are made concerning material properties is from about 1000&#xb0; C. to about 1300&#xb0; C. The term &#x201c;high temperature&#x201d; as used herein refers to temperatures above about 1000&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0026">In several high temperature applications, such as, for example, gas turbines, the selection of structural materials is made based upon the performance of materials for a number of different properties. For gas turbine components, including, for example, turbine blades (also known as &#x201c;buckets&#x201d;) and vanes (also known as &#x201c;nozzles&#x201d;), where the maximum metal temperatures typically range from about 1000&#xb0; C. to over about 1200&#xb0; C. in present systems and temperatures over about 1300&#xb0; C. are envisioned for future applications, the properties that are considered include, for example, oxidation resistance, melting temperature (the temperature at which liquid metal begins to form as the material is heated), strength, coefficient of thermal expansion, modulus of elasticity, and cost.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0027">The term &#x201c;oxidation resistance&#x201d; is used in the art to refer to the amount of damage sustained by a material when exposed to oxidizing environments, such as, for example, high temperature gases containing oxygen. Oxidation resistance is related to the rate at which the weight of a specimen changes per unit surface area during exposure at a given temperature. In many cases, the weight change is measured to be a net loss in weight as metal is converted to oxide that later detaches and falls away from the surface. In other cases, a specimen may gain weight if the oxide tends to adhere to the specimen, or if the oxide forms within the specimen, underneath the surface, a condition called &#x201c;internal oxidation.&#x201d; A material is said to have &#x201c;higher&#x201d; or &#x201c;greater&#x201d; oxidation resistance than another if the material's rate of weight change per unit surface area is closer to zero than that of the other material for exposure to the same environment and temperature. Numerically, oxidation resistance can be represented by the time over which an oxidation test was run divided by the absolute value of the weight change per unit area.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0028">&#x201c;Strength&#x201d; as used herein refers to the ultimate tensile strength of a material, which is defined in the art to mean the maximum load sustained by a specimen in a standard tensile test divided by the original cross-sectional area (i.e., the cross-sectional area of the specimen prior to applying the load).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0029">Coefficient of thermal expansion (&#x3b1;) is the change in unit length exhibited by a specimen of material per degree change in temperature. Modulus of elasticity (E) is the ratio of tensile stress divided by tensile strain for elastic deformation. These two quantities are considered in turbine material design and selection because the product of these two quantities is proportional to the amount of elastic stress generated between joined materials of differing thermal expansion coefficients. Therefore, to minimize stresses, the product of E and &#x3b1; (herein referred to as &#x201c;E-alpha factor&#x201d;) is kept as low as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0030">Refractory superalloys, with their high content of highly environmentally resistant elements such as iridium and rhodium, represent a class of materials with potential for use in high temperature applications. However, as the data in Table 1 indicate, several refractory superalloys with compositions according to aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,470 do not approach the oxidation resistance of a standard nickel-based superalloy at a temperature of about 1200&#xb0; C.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0032">In refractory superalloy systems, oxidation resistance is primarily derived from the presence of certain metals selected from the so-called &#x201c;platinum group&#x201d; in the FCC phase. The platinum group comprises platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir), rhenium (Re), ruthenium (Ru), and osmium (Os). Where the primary constituent of a refractory superalloy is rhodium, iridium, or mixtures thereof, strength is primarily derived by the addition of elements that promote the formation of the L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase. Because the L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase usually forms in these alloys by a precipitation mechanism from the supersaturated FCC (&#x201c;matrix&#x201d;) phase, the elements that promote the formation of the L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase are referred to herein as &#x201c;precipitate strengthening metals.&#x201d; Such metals include, for example, zirconium (Zr), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), titanium (Ti), hafnium (Hf), and mixtures thereof. The L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase has a generic chemical formula of M<sub>3</sub>X, where M is a platinum group metal and X is a precipitate strengthening metal. As the proportion of precipitate strengthening metal in the alloy increases, the volume fraction of L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase increases, which increases the strength of the alloy. However, as the volume fraction of L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase increases, the amount of platinum group metal present in the FCC matrix phase to provide oxidation resistance decreases&#x2014;it is &#x201c;tied up&#x201d; in the L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase. Refractory superalloys, therefore, sacrifice a certain amount of oxidation resistance to enhance strength.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0033">In contrast to the refractory superalloys of Koizumi et al., certain embodiments of the present invention are alloys that are essentially free of the L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase at a temperature greater than about 1000&#xb0; C., and so the oxidation-resistant elements present are not significantly tied up in precipitate phases. The term &#x201c;essentially free of the L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase&#x201d; as used herein means that an alloy microstructure contains less than about 5 volume percent of the L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase. Formulation of alloys for high-temperature use is dependent upon an understanding of the property requirements needed for particular applications, and the relationship between alloy composition and properties. Some embodiments of the present invention represent a specific &#x201c;window&#x201d; of composition based upon such an understanding.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0034">One embodiment of the present invention is an alloy comprising rhodium, platinum, and palladium, wherein the alloy comprises a microstructure that is essentially free of L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase at a temperature greater than about 1000&#xb0; C. Some physical properties of these three elements, along with those of nickel (Ni) for comparison, are given in Table 2.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0036">Each of the elements platinum, palladium, and rhodium have a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, and are soluble in each other such that the FCC structure is maintained even when the three elements are mixed to form alloys. In terms of oxidation resistance, at a temperature of about 1300&#xb0; C. and using the oxidation resistance of Pt as a baseline, Rh is about 2.5 times as resistant, and Pd is about 60% as resistant. By comparison, Ir is only about 2% as resistant as Pt at this temperature, and nickel-based superalloys are close to or past their incipient melting points (i.e., the lowest temperature at which localized melting of the alloy occurs) and thus are very susceptible to oxidation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0037">The alloy embodiments of the present invention represent formulations designed to balance the properties of the resulting alloy, by carefully controlling the alloy composition, such that the alloy has properties that are acceptable for use in a high temperature application, for example, a gas turbine engine. The formulation of such an alloy comprising Pt, Pd, and Rh represents an optimization driven by a series of compromises. For example, Pd is the least expensive element of the three, so an alloy that is relatively rich in Pd is less expensive than an alloy that is relatively lean in Pd. However, Pd also has the lowest oxidation resistance of the three elements, and so the advantageous cost of the Pd-rich alloys is offset by reduced oxidation resistance. Embodiments of the present invention have been formulated using an analysis of this and several other alloy property trade-offs. The factors considered during the analysis included, for example, oxidation resistance, strength, cost, E-alpha factor, ease of alloy processing, reliability of joint between the alloy and a typical nickel-based superalloy (i.e., the ability to form a joint with acceptable strength and microstructure), and amount of diffusion interaction between the alloy and a nickel-based superalloy substrate. These last two factors are considered because in certain embodiments of the present invention, the alloy is in direct contact with gas turbine airfoil materials, such as, for example, nickel-based superalloys, and thus the reliability of the joint is one of several important factors. The amount of diffusion interaction with a nickel-based superalloy structure is also one of several important factors in these embodiments, where the amount of interaction is desired to be as low as possible to avoid significantly changing the local alloy chemistry at the interface between the alloy of the present invention and the nickel-based alloy. If such a change occurs, low-melting-point phases may form which will severely degrade the performance of the overall component. For the alloy of the present invention, one interaction that is considered potentially detrimental is that between palladium and nickel, where incorporation of 10 atomic percent Pd into nickel, for example, reduces the melting point by over 100&#xb0; C. In addition, elements diffusing from the airfoil material into the alloy of the present invention will lower the inherent oxidation resistance of the alloy. Those skilled in the art will appreciate, therefore, that the need to mitigate the diffusion interaction property enhances the appeal of keeping the Pd concentration in the alloy as low as the combination of desired properties will allow.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0038">In certain embodiments, the alloy of the present invention has an oxidation resistance of at least about 16 hour-cm2/mg at a temperature of about 1200&#xb0; C., which is at least about as high as the oxidation resistance of the baseline nickel-based superalloy in Table 1. Certain embodiments are provided in which the alloy has an ultimate tensile strength greater than about 100 megapascals (MPa) at a temperature of about 1200&#xb0; C., and in some embodiments, the alloy has an E-alpha factor less than about 3.6 MPa/&#xb0; C. at a temperature of about 1000&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0039">Certain embodiments of the present invention provide that the alloy of the present invention further comprises a metal selected from the group consisting of zirconium, hafnium, titanium, and mixtures thereof, and in some embodiments, the alloy comprises from about 0 atomic percent to about 5 atomic percent of a metal selected from the group consisting of zirconium, hafnium, titanium, and mixtures thereof, herein referred to as &#x201c;strengtheners&#x201d;. Particular embodiments provide that the metal comprises zirconium. In the alloys of the present invention, these elements serve to improve alloy strength, but not by forming the L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase of the refractory superalloys. The amount of strengtheners added to the alloys of the present invention is controlled to be below the solubility limit at about 1000&#xb0; C. for these elements in the FCC Pt&#x2014;Rh&#x2014;Pd solid solution. Controlling the amount of strengtheners in this way ensures that the alloys of the present invention remain essentially free of L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase at a temperature greater than about 1000&#xb0; C. The strengthening is instead achieved through solid solution strengthening, wherein the strengthening element remains dissolved in the FCC phase and hardens the FCC phase by straining the surrounding FCC crystal structure. Additionally, as an alloy of the present invention comprising strengtheners is exposed to high-temperature service conditions, the strengtheners oxidize to form a uniform dispersion of very small, very hard oxide particles that reinforce the FCC alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0040">In some embodiments, the alloy of the present invention further comprises from about 0 atomic percent to about 5 atomic percent ruthenium. This element has been found to enhance the ability of high temperature alloys to resist both internal and external oxidation, when present in an amount consistent with the above composition range.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0057">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that additions of carbon and boron to the embodiments of the present invention may marginally improve strength and other properties as they do in many other alloy systems, and that such additions are generally up to about 0.25 atomic percent for each of these two elements. Furthermore, incidental impurities, such as nickel, cobalt, chromium, iron, and other metals, are often present in processed alloys and may be present in alloys provided by the present invention in amounts of up to about 0.5 atomic percent, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0058">Other embodiments of the present invention provide an alloy comprising from about 5 atomic percent to about 40 atomic percent platinum and the balance comprising rhodium (herein referred to as a &#x201c;Rh&#x2014;Pt alloy&#x201d;), wherein the alloy further comprises a microstructure that is essentially free of L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase at a temperature greater than about 1000&#xb0; C. The alternatives for properties and the presence of strengtheners and ruthenium, as described for above embodiments, are also applicable to this embodiment. In certain embodiments, the alloy comprises from about 5 atomic percent to about 30 atomic percent platinum and the balance comprises rhodium, and in particular embodiments, the alloy comprises from about 5 atomic percent to about 10 atomic percent platinum; and the balance comprises rhodium. Certain embodiments provide an alloy consisting essentially of from about 5 atomic percent to about 40 atomic percent platinum; from about 0 atomic percent to about 5 atomic percent of a metal selected from the group consisting of zirconium, hafnium, titanium, and mixtures thereof; from about 0 atomic percent to about 5 atomic percent ruthenium; and the balance rhodium; wherein said alloy comprises a microstructure that is essentially free of L1<sub>2</sub>-structured phase at a temperature greater than about 1000&#xb0; C. The Rh&#x2014;Pt alloy compositions described are optimized to provide a high level of oxidation resistance and strength, suitable for use in a high-temperature application, for example, a gas turbine engine component.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0059">Another embodiment of the present invention provides a gas turbine engine component comprising the alloy of the present invention. The alternatives for composition and properties of the alloy in these gas turbine engine component embodiments are the same as discussed above for the alloy embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0060">In some embodiments, the gas turbine engine component is a blade of an aircraft engine, a vane of an aircraft engine, a bucket of a power generation turbine engine, or a nozzle of a power generation turbine. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in particular embodiments the gas turbine engine component comprises an airfoil <b>10</b>, and the airfoil comprises the alloy. Specific embodiments provide that the airfoil <b>10</b> comprises a tip section <b>11</b>, a leading edge section <b>12</b>, and a trailing edge section <b>13</b>, and wherein at least one of said tip section <b>11</b>, said leading edge section <b>12</b>, and said trailing edge section <b>13</b> comprises said alloy. Having only particular sections (i.e., those sections known to experience the most aggressive stress-temperature combinations) of the airfoil comprise the alloy of the present invention minimizes certain drawbacks of alloys comprising significant amounts of rhodium, platinum, or palladium, including their high cost and high density in comparison to conventional airfoil materials. These drawbacks have a reduced effect on the overall component because the rhodium-based high temperature alloy comprises only a fraction of the overall surface area of the component. The properties of the component are thus &#x201c;tailored&#x201d; to the expected localized environments, reducing the need for compromise during the design process and increasing the expected operating lifetimes for new and repaired components. As described above, E-alpha factor and diffusion interaction are considered to be two of several important factors in the selection of a suitable alloy for embodiments where the alloy is to comprise only particular sections of a gas turbine component, because the alloy is to be in direct contact with a nickel-based alloy as in, for example, a coating or a brazed or welded joint.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0061">Alloys set forth herein as embodiments of the present invention are made using any of the various traditional methods of metal production and forming. Traditional casting, powder metallurgical processing, directional solidification, and single-crystal solidification are non-limiting examples of methods suitable for forming ingots of these alloys. Thermal and thermo-mechanical processing techniques common in the art for the formation of other alloys are suitable for use in manufacturing and strengthening the alloys of the present invention. For embodiments where the alloy of the present invention comprises strengtheners, the alloy may be given a heat-treatment in air at a temperature suitable to form a dispersion of oxide particles as described above. For situations where alloys of the present invention are joined to a Ni-base superalloy or other conventional material, heat treatments are limited to temperatures below those that will degrade or melt the conventional material.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0063">Several alloys with compositions according to embodiments of the present invention were prepared for an oxidation test to be run for 100 hours at a temperature of about 1300&#xb0; C. The tested compositions are presented in Table 3. The test specimens were cylindrical pins with a diameter of about 2.5 mm and length of about 30 mm. After exposure, the diameter of each pin was measured and the change in radius was used as a measure of oxidation resistance. Each of the alloys tested registered a radius change of less than about 0.003 mm. For comparison, a similar specimen of a single crystal nickel-based superalloy, tested at a significantly lower temperature (about 1200&#xb0; C.) to avoid incipient melting, registered a radius change of about 0.03 mm.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/477,147, filed Jun. 9, 2003, entitled &#x201c;FUSED ZIRCONIA-BASED SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL,&#x201d; naming inventor Oh-Hun Kwon, which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to novel solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In pursuit of high-efficiency, environmentally friendly energy production, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technologies have emerged as a potential alternative to conventional turbine and combustion engines. Fuel cell technologies typically have a higher efficiency and have lower CO and NOx emissions than traditional combustion engines. In addition, fuel cell technologies tend to be quiet and vibration-fee. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have an advantage over other fuel cell varieties. For example, SOFCs may use fuel sources such as natural gas, propane, methanol, kerosene, and diesel, among others because SOFCs operate at high enough operating temperatures to allow for internal fuel reformation. However, challenges exist in reducing the cost of SOFC systems to be competitive with combustion engines and other fuel cell technologies. These challenges include lowering the cost of materials, improving degradation or life cycle, and improving operation characteristics such as current and power density.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical SOFC has an electrolyte made from an expensive, high-purity, chemically co-precipitated stabilized zirconia. Chemically co-precipitated stabilized zirconia may also be used in a porous support tube structure or doped with nickel to produce a fuel electrode (anode). Other expensive materials such as doped lanthanum manganite have been proposed as an air electrode (cathode). The cathode can also be made of a composite of doped lanthanum manganite and stabilized zirconia.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to the cost of materials, conductivity degradation in the electrolyte should be considered. Typically, chemically co-precipitated stabilized zirconia-based electrolytes degrade at a rate as high as 0.5 percent per thousand hours of operation. This degradation has been attributed to gradual changes in the crystalline structure of the solid electrolyte and/or reaction with impurities. Degradation may also occur through on-and-off cycling. On-and-off cycling cycles temperatures, creating temperature differences between components during cooling and reheating. Even small differences in expansion coefficients among various components of an SOFC lead to cracks, flaws, and separations during cycling. These cracks, flaws and separations degrade conductivity and increase resistivity between components. Lost conductivity, increases in resistivity, and degradation of contact surface also lead to a reduction in operating voltages and current densities. As a solid electrolyte degrades, its resistance increases, detracting from the potential of the fuel cell. In addition, increases in resistance in the electrolytes, electrodes or interconnects reduce the power output. As a result of degradation, the expensive fuel cell components are replaced more frequently, leading to higher overall energy costs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As such, many typical fuel cell systems suffer from deficiencies in providing a low cost alternative to other energy sources. In view of the foregoing, it is considered generally desirable to provide an improved SOFC having electrode and electrolyte materials having suitable properties for use in demanding SOFC applications.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one particular embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) including a layer formed of fused material. For example, the SOFC may include an electrolyte formed of fused, doped zirconia powder, such as fused, stabilized zirconia. In another exemplary embodiment, the SOFC may further include a conductivity agent, such as nickel, iron, cobalt, and other transition metals. A solid oxide fuel cell stack may be formed of a plurality of SOFCs.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an exemplary SOFC. The SOFC has two electrodes <b>102</b> and <b>106</b>, and an electrolyte <b>104</b>. The anode <b>102</b> overlies the electrolyte <b>104</b>. The electrolyte <b>104</b> overlies the cathode <b>106</b>. In operation, oxygen ions are transported across the electrolyte <b>104</b> to react with incoming fuel. This ion transport produces an electrical potential between the anode <b>102</b> and the cathode <b>106</b>. In more detail, oxygen-containing gas enters through a cathode and diffuses to a cathode/electrolyte interface. Fuel diffuses through an anode to an anode/electrolyte interface. Oxygen ions are transported across the electrolyte from the cathode interface to the anode interface, where the oxygen ions react with the fuel. Multiple SOFCs as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be stacked on top of each other to form a solid oxide fuel cell stack.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another embodiment, the electrode of the solid oxide fuel cell is formed of a fused material, such as a fused powder. Alternatively or additionally, a fused powder may be used to form an interconnect.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Fused material may take various forms including a wide range of oxide and non-oxide materials. Oxide materials, in particular, include doped and undoped zirconia, ceria, and gallia. The zirconia and ceria materials may be stabilized with various oxides including oxides of yttrium, scandium, samarium, ytterbium and gadolinium. In one specific embodiment, a fused electrolyte powder may be yttria-stabilized zirconia with at least about 8 mole percent yttria and may be formed through an arc melting or fusion process. For example, the yttria-stabilized zirconia may include at least about 8.5 mole percent yttria, at least about 9 mole percent yttria, at least about 9.5 mole percent yttria, or at least about 10 mole percent yttria. In another embodiment, the fused electrolyte powder may be 10 mole percent yttria-stabilized zirconia formed through an arc melting or fusion process.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The fused electrode material may take similar forms to that of the fused electrolyte material. For example, a component of electrode material may be a stabilized zirconia, stabilized with approximately 8 to 10 mole percent yttria, and be formed using an arc melting or fusion process. The fused electrode material may contain conductivity agents, such as metals and metal oxides, such as nickel. In this case, nickel oxide may be mixed with fused powder, which is processed to for sintered, fused electrodes, the nickel oxide being reduced to nickel in a reducing atmosphere. Reduction of the nickel oxide may not only provide desirable conductivity in the resulting electrode, but also desirable porosity for fuel and/or oxygen migration to the electrolyte surface.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Fused powder tends to have a greater amount of impurities than more expensive chemical precipitation powder. In general, the impurities of fused powders may be less than about 2% or less than about 1% by weight. However, in some embodiments, the impurities may be greater than about 0.2%, 0.5%, 0.7%, or 1% and as high as 2% or higher, but generally less than 5% by weight. The impurities may include inert components, such as alumina, that have limited influence on the properties of the electrolyte, electrode, or interconnect. The percentages of impurities will vary depending on the inclusion of inert components.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An exemplary electrolyte may be formed using a tape-casting method with an organic binder. The electrolyte may then be densified by sintering, which includes pressureless sintering, hot pressing, hot isostatically pressing, hot uniaxially pressing, or hot forging. The electrolyte may be co-formed with the balance of an SOFC or SOFC stack, such as by co-sintering, and preferably co-hot pressing so as to form a cell or stack in one densification step. The resulting electrolyte is durable with a reasonable ionic conductivity at least about 0.05 S/cm, such as at least about 0.10 S/cm or at least about 0.12 S/cm. In one exemplary embodiment, the electrical conductivity is not greater than about 0.5 S/cm, such as not greater than about 0.3 S/cm or not greater than about 0.2 S/cm. For example, the ionic conductivity may be between about 0.12 S/cm and about 0.2 S/cm. Moreover, the electrolyte conductivity degrades at not more than about 2.5%, such as not more than about 2.0%, not more than about 0.5%, not more than about 0.2%, or not more than about 0.1% per 1,000 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The electrolyte may be used in a solid oxide fuel cell having an anode and a cathode, as already described above. The solid oxide fuel cell including the electrolyte may be included in a stack of solid oxide fuel cells, and may include 3 or more cells, such as at least 4 cells, but may include 10, 50 or greater than 100 fuel cells, among various configurations.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A batch of arc-melted and air-quenched crude including 10 mole percent yttria stabilized zirconia (Sample 1) was milled to an average particle size of approximately 0.6 micrometers by an attrition mill using yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (Y-TZP) milling media, followed by a spray drying.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The spray-dried powder was mixed with an organic binder in solvent and tape cast to form thin tapes of approximately 0.4 millimeters thick. Some spray-dried powder was cold isostatically pressed into rectangular tiles at 207 MPa, resulting in a green density of about 55% of theoretical density. In parallel, green tiles were also pressed using a chemically co-precipitated powder having 8 mole percent yttria, TZ8Y, available from Tosoh.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The flexible green tape of yttria-stabilized zirconia was cut into bar or disk shapes with a laser machine. The green bars and disks were sintered on zirconia setter plates in a furnace with an increasing temperature at a rate of 100&#xb0; C. per hour to 1,500&#xb0; C. and held at 1,500&#xb0; C. for one hour, followed by a cooling by power shutdown. The sintered density was higher than 98% of theoretical density.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A 4-probe electrical conductivity test was used to determine the electrical conductivity of the sintered yttria-stabilized zirconia samples. Commercially available platinum paste was used to establish electrical contacts. The samples were then baked at 900&#xb0; C. for high temperature measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The electrolyte from the 10 mole percent yttria-stabilized zirconia fused powder showed a negligible degradation at 1,000&#xb0; C. for 1,000 hours, compared to a significant degradation of the TZ8Y sample. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> over long term, the 10 mole percent yttria-stabilized fused powder maintains a higher conductivity and lower degradation rate than the TZ8Y sample from chemically co-precipitated powder.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A 1000 hour test was conducted on exemplary samples of fused 10 mol % yttria-stabilized zirconia (Sample 2) and 10 mol % chemically co-precipitated yttria-stabilized zirconia. The 10 mol % chemically co-precipitated yttria-stabilized zirconia is labeled TZ10Y, the raw material powder from Tosoh company.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A 4-probe electrical conductivity test was used to determine the electrical conductivity of the sintered yttria-stabilized zirconia samples. Electrolyte bar samples of each of the respective samples were subjected to voltage testing every 10 minutes for 1000 hours at 1000&#xb0; C. using a 1 mA current. Platinum wires (Diameter=0.2 mm) were fixed with Platinum paste (TR7905/Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.) to each bar to form electrodes. The wire and the paste were dried at 100&#xb0; C. during 5 hours then sintered at 1000&#xb0; C. during 5 hours (300&#xb0; C./h).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the conductivities of both samples are almost constant in time. The TZ10Y average conductivity is around 0.145 S.cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and the fused electrolyte sample (Sample 2) shows an average conductivity around 0.130 S.cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. Thus, the conductivity of TZ10Y sample is 10% higher than the fused Sample 2.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For each sample the conductivity degradation as a function of time has been calculated and is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The results indicate a slight slope break after 340 hours for both samples. The TZ10Y electrolyte and the fused Sample 2 electrolyte show a slight decrease. This degradation was probably caused by a temperature deviation. Prior to the change, the temperature suddenly increased to 1004&#xb0; C. and likely modified the conductivity of the samples. After the deviation, the temperature returned to 1000&#xb0; C. Later, the deviation started again and increased continuously to reach 1010&#xb0; C. at the end of the test. After the slope break, the degradation remained constant. The overall average degradation rates for TZ10Y and Sample 2 are 2.8% and 2.4%, respectively. However, for extended periods, such as beyond 600 hours, the degradation was negligible, such as not greater than about 0.1% per 1000 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While, the fused powder-based samples may exhibit a similar degradation profile to chemically co-precipitated powder-based samples having an equivalent doping of stabilizing agents, Sample 1 shows superior performance and the fused powder is less expensive and therefore more cost effective than chemically co-precipitated powders. In addition, slower average degradation rates for the Sample 2 may lead to better conductivity in SOFCs during longer SOFC use, such as 50,000 hours or more.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The solid oxide fuel cells described above may be incorporated into a SOFC system for producing power. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts an exemplary SOFC system. The system includes a fuel system <b>502</b>, an air system <b>504</b>, a SOFC stack <b>508</b>, and a power conditioner <b>510</b>. The system may also include a reformer <b>506</b> depending on the expected operating temperature of the SOFC stack.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Fuel enters the fuel system <b>502</b>. The fuel system <b>502</b> may clean the fuel and/or heat the fuel in preparation for reforming or reaction. The fuel system <b>502</b> may include heat exchangers, compressors, pumps, absorption beds, and other components. From the fuel system <b>502</b>, the fuel enters a reformer <b>506</b>. The reformer <b>506</b> may use the fuel to produce hydrogen and other molecules. The reformer <b>506</b> is typically used for low temperature SOFC systems. High temperature SOFC systems may have the advantage of internal reforming and thus utilize unreformed fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Air enters the air system <b>504</b>. The air system <b>504</b> may clean, compress, purify, and/or heat the air. The air system may include compressors, absorption beds, membranes, and heat exchangers, among other components.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The fuel and air are directed to the SOFC stack <b>508</b>. The fuel is typically directed across the anodes of the fuel cells in the SOFC stack and the air is typically directed across the cathodes. In the case of SOFCs, oxygen ion transport across the electrolyte from the cathode to the anode produces an electric potential. This electric potential is conditioned with a power conditioner <b>510</b> that is electrically coupled to the SOFC stack <b>508</b>. The power conditioner <b>510</b> may deliver power to a grid or circuitry. Exhaust from the SOFC stack may be used for heat exchange or in the reformation process.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the National Phase of International Application PCT/GB00/00278 filed Feb. 1, 2000 which designated the U.S. and that International Application was published under PCT Article 21(2) in English.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention concerns safe non-interacting drug combinations of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG&#x2014;CoA) reductase inhibitor, which is (E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimindin-5-yl] (3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (the Agent) and a drug which is either an inducer, inhibitor or a substrate of cytochrome P450, in particular cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4. Particular combinations are useful in treating hyperlipidaemia in humans who are receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy. A preferred combination is the Agent and a fibrate drug, the use of such a combination in treating hyperlipidaemia in mammals, and medicaments containing such a combination for use in such treatments.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hypercholesterolaemia is one of the strongest risk factors for atherosclerosis which is associated with coronary artery disease (including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and mortality), stroke (including cerebro vascular accident and transient ischaemic attack) and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Several types of hypercholesterolaemia exist. The magnitude of hypercholesterolaemia may have consequences for the therapy, but in general, any reduction of elevated plasma cholesterol levels is generally accepted to result in an improvement of the risk profile. Dietary improvement and increased exercise are essential first steps and should continue even if drug therapy is instituted, but the therapeutic potential of drug therapy is significantly larger. Several types of drug therapy for hypercholesterolaemia are currently available. Guidelines exist for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia for example, American Heart Association (AHA) (Anon 1988), Updated Sheffield treatment tables (Heart (1998) 80 Supp. 2 S1&#x2013;S29) and Recommendations of the task force of the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines (Pyorala 1994).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are the most widely used prescription medication for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. By inhibiting the rate-controlling step in cholesterol biosynthesis, these agents effectively lower the plasma concentrations of atherogenic particles containing cholesterol such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-C). Partial inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis causes up-regulation of hepatic membrane LDL-C receptors which are responsible for the clearance of LDL-C from the circulation. In addition, reduced hepatic synthesis of cholesterol is thought to result in a modest reduction in the secretion of VLDL-C particles by the liver. Clinical trials with certain HMG Co A-reductase inhibitors, such as in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, confirm a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with such agents, and may even promote regression of atherosclerotic vascular lesions. Various HMG Co A-reductase inhibitors are marketed, and are collectively referred to as &#x2018;statins&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite the impressive benefits of statin therapy, less than optimal therapeutic results may be achieved in some subjects, particularly in the more severe classes of hypercholesterolaemia. This can be due to the occurrence of reversible increases in liver transaminase levels at higher dose levels of statins as well as differences in efficacy between different statins. Clinically important (&#x3e;3 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) have been reported for atorvastatin in 0.8 percent of patients at low doses of atorvastatin and higher at raised doses (European Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC] for atorvastatin [Lipitor&#x2122;]). In all cases the effect is dose-related and reversible. In general it is the incidence of ALT increases which limits dose escalation of statins rather than a limit to further increases in efficacy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The first generation statins (such as lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin&#x2014;prodrug derivatives of fungal metabolites&#x2014;and fluvastatin) are categorised in that they achieve only a limited cholesterol lowering affect before the dose administered is limited by elevations in serum ALT. Second generation &#x201c;superstatins&#x201d; (such as atorvastatin&#x2014;synthetic compounds&#x2014;structurally distinct from first generation compounds) inhibitors are categorised in that they lower cholesterol levels to a much higher degree than the earlier first generation of statins before their dose is limited by serum ALT levels. Atorvastatin has been successful over the first generation of statins. Since its launch in the USA atorvastatin has reached sales in 1998, doubling from 1997, of $2.2 billion, capturing 38% of new prescriptions for cholesterol-lowering agents in the US and is now the most widely prescribed hypolipidaemic agent in the US (Warner-Lambert 1998 annual results).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An additional adverse event, reported for statins in general, is myopathy, defined as symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness and weakness, with creatinine kinase (CK) values&#x3e;10&#xd7; Upper Limit of Normal (ULN). This adverse event is not considered to be dose related, and in addition the adverse events are potentially more serious, and consequently more problematical. In severe cases this can lead to rhabdomyolysis, which is a rare life threatening condition sometimes associated with renal failure. The incidence of raised CK levels (&#x3e;10&#xd7;ULN&#x2212;on 2 occasions at least 1 week apart with symptoms=myositis according to FDA) for statins has been reported as 3.1 percent. (SmPC for atorvastatin). Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been particularly associated with taking a statin in combination with gemfibrozil, niacin, cyclosporin or erythromycin, (Hunninghake H. Et al. Current Opinion in Lipidolgy (1992), 3, 22&#x2013;28) which are all substrates for P450 isoenzyme 3A4. The increase in adverse events associated with taking a combination of a statin drug with one of the other drugs mentioned above is probably due to a drug:drug interaction likely related to the metabolism of most statins also by the same cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4. Therefore when a drug which is also metabolised by P450 3A4 is administered alongside a statin which also is metabolised by P450 3A4, the side effects discussed above are more likely to occur. Increase in the side effects, such as muscle damage, is thought to be due to elevated statin levels in muscle cells inhibiting farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of muscle proteins. Elevated levels of statins may be caused by any drug which affects P450 3A4. Therefore, currently on the labels of all commercially available statins the use of the statin in combination with drugs that are metabolised by P450 3A4 is not recommended and is contraindicated in certain cases.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Nearly all drugs are metabolised to some degree in the human, generally to a less lipid soluble compound which is more easily excreted by the kidney or in liver bile. The liver is the major site of drug metabolism and many drug metabolising enzymes occur at high concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum (which form microsomes upon homogenisation) of liver parenchymal cells (hepatocytes). Cytochrome P450 represents a major class of drug metabolising enzymes and exists as a family of isoenzymes found in hepatic microsomes. Six specific P450 isoenzymes are responsible for the metabolism of most of the commonly used drugs, namely P450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A major disadvantage of the currently available &#x201c;super statin&#x201d;, atorvastatin, is that atorvastatin is metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes, in particular 3A4, which may cause drug interactions with other drugs which are inducers, inhibitors or substrates of the same P450 enzyme which metabolises atorvastatin. All of the first generation of statins are metabolised by P450 also. However, the rate of metabolism of pravastatin is sufficiently low that it is considered less susceptible to clinically relevant drug interactions. Therefore despite the lower efficacy of pravastatin, in its currently available doses, at reducing hypercholesterolaemia this is currently the statin of choice in combination with other drugs where the possibility of drug interactions is unacceptably high.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">(E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (the calcium salt of which is disclosed in FIG. 1 below), hereinafter referred to as the Agent, is also a statin and belongs to the class of what is now starting to be called a &#x201c;superstatin&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The Agent is disclosed in European Patent Application, Publication No. 0521471, and in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, (1997), 5(2), 437&#x2013;444 as an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase which is a major rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. The Agent is described as useful in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, hyperlipoproteinaemia and atherosclerosis.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The Agent is not metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 and therefore does not possess the same potential for drug interaction shared with the currently available &#x201c;super statin&#x201d;, i.e. atorvastatin, or any of the other currently available statins.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore we present as a feature of the invention a non-interacting drug combination comprising a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, which is the Agent, and a drug which is an inhibitor, inducer or substrate of P450 in particular, isoenzyme 3A4.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As a further feature of the invention we present use of a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, which is the Agent, in the preparation of a medicament for use in combination therapy with a drug which is an inhibitor, inducer or substrate of P450, in particular, isoenzyme 3A4.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As a further feature of the invention we present use of a drug which is an inhibitor, inducer or substrate of P450, in particular, isoenzyme 3A4 in the preparation of a medicament for use in combination therapy with a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, which is the Agent.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As a further feature of the invention we present a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the Agent, a drug which is an inducer, inhibitor or substrate of P450 isoenzyme 3A4 and a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent, carrier or adjuvant.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As a further feature of the invention we present a pharmacy pack comprising a first drug which is the Agent and a second drug which is an inducer, inhibitor or substrate of P450 isoenzyme 4A4.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">By the term &#x201c;inducer of P450 &#x201d; we mean a drug which increases the rate at which a P450 enzyme, in particular isoenzyme 3A4, metabolises a substrate, for example by increasing the activity of the P450 enzyme, decreasing the rate of biological inactivation of the P450 enzyme or by increasing the rate of transcription of the P450 gene.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">By the term &#x201c;inhibitor of P450&#x201d; we mean a drug which lowers the rate at which a P450 enzyme, in particular isoenzyme 3A4, metabolises a substrate, for example by lowering the activity of the P450 enzyme or by lowering the rate of transcription of the P450 gene.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">By the term &#x201c;substrate of P450&#x201d; we mean a drug which is metabolised by a P450 enzyme, in particular isoenzyme 3A4.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">By the term &#x201c;non-interacting drug combination&#x201d; we mean a drug combination for which there is no adverse affect to the patient by its administration through the mechanism of drug metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4. It is recognised that in certain instances a drug interaction may nevertheless occur between two such drugs when in combination through a completely different mechanism not involving drug metabolism, such as affecting drug absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Whether a drug is an inhibitor, inducer or substrate of a P450 enzyme can be easily determined by procedures known to the skilled person. Such procedures may involve the exposure of a radiolabelled drug to hepatocytes or hepatocyte microsomes or isolated P450 enzyme and the use of analytic techniques, such as HPLC, in determining metabolite formation. A specific procedure is described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">By the term &#x201c;combination&#x201d; we mean either that the Agent and the drug of the combination are administered together in the same pharmaceutical formulation or that the Agent and the drug are administered separately. When administered separately components of the combination may be administered to the patient simultaneously or sequentially.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">We have found that the Agent is not metabolised significantly by the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. This is a further feature of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferred non-interacting combinations of the invention include those in which the Agent is combined with a drug which is also involved in lowering cholesterol and is also an inducer, inhibitor or substrate of P450 3A4. Examples include fibrates, such as bezafibrate, clofibrate, ciprofibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrizol (preferably fenofibrate), and niacin. Specific embodiments of this preferred feature are described in Section B below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferred non-interacting combinations of the invention include those in which the Agent is combined with a drug which is involved in treating cardiovascular conditions and which is also an inhibitor, inducer or substrate of P450 3A4. Examples include digitoxin, diltiazem, losartan, nifedipine, quinidine, verapamil and warfarin.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferred non-interacting combinations of the invention include those in which the Agent is combined with cyclosporin and/or tacrolimus (FK506) and therefore has utility in treating elevated cholesterol levels in patients who are about to, or have recently undergone, a transplantation operation. Specific embodiments of this preferred feature are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferred patients in which the combination of the invention is to be administered are those who suffer from myopathy or rhabdomylosis or who have already been found to suffer from myopathy or rhabdomylosis when treated with HMG Co A reductase inhibitor which is metabolised by P450 3A4, for example atorvastatin, simvastatin and lovastatin.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Other features of the invention include those described above wherein the Agent is used at doses of 5 to 80 mg per day. When a dose range of 5 to 80 mg per day is referred to herein for the Agent other particular dosage ranges, which are further independent aspects of the invention, include (as appropriate) 10 to 80 mg per day, 10 to 60 mg per day, 10 to 40 mg per day, 5 to 40 mg per day, 5 to 20 mg per day, 10 to 20 mg per day, 20 to 60 mg per day, 20 to 40 mg per day and 40 to 60 mg per day. Particular dosages are 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg per day. A particularly suitable starting dose of the Agent in the methods referred herein is 5 to 10 mg per day, especially 10 mg per day.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">P450 3A4 substrates include; acetominophen, aldrin, aflentanil, amiodorane, astemizole, benzphetamine, budenoside, carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin, dapsone, digitoxin, ditiazem, diazepam, erthromycin, etoposide, flutamide, hydroxyarginine, ifosphamide, imipramine, lansoprazole, lidocaine, lovatidine, losartan, lovastatin, midrazolam, nifedipine, omeprazole, quinidine, rapamycin, retenoic acid, steroids, tacrolimus, teniposide, theophyline, toremifene, triazolam, troleandomycin, verapamil, warfarin, zatosetron and zonisamide.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Examples of other P450 inducers, inhibitors or substrates include those mentioned in Drug Metabolism Reviews (1997) Vol 29, Issue 1+2, pages 413&#x2013;580, Rendic, S. and Di Carlo, F. J. &#x201c;Human cytochrome P450 enzymes,: A status report summarising their reactions, substrates, inducers and inhibitors&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Dosages of the Agent may be administered according to the cholesterol lowering effect desired from a range of 5 to 80 mg per day in any number of unit dosages. Dosages of the drug which is an inducer, inhibitor or substrate of P450 3A4 are those which are advised for each drug, or which are commercially available. Advantageously, due to the lack of interaction at the level of P450 3A4, the skilled person may dose the Agent with a drug which is an inducer, inhibitor or substrate of P450 3A4 with out needing to make any adjustments.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The dose ranges and dosages described above are further independent features of the invention.</p>

Assessment of Data
</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0051">Data generated during this study was assessed with regard to the following:&#x2014;
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0052">(a) The rate and extent of metabolism of [<sup>14</sup>C]-labelled Agent.</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0053">(b) The ability of the selective P450 inhibitors to decrease the metabolism of [<sup>14</sup>C]-labelled Agent was compared in order to determine the isozyme(s) involved in the metabolism of [<sup>14</sup>C]-labelled Agent.</li>

    <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0055">c) These in vitro data can be used to predict the variability of the pharmacokinetics of the Agent in the population and the likely effects on the pharmacokinetics of the Agent during co-administration with known P450 enzyme inhibitors/inducers.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0056">It was found that the Agent was not significantly metabolised by whole hepatocytes and that his was inhibited by sulphaphenazole and omeprazole.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">For Treating Hyperlipidaemia and Associated Conditions in Post Transplant Patients Receiving Immunosuppressive Therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0057">Two common drugs used in suppressing the human immune system, cyclosporin and tacrolimus (formerly called FK506), are known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4. In particular cyclosporin is also a known inhibitor of P450 3A4 and is therefore likely to reduce the metabolism of any other drug which is metabolised by P450 3A4.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0058">Therefore where immunosuppressive therapy is prescribed, such as with the drugs cyclosporin and tacrolimus (especially cyclosporin), the attendant physician must be cautious as to any other therapy which may be jointly presented to the patient in combination. Immunosuppressive therapy is most commonly used before, during and after human transplant operations. In particular with cardiac transplants the attendant physician may wish to also, place the patient on statin drug therapy to reduce future incidents of coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral arterial occlusive disease or peripheral vascular disease, particularly in patients with elevated cholesterol or in normolipidaemic patients with other risk factors associated with heart disease. In particular within this special patient group (human transplant patients), the patients are at high risk of developing accelerated atherosclerosis in the transplant organ in an aggressive fashion and within a short period of time due, in part, to the surgical damage to the blood vessels during transplantation, any previously underlying untreated conditions and the immunosupressive therapy. Hyperlipidaemia is common after transplantation even in patients who did not suffer hyperlipidaemia prior to transplantation, incidence 60&#x2013;80% of recipients.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0059">It is known that certain immunosuppresive drugs, such as steroids, cyclosporin and tacrolimus, raise cholesterol levels in patients (Wierzbicki A S (1999) IJCP 53 (1) 54&#x2013;59). In addition cyclosporin and tacrolimus may raise the levels of fibrinogen and lipoprotein (a) in the patient, further accelerating the progression of atherosclerosis in the transplant patient (Hohaye H, Clin. Transplant (1997) 11, 225&#x2013;230 and Hilbrands L B, J. Am. Soc. Nephrol (1995) 5, 2073&#x2013;2081). This unusually accelerated atherosclerosis is present in about 20% of heart transplant patients at 1 year and 40&#x2013;65% at 5 years (Chang G. Et al. American Heart Journal (1998), 136(2), 329&#x2013;334). The incidence of accelerated atherosclerosis has been reported as causing a 1&#x2013;18% incidence of CHD at one year and 20&#x2013;50% incidence of CHD at 3 years in cardiac transplant patients (Erdoes L S, J. Vasc. Surg. (1995) 22, 434&#x2013;440). Lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin have all shown to lower cholesterol levels in heart transplant patients. In a placebo controlled study pravastatin increased survival of transplant patients by 1 year and significantly reduced the incidence of haemodynamic organ rejection. Because of the lower incidence of serious drug interaction with the immunosuppresive therapy pravastatin is currently the statin drug of choice in post transplant treatment regimes. However, as discussed above, pravastatin does not lower lipid/cholesterol levels to such a great extent as, for example, atorvastatin.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0060">We have discovered that the Agent is extremely effective at treating hypercholesterolaemia in patients following transplantation and that the Agent is not metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4. Therefore we have found through the use of the Agent in a clinical study that the Agent may be conveniently dosed to patients who are undertaking immunosuppressive therapy without any clinically significant side effects associated with the concomitant dosing of the Agent and the immunosuppressive drug(s) and, in addition, also achieve much higher levels of cholesterol lowering than has previously been achieved, such as by the use of pravastatin.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0061">We present as the first feature of the invention a method of providing safe non-interacting cholesterol lowering therapy to a human patient undertaking immunosuppressive chemotherapy which method comprises administering to the patient the Agent.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0062">Particular patients undertaking immunosuppressive chemotherapy who may benefit from the method of the invention are those who:
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0063">1) suffer primary (type IIa) hypercholesterolaemia (LDL-L&#x2267;135 and TG&#x3c;200);</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0064">2) suffer combined (type IIb) hypercholesterolaemia (LDL-C&#x2267;135 and TG&#x2267;200);</li>

    <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0066">4) patients who are at high risk of developing CHD or other atherosclerotic disease, such as described above, because of a combination of risk factors. The term &#x201c;high risk&#x201d; is defined in the &#x201c;Recommendations of Second Joint Task Force of European and other Societies on Coronary Prevention&#x201d;, (Wood, D. et. al. European Heart Journal, Atherosclerosis and Journal of Hypertension 1998) as absolute CHD risk of &#x2267;20% over 10 years or will exceed 20% if projected to age 60 years. Whether a patient is at high risk or not may be determined by the charts which accompany the above recommendations and which charts are incorporated herein by reference. For example a male patient in his 40s who smokes and has a systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or higher and a total plasma cholesterol concentration of 7 mmol/L or higher will be classified as high risk. Similarly other guidelines for reducing risk factors may be applied such as those described in;

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0078">As a further feature of the invention, and due also to the fact that the Agent is not metabolised to any significant extent by P450 isoenzymes, it is possible to administer, more safely than before, to a patient receiving immunosuppresive therapy a fibrate and the Agent. As discussed earlier the administration of a fibrate and a statin has previously been associated with a higher incidence of rhabdomyolysis and myopathy. In addition fibrate drugs do interact with cyclosporin due to both being metabolised by the same P450 isoenzyme. Therefore, the use of a statin and a fibrate drug in combination with immunosuppresive therapy was previously contraindicated due to the likelihood of possible serious interactions (Hunninghake 1992, Wanner C. Kidney Int. (1995) 52(suppl.), S60&#x2013;S62; and Katznelson S. Contributions Nephrol. (1997) 120, 97&#x2013;104). However, if possible, it would be advantageous to also administer a fibrate alongside a statin since fibrates are known to lower different lipoproteins than statins and therefore their combined pharmacology would be complementary in reducing even further the likelihood of CHD and other diseases mentioned above associated with the formation of atherosclerosis. Therefore the possibility of combining the Agent, which is not metabolised by P450 3A4, with a fibrate and an immunosuppresive therapy offers the additional possibility of lowering cholesterol to a greater extent in such patients than previously achieved and more safely than could previously be achieved by the administration of a statin, a fibrate and an immunosuppresive drug.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0079">Fibrate drugs are thought to act through peroxisomal proliferating activator receptor-&#x3b1; (PPAR-&#x3b1;) and affect gene activation at a number of genes involved in atheroma. Patients on fibrate drugs show improved LDL subfraction distribution (reduced VLDL and raised HDL), reduced LDL and reduced triglyceride levels, and possible advantages through improving insulin sensitivity. Examples of fibrate drugs include, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrozol.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0080">By use of the term &#x201c;safe non-interacting statin therapy&#x201d; we mean that the Agent is not metabolised by P450 3A4 and therefore does not affect the metabolism of the immunosuppresive therapy or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0081">Diseases and conditions in which immunosuppressive therapy may be prescribed include, in addition to organ transplantation mentioned above, autoimmune diseases, including rheumatic disorders, such as, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, lupus erthematosus; and other autoimmune disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and acute glomerulonephritis.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0082">The agent may be administered at the same time as the immunosuppressive chemotherapy, or if not at the same time within a short time period of administration of the immunosuppressive therapy, such as in the same day, within 6, 3, 2 or 1 hour.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0083">The Agent may be administered according to the cholesterol lowering effect desired from a range of 5&#x2013;80 mg per day in any number of unit dosages, preferable once a day dosing. Ideal doses are 10, 20 and 40 mg once per day. Preferred doses are 20 and 40 mg once per day.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0084">Particular immunosuppressive drugs which may be combined with the Agents are those which are metabolised by liver enzymes, such as by P450 3A4, and therefore are not likely to have a drug interaction with the Agent. Examples include those described above, cyclosporin and tacrolimus, as well as corticosteroids, which are also metabolised in the liver. Examples of corticosteroids include prednisone (especially used for organ transplantation). Preferably at least one of the immunosuppressive agents, if more than one agent is used, is either cyclosporin or tacrolimus, preferably cyclosporin.</p>

For Treating Hyperlipidaemia, and Associated Conditions, Using a Combination of the Agent and a Fibrate Drug or Niacin
</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0128">Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been associated with taking a statin in combination with gemfibrozil, niacin, cyclosporin or erythromycin, (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, Hunninghake, Current Opinion in Lipidology (1992) 3, 22&#x2013;28) which are all substrates for P450 3A4. Additionally, adverse events associated with taking a fibrate drug have also been reported to increase with concomitant statin therapy, such as a myosistis-flu like syndrome, which occasionally occurs in patients receiving gemfibrozil, increases to 5% of patients when a statin is also administered.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0129">Combination of a statin with a fibrate drug is contraindicated on the labels, both in the USA and Europe, of all commercially available statins. Despite the possibility of the occurrence of serious drug interactions doctors do prescribe combination therapy of a statin and a fibrate drug to patients with more severe levels of hypercholesterolaemia, such as in patients with familial combined hyperlipidaemia, where the risk of a serious drug interaction is outweighed by the benefits of the combination therapy. It is recommended that where combination therapy of a fibrate drug and a statin is prescribed that patients should have their CK value determined on a regular-basis, typically every 6-weeks, until a stable pattern is established. Therapy is stopped if muscle symptoms occur in association with elevated CK activity. However, as quoted from the US label of Lipitor&#x2122; &#x201c;there is no assurance that such monitoring [of CK levels] will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0130">We have discovered that the Agent is extremely effective at treating mixed hyperlipidaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia in patients when combined with a fibrate drug and that the Agent is not metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4. Therefore we have found through the use of the Agent in a clinical study that the Agent may be conveniently dosed to patients who are also taking a fibrate drug without any clinically significant side effects associated with the concomitant dosing of the Agent and the fibrate drug. In addition much higher levels of lipid lowering than has previously been achieved can be achieved by the use of the Agent and a fibrate drug. The combination is of most use in mixed hyperlipidemia where the LDL and VLDL and TGs are all elevated.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0131">We present as the first feature of the invention a method of providing safe non-interacting lipid lowering combination therapy to a mammal, including a human patient, preferably a patient suffering mixed hyperlipidaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia, which method comprises administering to the patient the Agent and a fibrate drug or niacin.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0132">By the term &#x201c;combination&#x201d; as used herein we mean either (1) that the Agent and the fibrate drug of the combination are administered together in the same pharmaceutical formulation or (2) that the Agent and the drug are administered separately. When administered separately components of the combination may be administered to the patient simultaneously or sequentially.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0133">By the term &#x201c;fibrate drug&#x201d; we mean the class of drugs which are based around the structure/activity of fibric acid and such drugs include the following commercially available versions; bezafibrate, clofibrate, ciprofibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrizol, preferably fenofibrate.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0134">Preferred patients in which the combination of the invention is to be administered are those who have already been found to suffer from myopathy or rhabdomylosis when treated with a statin and/or with a fibrate drug which is metabolised by P450 3A4.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0135">Particular patients who may benefit from the method of the invention are those who:
<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0136">1) suffer combined (type IIb) hypercholesterolaemia (typically LDL-C&#x2267;135 mg/dL and TG&#x2267;200 mg/dL);</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0137">2) suffer familial (type IV and V) hypercholesterolaemia;</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0003" num="0138">3) patients suffering secondary hypercholesterolaemia from such conditions as:
    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0139">a) diabetes (type I or II),</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="ul0011-0004" num="0144">4) patients with established CHD or other atherosclerotic disease, such a PVD, stroke or peripheral arterial occlusive disease;</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0005" num="0145">5) patients who are at high risk of developing CHD or other atherosclerotic disease, such as described above, because of a combination of risk factors. The term &#x201c;high risk&#x201d; is defined in the &#x201c;Recommendations of Second Joint Task Force of European and other Societies on Coronary Prevention&#x201d;, (Wood, D. et. al. European Heart Journal, Atherosclerosis and Journal of Hypertension 1998) as absolute CHD risk of &#x2267;20% over 10 years or will exceed 20% if projected to age 60 years. Whether a patient is at high risk or not may be determined by the charts which accompany the above recommendations and which charts are incorporated herein by reference. For example a male patient in his 40s who smokes and has a systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or higher and a total plasma cholesterol concentration of 7 mmol/L or higher will be classified as high risk. Similarly other guidelines for reducing risk factors may be applied such as those described in;

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to the inhibition of thrombin-induced cell activation, and to the identification of compounds that inhibit thrombin-induced cell activation.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Bradykinin is a vasoactive peptide released from the precursor plasma kininogens by kallikrein and other enzymes (Silva et al., <i>Amer. J. Physiol. </i>156: 261-274 (1949)). Bradykinin has been described to have multiple physiologic functions, including the stimulation of prostacyclin production (Hong, S. L., <i>Thromb. Res. </i>18, 787 (1980); Crutchley et al., <i>Biochim Biophy Acta </i>751, 99 (1983)) and the stimulation of the release of plasminogen activators (Smith et al., <i>Blood </i>66, 835 (1983)). Bradykinin induces superoxide formation and endothelium-dependent smooth muscle hyperpolarization (Holland, J. A. et al., <i>J. Cell Physiol. </i>143, 21 (1990); Nakashima, M. et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>92, 2867 (1993)). Along with acetylcholine, bradykinin is the major inducer of nitric oxide formation (Palmer, R. M. J. et al., <i>Nature </i>327, 524 (1987)). Bradykinin has been characterized to produce vasodilation in most vascular beds which in the coronary artery circulation results in increased blood flow (Line et al., <i>J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. </i>24, 909 (1992)). These latter features have led some to characterize bradykinin as a cardioprotective agent (Line et al., supra; Gohlke et al., <i>Hypertension </i>23, 411 (1994); Parratt et al., <i>Cardiovascular Research </i>28, 183 (1994); Zanzinger et al., <i>Cardiovascular Research </i>28, 209 (1994)). Bradykinin's elevation by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is believed to be the mechanism by which these drugs promote their beneficial effects on heart failure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to the delivery of bradykinin, its parent proteins, high (HK) and low (LK) molecular weight kininogens, also have the ability to be selective inhibitors of &#x3b1;-thrombin, inhibiting &#x3b1;-thrombin's ability to activate cells without interfering with its enzymatic ability (Meloni et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>266, 6786 (1991); Puri et al., <i>Blood </i>77, 500 (1991)). This activity was believed to be a unique function for the kininogens; one which had not been ascribed to other proteins. Most naturally occurring human protein inhibitors of &#x3b1;-thrombin are directed towards its protease activity. HK and LK are selective inhibitors of thrombin's ability to activate platelets by blocking &#x3b1;-thrombin from binding to the platelet membrane (Meloni et al., supra; Puri et al., supra). This activity of the kininogens appeared to be localized to domain 3 on their heavy chain since isolated domain 3 retains that activity (Jiang et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>267, 3712 (1992)).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Inhibition of platelet activation by domain 3 is observed by a marked decrease in the platelet's ability to aggregate and secrete their granule contents. The granule contents comprise proteins which participate in hemostasis, thrombosis, and the inflammatory response. Inhibition of endothelial cell activation may similarly be observed by a decrease in secretion of endothelial cell contents such as tissue plasminogen activator and von Willebrand factor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The isolated domain 3 from a tryptic digest of LK, like its parent proteins HK and LK, functions to inhibit cell activation by blocking thrombin binding to its target cells. This polypeptide is a selective inhibitor of thrombin-induced platelet activation. Administration of domain 3 in vitro therefore does not impact on induction of platelet activation by physiological substances other than thrombin, such as, for example collagen, adenosine diphosphate, epinephrine and platelet activating factor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Interventional procedures for coronary artery disease such as coronary thrombolysis or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty have reduced mortality from acute coronary thrombosis. However, after intracoronary thrombolysis with lytic agents, the reocclusion rate is high. The major cause for reocclusion is platelet thrombus. When artificial dacron grafts are anastomosed to human arteries, up to 30% of all patients will develop a platelet thrombosis within hours of surgery. This expected high complication rate frequently requires an additional operation with attendant complications. Thus, additional therapies are needed to prevent these reocclusion events due to platelet thrombi.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Two competing classes of antiplatelet agents for the prevention of coronary thrombosis are being considered. One class of agents, including monoclonal antibody 7E3, aims to block the final common pathway of platelet activation by inhibiting glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa), integrin &#x3b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x3b2;<sub>3</sub>. 7E3 is an effective agent, but it is a murine antibody and is antigenic in humans. A second class of antiplatelet agents inhibit a presumed, primary initiating agent of platelet activation, &#x3b1;-thrombin. Infusions of Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone (PPACK), a potent inhibitor of &#x3b1;-thrombin's proteolytic activity, prolongs the bleeding time, a crude measure of platelet function (Hanson, S. R. et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </i>85, 3184-3188 (1988)). The first generation of potent &#x3b1;-thrombin proteolytic inhibitors to enter into clinical trials is a recombinant product derived from medicinal leeches, hirudin. This compound, which is a small molecular mass and is not considered to be antigenic, is a potent anti-thrombin. A synthetic analog of hirudin, hirulog, combines the anion exosite I binding properties of hirudin with the proteolytic inhibitory activity of PPACK. In Phase III clinical trials, both drugs were effective inhibitors of platelet activation. The tradeoff for effective anticoagulation, however, was increased hemorrhage into brain leading to the termination of three clinical trials. These non-selective inhibitors of &#x3b1;-thrombin have an antithrombotic efficiency dose close to their toxicity dose and are not clinically tolerated and, thus, may never have commercial significance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An ideal anti-thrombotic to prevent arterial thrombosis would be one which prevents platelet and endothelial cell activation without preventing the proteolytic activity of &#x3b1;-thrombin to clot fibrinogen and activate protein C, factor XIII, and factors V and VIII. Only two known proteins, high molecular weight (HK) and low molecular weight (LK) kininogens, are naturally occurring selective anti-thrombins (Meloni, F. J. et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>266; 6786-6794 (1991); Puri, R. N. et al., <i>Blood </i>77:500-507 (1991)). Both low and high molecular weight kininogens have identical amino acid sequences from their amino-terminus through 12 amino acids beyond the carboxy-terminus of bradykinin. LK and HK share a common heavy chain (62 kDa), the bradykinin (BK) moiety (0.9 kDa), and the first 12 amino acids of the amino terminal portion of each of their &#x201c;light chains&#x201d; (Takagaki, Y. et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>260:8601-8609 (1985); Kitamura, N. et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>260:8610-8617 (1985)). This identity corresponds to residues 1 through about residue 383. See Salveson et al., <i>Biochem J. </i>234, 429 (1986); Kellerman et al., <i>Eur. J. Biochem. </i>154, 471 (1986). They diverge in the size of their light chains; the light chain of LK is 4 kDa; that of HK is 56 kDa. Takagaki et al., supra; Kitamura et al., supra.</p>

Most known thrombin inhibitors, hirudin, hirulog and PPACK, interfere with &#x3b1;-thrombin's action by blocking all of its proteolytic activity. Use of these proteolytic inhibitors to inhibit &#x3b1;-thrombin activation of platelets may result in excessive anticoagulation and hemorrhage. The BK analogs utilized in the present method allow for inhibition of thrombin-induced cell activation (e.g. platelet activation, mitogenesis) without interfering with &#x3b1;-thrombin's enzymatic activity on other substrates, such as proteolysis of fibrinogen and activation of factor XIII. BK analogs may be used to prevent arterial occlusions which occur in coronary thrombosis and stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0067">The BK analogs of the present invention block 1 nM &#x3b3;-thrombin from activating platelets in the presence of 100 mg/dl fibrinogen and in platelet-rich plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0068">The BK analogs of the present invention do not appear to inhibit platelet activation by the same mechanism as intact kininogen and its isolated domain 3, because the BK analogs do not inhibit <sup>125</sup>-&#x3b1;-thrombin binding to platelets, as does a molar excess of purified HK, LK, or isolated domain 3.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0069">Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the BK analogs of the present invention are believed to inhibit platelet and other cell activation by inhibiting &#x3b1;-thrombin from cleaving its receptor, which is expressed on platelets and other cells. The BK analogs thus have the ability to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet activation by blocking cleavage of the thrombin receptor and subsequent activation of platelets by exposure of the new amino terminus of the cleaved receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0070">Administration of a BK analog as described herein comprises a therapeutic method for inhibiting thrombin-induced activation of platelets, endothelial cells, brain cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, or other cells that express the thrombin receptor. This function inhibits platelet thrombus formation and other activities mediated by the thrombin receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0071">The thrombin receptor peptide NAT12 and monoclonal antibodies SPAN12 and ATAP138 are useful for characterizing the compounds, compositions, and methods of the present invention, as illustrated in Example 1. NAT12 has a sequence, Asn-Ala-Thr-Leu-Asp-Pro-Arg-Ser-Phe-Leu-Leu-Arg (SEQ ID NO:2), which spans the &#x3b1;-thrombin cleavage site on the thrombin receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0072">Monoclonal antibodies to the thrombin receptor, SPAN12 and ATAP138, were obtained from Dr. Lawrence F. Brass of the University of Pennsylvania, and were prepared according to the method of Brass et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>267, 13795 (1992). Monoclonal antibody SPAN12 was reared to the 12 amino acids. Asn-Ala-Thr-Leu-Asp-Pro-Arg-Ser-Phe-Leu-Leu-Arg (SEQ ID NO:2), that bridge the &#x3b1;-thrombin cleavage site on the thrombin receptor. Monoclonal antibody ATAP138 recognizes an epitope, Asn-Pro-Asn-Asp-Lys-Tyr-Glu-Pro-Phe (SEQ ID NO:3), on the thrombin receptor which is preserved after cleavage by &#x3b1;-thrombin. When &#x3b1;-thrombin cleaves the thrombin receptor, it eliminates the epitope which is recognized by the SPAN12 antibody but not the epitope which is recognized by the ATAP138 antibody.</p>

where R is a hydrogen atom or an organic side chain, are added to either the carboxyl or amino terminus of a peptide comprising the core sequence Arg-Pro-Pro, in order to form chain expansion analogs. Up to thirty amino acids may be added to either the carboxyl or amino terminus of the core sequence. Preferably, from zero to seven amino acids are added to the amino terminus, and zero to nine amino acids are added to the carboxyl terminus of the core sequence. An example of the BK analogs included in this invention is the BK analog SEQ ID NO:6, which has the sequence Arg-Pro-Pro Ala-Phe. Another example is the tripeptide Arg-Pro-Pro.

<p id="p-0069" num="0075">According to one embodiment of the invention, the BK analog has the sequence X<sub>1</sub>-Arg-Pro-Pro-X<sub>2</sub>, wherein X<sub>1 </sub>is from zero to thirty amino acids from the amino terminal portion of the kininogen heavy chain parent segment (amino acids 1-30 of SEQ ID NO: 1) and X<sub>2 </sub>is from zero to thirty natural or synthetic amino acids, provided that the N-terminal amino acid of X<sub>2 </sub>is not glycine.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0076">In another embodiment of the invention, the BK analog has the sequence X<sub>1</sub>-Arg-Pro-Pro-X<sub>2</sub>, wherein X<sub>1 </sub>is from zero to seven amino acids from the amino terminal portion of the kininogen heavy chain parent segment (amino acids 24-30 of SEQ ID NO:1) and X<sub>2 </sub>is from zero to nine natural or synthetic amino acids, provided that the N-terminal amino acid of X<sub>2 </sub>is not glycine.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0077">According to another embodiment of the invention, two or more single-chain BK analogs are joined by one or more linkers, L, to form homodimers, heterodimers, trimers, or other multimers. The linker can be either a covalent bond or a chemical group. The number of single-chain BK analogs that can be joined is from two to thirty-two. Preferably, the number of BK analogs joined is from two to twenty, more preferably from two to eight, and most preferably, from two to four. The BK analogs to be joined can be identical or they can be different. A heterodimer is comprised of two different single-chain BK analogs; a homodimer is comprised of two identical single-chain BK analogs. The multimers can be symmetric or asymmetric. A &#x201c;symmetric homodimer&#x201d; means a homodimer in which the linker joins amino acids which occupy the same position in the single chain BK analogs. An &#x201c;asymmetric homodimer&#x201d; means a homodimer in which the linker joins amino acids which occupy different positions in the single chain BK analogs.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0078">An example of a covalent bond linking two single-chain BK analogs is the disulfide bond formed by the oxidation of two single chain BK analogs containing cysteine amino acids. This may require initially modifying the parent peptide so that the peptide includes a Cys residue in the appropriate position. Cysteine residues on single-chain BK analogs can be oxidized to form BK analog dimers by dissolving 1 mg of the single-chain peptide in 1.5 ml of 0.1% (v/v) 17.5 mM acetic acid, pH 8.4, followed by flushing with nitrogen and then 0.01 M K<sub>2</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>. After incubation for one hour at room temperature, the dimer peptide is purified by HPLC.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0079">Another example of a suitable covalent bond for linking two single-chain BK analogs is the amide bond formed by reacting the amino group of a lysine amino acid residue on one chain with the carboxylic acid group of a glutamic or aspartic amino acid residue of another chain.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0080">Alternatively, the linking group can be formed by the covalent bond between two single-chain BK analogs using a cross-linking reagent. For example, homodimers and heterodimers can be prepared by first preparing S-(-N-hexylsuccinimido)-modified peptide monomers according to the method of Cheronis et al., <i>J Med. Chem. </i>37: 348 (1994). N-hexylmaleimide, a precursor for the modified peptide monomers, is prepared from N-(methoxycarbonyl)maleimide and N-hexylamine by mixing the two compounds in saturated NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>at 0&#xb0; C. according to the procedure of Bodanszky and Bodanszky, <i>The Practice of Peptide Synthesis; </i>Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 29-31 (1984). The product of the resulting reaction mixture is isolated by extraction into ethyl acetate, followed by washing with water, dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and is then concentrated in vacuo to produce N-hexylmaleimide as a light yellow oil. S-(N-Hexylsuccinimido)-modified peptide monomers are then prepared from a cysteine-containing peptide (monomer) and N-hexylmaleimide by mixing one part peptide with 1.5 parts N-hexylmaleimide in dimethylfonmamide (3.3 ml/mM peptide) followed by addition to 30 volumes of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. The S-alkylation reaction carried out in this manner is complete in 30 min. The resulting S-(N-hexylsuccinimido)-modified peptide monomer is purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC, followed by lyophilization as a fluffy, white powder.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">Bissuccinimidohexane peptide dimers, either as homodimers or heterodimers, may be prepared according to the method of Cheronis et al., supra from cysteine-substituted peptides in the same or different positions, respectively. A mixture of one part bismaleimidohexane is made with two parts peptide monomer in dimethylformamide (3.3 ml/mM peptide) followed by addition to 0.1 ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature and is usually completed within 30 min. The resulting bissuccinimidohexane peptide dimer is purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC. After lyophilization the material is a fluffy, white powder.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0082">Covalently cross-linked BK analog dimers of the present invention may be prepared by utilizing homobifunctional cross-linking reagents, e.g., disuccinimidyl tartrate, disuccinimidyl suberate, ethylene glycolbis(succinimidyl succinate), 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (&#x201c;DFNB&#x201d;), 4,4&#x2032;-diisothiocyano-2,2&#x2032;-disulfonic acid stilbene (&#x201c;DIDS&#x201d;), and bismaleimidohexane (&#x201c;BMH&#x201d;). The cross-linking reaction occurs randomly between the single-chain BK analogs.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0083">Alternatively, heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents may be employed. Such agents include, for example, N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (&#x201c;SPDP&#x201d;), sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(p-azidosalicylamido)ethyl-1-3&#x2032;-dithiopropionate (&#x201c;SASD&#x201d;, Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Ill.), N-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester (&#x201c;MBS&#x201d;), m-maleimidobenzoylsulfosuccinimide ester (&#x201c;sulfo-MBS&#x201d;), N-succinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl)aminobenzoate (&#x201c;SIAB&#x201d;), succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (&#x201c;SMCC&#x201d;), succinimidyl-4-(p-maleimidophenyl)butyrate (&#x201c;SMPB&#x201d;), sulfosuccinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl)aminobenzoate (&#x201c;sulfo-SIAB&#x201d;), sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (&#x201c;sulfo-SMCC&#x201d;), sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(p-maleimidophenyl)-butyrate(&#x201c;sulfo-SMPB&#x201d;), bromoacetyl-p-arninobenzoyl-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl ester, iodoacetyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0084">For heterobifunctional cross-linking, a first single-chain BK analog is derivatized with, e.g., the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl portion of the bifunctional reagent, and the derivatized BK analog is purified by gel filtration. Next, a second single-chain BK analog (which may or may not be the same or different from the first BK analog) is reacted with the second functional group of the bifunctional reagent, assuring a directed sequence of binding between components of the BK dimer.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0085">Typical heterobifunctional cross-linking agents for forming protein-protein conjugates have an amino-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS-ester) as one functional group and a sulfhydryl reactive group as the other functional group. First, epsilon-amino groups of surface lysine residues of the first single chain BK analog are acylated with the NHS-ester group of the cross-linking agent. The second single chain BK analog, possessing free sulfhydryl groups, is reacted with the sulfhydryl reactive group of the cross-linking agent to form a covalently cross-linked dimer. Common thiol reactive groups include maleimides, pyridyl disulfides, and active halogens. For example, MBS contains a NHS-ester as the amino reactive group, and a maleimide moiety as the sulfhydryl reactive group.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0086">Photoactive heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents, e.g., photoreactive phenyl azides, may also be employed. One such reagent, SASD, may be linked to a single-chain BK analog via its NHS-ester group. The conjugation reaction is carried out at pH 7 at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Molar ratios between about 1 and about 20 of the cross-linking agent to the BK analog may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0087">The purified, derivatized BK analog is collected by affinity chromatography using a matrix having affinity for BK analogs, e.g., a polyclonal antibody reared to the BK analog. Antibody for this purpose may be prepared by coupling the BK analog to key hole limpet hemocyanin using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide-HCL (Goodfriend et al., <i>Science </i>144, 1344 (1964)). The resulting conjugate is used to immunize rabbits by the procedure of M&#xfc;ller-Esterl et al., <i>Methods Enzymol </i>163, 240 (1988) to produce anti-BK analog antibodies. The purified antibody is coupled to AFFIGEL 10 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif.) to form an affinity column. Immobilized anti-BK analog antibody, with the derivatized BK analog bound thereto, is then removed from the column by 0.2 M glycine elution and suspended in a solution of a second single chain BK analog. An ultraviolet light source (e.g., Mineralight UVSL-25, Ultra Violet Products, Inc., San Gabriel, Calif.) is positioned 1 cm from the gently stirred suspension and irradiated in a long-wavelength range for about 10 minutes. The suspension is put back on the anti-BK analog antibody affinity column and washed with a buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% polysorbate 80 and 25 KIU/ml of aprotinin to remove reaction byproducts. The covalently cross-linked dimer is eluted with the same buffer system containing 0.2 M glycine or 5 M guanidine. The eluted dimer is dialyzed against buffer to remove the chaotropic agent.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0088">Following reaction with the BK analog under ultraviolet irradiation, and chromatography of the reaction mixture as above, the covalently cross-linked dimer is eluted with either 0.2 M glycine or 5 M guanidine.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0089">While the above-described procedure utilizes SASD, a cleavable cross-linker, non-cleavable cross-linking reagents may be utilized which contain, e.g., alpha-hexanoate, rather than beta-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropopionate moieties. MSB is one example of a non-cleavable cross-linking reagent.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0090">The single-chain BK analogs may be prepared by conventional solid phase peptide synthesis techniques using automated synthesis. Alternatively, BK analogs may be prepared by recombinant DNA techniques. A gene which encodes a BK analog may be constructed and introduced into an appropriate host by use of an appropriate cloning vector. Thus, it should be understood that the present invention is not merely limited to the use of BK analogs as prepared by peptide synthetic methods, but also includes polypeptides prepared by recombinant techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0091">Moreover, by utilization of such recombinant techniques, one skilled in the art may prepare additional BK analogs using methods such as site-directed mutagenesis of the relevant DNA, wherein an amino acid sequence may be modified to contain single or multiple amino acid changes, additions, or deletions.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0092">Such sequence modifications are included within the scope of the invention, provided that the resulting molecule substantially retains the ability to inhibit thrombin-induced cell activation.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0093">Additional BK analogs may be identified by screening a combinatorial library which displays a plurality of peptide analogs. As an example, degenerate oligonucleotides may be used to direct the display of heterologous peptides on the surface of microorganisms (for example, bacteriophage, bacteria, yeast). One such method uses a display library expressing the DNA sequence (NNK)<sub>n</sub>. This DNA encodes the amino acid sequence (Xaa)<sub>n</sub>, which includes all peptides having n amino acids. The number of possible peptides (using the 20 natural amino acids) is 20&#xb0;. Libraries of such microorganisms are initially screened for the ability to bind the cloned thrombin receptor or the NAT12 peptide, as described in Example 2. Peptides having activity in a binding assay are screened using one of the in vitro functional assays described in Example 1. Activity in the in vitro functional assays is predictive of activity in vivo, as shown in Example 3. New BK analogs which show activity in the in vitro functional assays are tested for safety and efficacy in animals and in human clinical trials.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0094">Combinatorial libraries can also be prepared on a solid phase matrix support, and screened for the ability to bind to the thrombin cleavage site on the thrombin receptor. It is particularly advantageous to screen combinatorial libraries for compounds which (1) inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, (2) bind to the thrombin cleavage site on the thrombin receptor, and (3) inhibit thrombin-induced calcium mobilization in fibroblasts. This combination screening method identifies compounds which are selective inhibitors of thrombin-induced platelet and other cell activation. Additional methods of preparing and screening combinatorial libraries are known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0095">Purified BK analogs may be administered in any circumstance where inhibition of thrombin-induced or ADP-induced platelet activation or platelet aggregation is sought. BK analogs are administered to subjects experiencing platelet thrombosis from any cause, and may also be used prophylactically in subjects undergoing surgery or catherization for insertion of artificial dacron grafts and stents to prevent reocclusion events due to platelet thrombi. BK analogs may be infused into individuals to prevent strokes and cerebral edema.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0096">The BK analogs may be administered by any convenient means which will result in substantial delivery into the bloodstream, including intravenous, intranasal, and oral administration, as well as administration via a dermal patch or rectal suppositories. Intravenous administration is presently contemplated as the preferred administration route, although intranasal administration may also be utilized. Since BK analogs are soluble in water, they may be effectively administered in solution. The actual dosage administered may take into account the size and weight of the patient, whether the nature of the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic in nature, the age, health and sex of the patient, the route of administration, and other factors. Those skilled in the art can derive appropriate dosages and schedules of administration to suit the specific circumstances and needs of the patient. An effective daily dosage of active ingredients, based upon in vivo clearance studies using BK analogs related to those of the present invention, is from about 0.1 to about 10 grams per day per 70 Kg of body weight. The effective daily dosage is preferably from about 1 to about 5 grams per day per 70 Kg of body weight. In a preferred embodiment, a dosage of about 3 grams per day per 70 kg of body weight is given in a single bolus infusion of 2.4 grams followed by a continuous infusion of 0.025 g/hour.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0097">The amount of BK analog administered will also depend upon the degree of platelet activation or aggregation inhibition that is desired. While infusion of a BK analog to achieve 3 grams per day dosage may be advantageously utilized, more or less of the peptide may be administered as needed. The therapeutic end point may be determined by monitoring platelet finction by aggregation and secretion, vessel patency, and bleeding. The actual amount of the BK analog administered and the length of the therapy regime to achieve the desired intravascular concentration is readily determinable by those skilled in the art by routine methods.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0098">The BK analogs may be administered in a pharmaceutical composition in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition may be compounded according to conventional pharmaceutical formulation techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. For a composition to be administered parenterally, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, although other ingredients to aid solubility or for preservation purposes may be included. Injectable suspension may also be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. The preferred parenteral route of administration is intravenous administration.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0099">For intravenous administration, the BK analogs may be dissolved in any appropriate intravenous delivery vehicle containing physiologically compatible substances, such as sterile sodium chloride having a buffered pH compatible with physiologic conditions. Such intravenous delivery vehicles are known to those skilled in the art.</p>

<p id="h-0013" num="0000">A. Inhibition of Platelet Aggregation</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0102">For human platelet aggregation studies, 50 ml human blood was collected into a syringe containing 5 ml of 0.013 M sodium citrate. The anticoagulated blood was centrifuged at 180 xg for 10 minutes at room temperature and the platelet-rich plasma was the supernatant. Platelet aggregation studies in platelet-rich plasma were performed in the cuvette of an aggregometer using &#x3b3;-thrombin (Haematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, Vt.). After standardization of the aggregometer, the threshold dose of &#x3b3;-thrombin, defined as the minimal concentration that will induce full platelet aggregation, was ascertained for each preparation of platelet-rich plasma. Typically, the threshold dose of &#x3b3;-thrombin was between 5 and 30 nM.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0103">Various concentrations of the peptide being tested were added to the platelet-rich plasma in the cuvette of the aggregometer. Platelet aggregation was induced by the addition of &#x3b3;-thrombin. The degree of platelet aggregation was determined by measuring (in arbitrary units) the increase in light transmission through the stirred suspension of platelet-rich plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0104">In a control experiment, the BK fragment SEQ ID NO:7 inhibited &#x3b3;-thrombin-induced (20 nM) platelet aggregation at a concentration of 1 mM peptide.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">B. Inhibition of Platelet Aggregation and Secretion</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0105">For simultaneous platelet aggregation and secretion studies, fresh whole blood was collected and mixed with sodium citrate (final concentration 0.013 M). Platelet-rich plasma was prepared according to the method of Meloni et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>266, 6786, 1991. Washed platelets were prepared by gel filtration over Sepharose 2B columns in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer (0.137 M NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 0.4 mM Na H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 12 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 14.7 mM Hepes containing 20 mM glucose and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.35). Platelets were incubated according to the method of Schmaier et al., <i>Blood </i>56, 1013, 1980 with 5-[<sup>14</sup>C]hydroxytryptamine for 30 min at 37&#xb0; C. The washed platelets (2&#xd7;10<sup>8</sup>/ml, final concentration radiolabeled with 5-[<sup>14</sup>C]hydroxytryptamine) were added to a cuvette of an aggregometer (Chronolog Corp., Havertown, Pa.), standardized using the protocol of Meloni et al., supra. After the addition of ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, final concentration 50 &#x3bc;M, purified HK (1 &#x3bc;M) or various concentrations of the peptides (0.1 to 3 mM) or buffer alone was added to the cuvette. Once the baseline stabilized, &#x3b1;-thrombin [0.125 U/ml (1 nM) final concentration] was then added to initiate platelet activation. Stirred platelets were allowed to incubate with &#x3b1;-thrombin and additions for 1 min. In other experiments, platelets were stimulated with TRAP (0.625 to 2.5 &#x3bc;M), ADP (1-5 &#x3bc;M)(Sigma), collagen (1.25 &#x3bc;g/ml) (Horm, Munich, Germany), or U-46619 (1 &#x3bc;M)(Calbiochem Behring, San Diego, Calif.). Additional experiments were performed with washed platelets stimulated with &#x3b3;-thrombin (1 nM) in the presence of human fibrinogen (100 mg/dl). Both &#x3b3;-thrombin and human fibrinogen were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, Ind. At the conclusion of the incubation, the entire platelet sample was centrifuged at 10,900&#xd7;g (Model E, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, Calif.) over a 0.135 mM formaldehyde, 5 mM EDTA solution (1 part of fornaldehyde-EDTA to 4 parts of platelet suspension) and stored on ice until an aliquot of the supernatant was assayed for 5-[<sup>14</sup>C]hydroxytryptamine secretion. Percent secretion was determined by the ratio of the loss of 5-[<sup>14</sup>C]hydroxytryptamine in the supernatant of the agonist-treated specimen to the total 5-[<sup>14</sup>C]hydroxytryptamine in a platelet suspension of unstimulated platelets after the level of 5-[<sup>14</sup>C]hydroxytryptamine in the supernatant of the unstimulated sample was subtracted from both. Platelet aggregation was measured in arbitrary units as the initial rate of change in light transmittance in the first minute after introduction of agonist.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0106">In a control experiment, native BK (SEQ ID NO:5) inhibited &#x3b1;-thrombin-induced (1 nM) platelet activation with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 0.25 mM and 1.0 mM for 100 percent aggregation and secretion inhibition, respectively.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">C. Inhibition of &#x3b1;-thrombin-induced Calcium Mobilization</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0107">For calcium mobilization studies, the cytoplasmic free Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>],) was measured using the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+ </sup>indicator fura-2 acetyloxymethylester (fura-2 AM, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, Oreg.). Gel filtered platelets in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer were loaded with fura-2 by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. with 1 &#x3bc;M fura-2 AM for 45 min according to the method of Rasmussen et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>268, 14322 (1993). The labeled platelets were then re-gel filtered to remove any excess probe. Aliquots of the labeled platelet suspension were transferred into a quartz cuvette with a magnetic stirrer, which was then placed in a thermostatically controlled chamber at 37&#xb0; C. in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Dual Wave Length Shimazdu SP5000 Spectrofluorometer, Shimazdu USA, Pittsburgh, Pa.). Reagents were directly added to the cuvette. The excitation wave lengths varied between 340 and 380 nm. The fluorescence was measured by recording emitted light at 510 nm as reported by Fisher et al., <i>Mol. Pharm. </i>35, 195 (1989). The minimum emission was determined on a 20 mM digitonin, 10 mM EGTA solubilized platelet sample; maximum emission was determined on the same sample with 10 mM Ca<sup>2+ </sup>added. The intraplatelet free Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration was calculated by the method of Grykiewicz et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>260, 3440 (1985).

Light scatter and fluorescence channels were set at logarithmic gain. Laser excitation was at 488 nm. Green fluorescence was observed through a 525 nm band pass filter. The relative fluorescence intensity of at least 15,000 platelets was analyzed in each sample.

<p id="p-0111" num="0117">The cleavage studies were performed according to the method of Molino et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>270, 11168 (1995). Briefly, NAT12 (SEQ ID NO:2) was dissolved in a solution of 0.01 M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>and 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4. The mixture was then incubated with 8 nM &#x3b1;-thrombin for one hour at 37&#xb0; C. either in the absence (control) or presence of 1 mM of a BK analog. Following incubation, the mixture was applied to a Vyadec C-18 HPLC column in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a gradient from 0% to 100% of 80% MeCN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.

<p id="p-0114" num="0120">Binding assays are used to show protein-protein interactions, and can be used to determine which domains of proteins participate in the binding and to ascertain the relative binding affinity of various domains. Binding assays are also used to screen large numbers of peptides, such as those in a combinatorial library. It is particularly useful to screen peptides for the ability to bind to the NAT12 peptide or to the thrombin receptor. Peptides that show activity in one or more of the binding assays are also tested in one or more of the in vitro functional assays, such as those described in Example 1. A combination of binding and functional assays can be used to identify compounds that selectively inhibit thrombin-induced platelet and other cell activation.</p>

<heading id="h-0023" level="1">In Vivo Clearance and Function: Correlation With In Vitro Results</heading>
<p id="p-0117" num="0123">Clearance studies were performed in New Zealand white rabbits weighing between 2.0 and 2.5 kg. Rabbits were premedicated according to the method of Michelson et al., <i>J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. </i>20, 547 (1988) with 10 mg/kg 1 M xylazine and 10 mg/kg 1 M ketamine. After tracheostomy, intubation, and positive pressure ventilation done with room air (Harvard instruments), stage III surgical anesthesia was maintained with 20 mg/ml of intravenous pentobarbital. A carotid artery and a jugular vein were then exposed. A catheter was inserted into the exposed carotid artery for withdrawal of blood samples and monitoring the animal's blood pressure (Gould, Inc., Cardiovascular Products, Oxnard. Calif.). In a similar manner, a catheter was inserted into the exposed jugular vein for administering the anesthetic and BK analog.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0124">A single intravenous infusion of BK analog was injected. The amount of BK analog injected was calculated from the weight of the animal such that the blood concentration was 1 mM peptide. For example: for a 2.5 kg rabbit, 7% of its weight gives an estimated blood volume of 175 ml. Accordingly, 89 mg of the control BK fragment SEQ ID NO:7 was injected (giving a 1 mM concentration in the 175 ml plasma). Depending upon the size of the animal, 75 to 90 mg peptide was injected. Blood samples were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, and 120 minute intervals after infusion into a 0.013 M sodium citrate anticoagulant solution. Plasma was prepared from each of the blood samples collected over time by centrifugation of the blood samples at 10,000&#xd7;g for two minutes. Aliquots of the plasmas were assayed for the presence of the BK analog antigen by the ELISA technique using a MARKIT-M [1-5] BK assay from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0125">For the function inhibition study, New Zealand white rabbits weighing between 2.0 and 2.5 kg were surgically prepared as described above. After a single bolus infusion of BK analog calculated as described above. 5 ml blood samples were collected at 2. 6, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minute intervals following infusion into a 0.013 M sodium citrate anticoagulant solution. The collected blood samples were centrifuged at 180&#xd7;g (1000 rpms) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) portion of the blood was contained in the supernatant. The platelet count of the PRP, obtained with an H-10 Cell counter (Texas International Laboratories, Inc., Houston, Tex.), was adjusted with rabbit platelet-poor plasma to 200,000-250,000 platelets/&#x3bc;l.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0126">Platelet aggregation studies on the PRP were conducted on a 4-channel aggregometer (BioData-PAP-4, Bio Data Corp., Hatboro, Pa.). The degree of platelet aggregation was determined by measuring the increase in light transmission through a stirred suspension of PRP maintained at 37&#xb0; C. Platelet aggregation was induced in the PRP sample by addition of 20 &#x3bc;M ADP and &#x3b3;-thrombin according to the method of Harfenist et al., <i>Thromb. Haemost. </i>53, 183 (1985).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0127">Like human platelets, rabbit platelets displayed a variable response to &#x3b3;-thrombin. Each rabbit's platelets were evaluated before BK analog infusion for their threshold response to &#x3b3;-thrombin. The rabbit platelets were typically responsive to 10 nM to 40 nM &#x3b3;-thrombin. Simultaneous &#x3b3;-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation studies were performed with 10, 20, and 40 nM &#x3b3;-thrombin and 20 &#x3bc;M ADP.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0128">Control experiments were performed using the BK fragment SEQ ID NO:7. The peak plasma concentration of BK fragment SEQ ID NO:7 after infusion was 60 &#x3bc;g/ml (0.120 mM) for two of three rabbits, as determined by ELISA. No unfavorable effects were observed in the animals following the bolus injection of the BK fragment. The rabbits' blood pressure, pulse, and platelet count remained stable and there was no abnormal bleeding at the surgical sites of cutdowns and intubations. The half-life of BK fragment SEQ ID NO:7 antigen clearance in plasma has two phases: one at 2.8 minutes and a second at 20 minutes after infusion.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0129">The BK fragment SEQ ID NO:7 had a prolonged biologic clearance, however. After a single bolus infusion, 10 nM &#x3b3;-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited 100% for over 4 hours. 20 nM &#x3b3;-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited &#x2267;50% for 2.75 hours, and 40 nM &#x3b3;-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited &#x2267;50% for one hour. There was &#x2267;50% inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation for roughly 45 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0130">These data demonstrate that after a single bolus infusion of BK analog, having a peak peptide concentration of only 0.120 mM two minutes after infusion, there was a prolonged, selective inhibitory effect on thrombin-induced and ADP-induced platelet activation in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0131">When the peptide RPPGF (SEQ ID NO:7) was infused in vivo in rabbits, there was a prolonged inhibition of &#x3b3;-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in rabbit platelet-rich plasma ex vivo, as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0132">A human platelet study was similar to the functional study using white rabbits described above. Briefly, blood samples were obtained from normal human volunteers. Platelet counts were measured with a Coulter counter, Model 2F (Coulter Hialeah, Fla.) and adjusted to a platelet count of 200,000 platelets/&#x3bc;l. Each individual's platelets at baseline were measured for their threshold response to &#x3b3;-thrombin. Typical threshold levels were between 10 nM to 40 nM.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0133">Human platelets in PRP were treated with 20 nM &#x3b3;-thrombin. When 1 mM BK fragment SEQ ID NO:7 was reacted with 20 nM &#x3b3;-thrombin, the aggregation tracing was abolished. The specificity of this reaction was demonstrated by comparing the results to those for a non-BK analog peptide (SEQ ID NO:8). SEQ ID NO:8 (1 mM) was unable to inhibit the ability of &#x3b3;-thrombin to induce platelet activation.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0134">Human platelets were treated with RPPGF (SEQ ID NO:7) in vitro. RPPGF (SEQ ID NO:7) appears to have a prolonged inhibitory effect. Human platelets in platelet-rich plasma were made 1 mM RPPGF (SEQ ID NO:7). After incubation for 1 h at 37&#xb0; C., the platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged into a pellet, the plasma removed, and the pellet was resuspended in platelet-poor plasma without RPPGF (SEQ ID NO:7). After resuspension of the RPPGF-treated platelets in platelet-rich plasma, their ability to respond to &#x3b3;-thrombin was compared with untreated platelet-rich plasma. In all instances examined, the concentration of &#x3b3;-thrombin that served as the threshold to induce full platelet aggregation of RPPGF-treated platelet-rich plasma was greater than that seen with simultaneous control platelet-rich plasma. Further at the concentration of &#x3b3;-thrombin that induced full aggregation of control platelet-rich plasma, each of the RPPGF-treated platelets was inhibited 62% or more. These data indicate that RPPGF (SEQ ID NO:7) bound to platelets actually increased their threshold for platelet aggregation induced by &#x3b3;-thrombin.</p>

<p id="h-0039" num="0000">A. Screening for Ability to Bind the NAT12 Peptide</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0151">Peptides from a combinatorial library are linked to a microtiter plate and blocked with 1% BSA. Biotinylated-NAT12 is incubated with the microtiter plate. After washing, the presence of biotin-NAT12 attached to the matrix support expressing peptides is detected by incubation with ImmunoPure streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockville Ill.) followed by peroxidase-specific fast reacting substrate, turbo-3,3&#x2032;,5,5&#x2032;-tetramethylbenzidine (turbo-TMB, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockville Ill.). After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the color reaction of the turbo-TMB is stopped by the addition of 1 M phosphoric acid. The bound peptide is quantified by measuring the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 450 nm using a Microplate auto reader EL311 (BioTek Instrument, Winooski Vt.). Compounds which bind the NAT12 peptide are also assayed for the ability to inhibit platelet aggregation and the ability to inhibit calcium mobilization, using the assays described in Example 1.</p>
<p id="h-0040" num="0000">B. Screening for Ability to Bind Thrombin Receptor</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0152">Recombinant thrombin receptor is biotinylated, then incubated with peptides from a combinational library on a solid phase matrix support. Binding of the labeled receptor is detected as described above.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a plasticized foil based on partially acetalized polyvinyl alcohols, in particular, based on PVB resin, and suitable as an intermediate layer in laminated safety glass. Laminated safety glass is generally composed of two glass panes and of an adhesive foil bonding the glass panes. The adhesive foil used in the great majority of instances is a foil composed of plasticized partially acetalized polyvinyl alcohols, in particular of polyvinyl butyral (PVB). The laminated safety glass mentioned at the outset is used, by way of example, as windshields or side glazing in the vehicle sector, or else as safety glazing in the construction sector.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Plasticizers used commercially for PVB in conventional PVB foils are mainly aliphatic diesters of tri- or tetraethylene glycols. Among these are 3 GH, 3G7, 3G8, and also 4G7, the prefixed numeral in the these referring to the number n of repeat units H&#x2014;(O&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>&#x2014;OH of the oligoethylene glycol fraction, H referring to 2-ethylbutyrate, 7 to n-heptanoate, and 8 to 2-ethylhexanoate. Other known plasticizers for polyvinyl butyral are, inter alia, dialkyl adipates with aliphatic or cycloaliphatic ester fractions, dialkyl sebacates, triorganophosphates, triorganophosphites, or phthalate plasticizers, such as benzyl butyl phthalate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some plasticizers have only limited compatibility with PVB resins. If compatibility is insufficient, bleed-out of the plasticizer is observed, in particular on heat-aging, and on aging in a moist atmosphere. The compatibility of plasticizers generally falls as the polar character of the plasticizer decreases&#x2014;relatively high-polarity plasticizers having better compatibility the PVB&#x2014;and rises as the polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) content of the PVB resin decreases.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has previously been proposed that triethylene glycol di-2-ethylhexanoate&#x2014;abbreviated to 3G8 or 3GEH&#x2014;could be used as a plasticizer for polyvinyl butyral foils (PVB foil) in order to obtain products with better moisture resistance. However, the apolar character of 3G8 gives it only low compatibility with PVB.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">EP 0 877 665 B1 describes the use of 3G8 as plasticizer in PVB foil for laminated safety glass, the PVOH content of the PVB resin used here having to be below 19.5% by weight. If that is not the case, incompatibility causes bleed-out of the plasticizer. The use of PVB resins with PVOH contents above 19.5% by weight is therefore not possible. Furthermore, comparative experiments show that even if the PVOH content of the PVB resin used is 18.9% by weight the compatibility limit for 3G8 is between 28.5 and 30.5% by weight when the foil has been exposed over a long period to an atmosphere whose relative humidity is 98% at 23&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, PVB resins suitable for PVB foils and having a PVOH content below 19.5% by weight have low commercial availability.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a plasticized foil based on partially acetalized polyvinyl alcohols (PVB resin) which is suitable as an intermediate layer in laminated safety glass and which does not have these disadvantages.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention achieves this object by way of a foil having the features of claim <b>1</b>, preferably combined with one or more features of the subclaims.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The essence of the invention is the use of one or more non-ionic surfactants as an additive increasing the solubility of compatibility of a low-polarity plasticizer in the PVB resin.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The inventive plasticized foil based on partially acetalized polyvinyl alcohols (PVB resin) and suitable as an intermediate layer in laminated safety glass comprises from 60 to 85% by weight of PVB resin, from 14 to 39% by weight of low-polarity plasticizer, and up to 10% by weight of one or more non-ionic surfactants as an additive increasing the solubility of the low-polarity plasticizer in the PVB resin. Besides these, the foil may comprise other additives known to the person skilled in the art, for example residual amounts of water, or else the typical additives known to the person skilled in the art, such as UV absorbers, antioxidants, adhesion regulators, optical brighteners, stabilizers, processing aids, surface-active substances, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Besides the low-polarity plasticizer, use may also be made of standard higher-polarity plasticizers. The greatest advantages result from the inventive addition of the non-ionic surfactant if the amount of low-polarity plasticizer used in the PVB foil is incompatible with the PVB resin without addition of the non-ionic surfactant.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For the quantitative assessment of plasticizer compatibility, or to determine whether a particular amount used of a plasticizer in a particular mixing specification is within or outside the compatibility limit, a standard test termed a spontaneous bleed-out test is used, this test being described in EP 0 877 665 B1=DE 696 09 992 T2. If the plasticizer loss in this test is less than 1% by weight, based on the plasticizer, the plasticizer is regarded as compatible, and if the plasticizer loss is more than 1% by weight it is regarded as incompatible. For rapid qualitative assessment of plasticizer compatibility it is sufficient to store a test strip of a PVB foil in a water-vapor saturated atmosphere. To obtain an atmosphere with high relative humidity (RH), a saturated aqueous solution of copper sulfate pentahydrate with undissolved solid is prepared in a closed vessel, e.g. a glass desiccator. The equilibrium moisture level over this solution at 23&#xb0; C. equates to 98% RH. Absorption of water and the associated polarity increase can displace the plasticizer in low-compatibility systems, and the plasticizer migrates over the course of time to the foil surface, forming a clearly visible film or droplets. In compatible formulations, no plasticizer bleed can be detected on the test strip even after 30 days, whereas it is often apparent after as little as 24 h in the case of incompatible formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The partially acetalized polyvinyl alcohol used preferably comprises a polyinyl butyral with a hydroxy group content greater than 19.5% by weight, calculated to ASTM D1396 as polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), the abbreviated term polyvinyl alcohol content or PVOH content also being used in this application, because the advantage of the inventive addition of non-ionic surfactants can best be utilized with these resins. However, the use of the non-ionic surfactants also, in principle, improves the compatibility in PVB mixing specifications whose polyvinyl alcohol content is below 19.5% by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the non-ionic surfactant used comprises a polyethoxylated aliphatic or aromatic alcohol containing at least 6 carbon atoms in the alcohol fraction, with an average degree of ethoxylation greater than or equal to 2. Particular preference is given to polyethoxylated aliphatic or aromatic alcohols containing from 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the alcohol fraction, with an average degree of ethoxylation of from 3 to 10.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Examples of non-ionic surfactants for the purposes of the invention are MARLOPHEN&#xae; NP 6, a nonylphenol whose average degree of ethoxylation is 6, MARLIPAL&#xae; 0 13/40, a fatty alcohol whose average degree of ethoxylation is 4, ISOFOL&#xae; 12+5 EO, a 2-butyloctanol whose average degree of ethoxylation is 5, all products of Condea. Another example is Berol&#xae; 840, a narrowly distributed tetraethoxylated C8 alcohol from Akzo Nobel.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The amount preferably used of the non-ionic surfactant(s) is from 1 to 9% by weight, in particular from 2 to 4% by weight, based on the total foil mixture. The amount used of the non-ionic surfactant(s) should in all cases be at least sufficient to give complete solubility and therefore compatibility of the plasticizer or plasticizer mixture used in the selected mixing specification.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The ratio of low-polarity plasticizer to the non-ionic surfactant&#x2014;based on the parts by weight in the foil&#x2014;is preferably greater than 2.7:1, in particular greater than 3 and smaller than 10.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is preferable to use triethylene glycol di-2-ethylhexanoate (3G8) as low-polarity plasticizer. However, the invention is not restricted to 3G8, but rather it is also possible to combine the non-ionic surfactants with other plasticizers whose apolar character makes the desired amount incompatible with the PVB resin used.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this description, and in relation to polyvinyl butyral, the plasticizers regarded as low-polarity plasticizers are those whose solubility parameter &#x3b4; at 25&#xb0; C. is smaller than 8.60 (cal/cm<sup>3</sup>)<sup>1/2 </sup>or 17.59 (J/cm<sup>3</sup>) <sup>1/2</sup>. For simplicity, &#x3b4; may be determined from what is known as the Small constants, these being tabulated in &#x201c;L&#xf6;sungsmittel und Weichmachungsmittel&#x201d; [Solvents and plasticizers] (Volume 1, 8th edition, page 593, Gnamm/Fuchs, Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mgH Stuttgart 1980). By way of example, triethylene glycol di-n-heptanoate (3G7) has a &#x3b4; of 8.71 (cal/cm<sup>3</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>, while triethylene glycol di-2-ethylhexanoate (3G8) has a &#x3b4; of 8.51 (cal/cm<sup>3</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The inventive plasticized foil based on partially acetalized polyvinyl alcohols (PVB resin) and suitable as an intermediate layer in laminated safety glass may be further processed with one or more panes of glass in the manner known to the person skilled in the art to give laminated safety glass either for the automotive sector or else for the construction sector.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Methods of Working the Invention and Comparative Experiments</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For the inventive examples E1 to E10 and the comparative examples C1 to C8, plasticized PVB foils were produced in the manner known to the person skilled in the art on a commercially available extruder using a maximum melt temperature of 200&#xb0; C., in order that their bleed-out performance could be tested.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The PVOH content of the PVB resin, the type of non-ionic surfactant used, and its amount were varied in the examples and comparative examples. Experiments were also carried out using 3G8 as the preferred apolar plasticizer incompatible with conventional PVB, and with 3G7 as a plasticizer having good compatibility with standard PVB. The results are presented in tables 1 and 2.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Plasticizer compatibility was determined qualitatively by the following test method: to determine bleed-out performance, a test strip is stored at 23&#xb0; C. in a glass desiccator at 98% relative humidity. Absorption of water and the associated polarity increase can displace the plasticizer in low-compatibility systems, and the plasticizer migrates over the course of time to the foil surface, forming a clearly visible film or droplets. In compatible formulations, no plasticizer bleed can be detected on test strips even after 30 days, whereas it is often apparent after as little as 24 h in the case of incompatible formulations. To obtain an atmosphere with high relative humidity (RH), a saturated aqueous solution of copper sulfate pentahydrate with undissolved solid is prepared in the glass desiccator. The equilibrium moisture level over this solution at 23&#xb0; C. equates to 98% RH.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Example E1 used an amount of 4% by weight of MARLOPHEN&#xae; NP 6, a nonylphenol whose average degree of ethoxylation is 6, as non-ionic surfactant. The foil based on a PVB resin with a PVOH content of 20.3% by weight had 24% by weight content of 3G8 as plasticizer. Due to the inventive use of the hexaethoxylated nonylphenol as non-ionic surfactant, absolutely no plasticizer bleed-out was observed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Examples E2 to E4 used similar mixing specifications with modified amounts of PVOH and of surfactant, the result likewise being absolutely no plasticizer bleed-out.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In contrast to this, a foil of comparative example C1 without surfactant addition exhibits considerable plasticizer loss after a short time, this resulting in visible plasticizer bleed-out.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The mixing specifications used in examples E5 to E10 were similar to those in examples E1 to E4 with other surfactants or amounts of surfactant, the result in each case being absolutely no plasticizer bleed-out. The products used were ISOFOL&#xae; 12+4EO, a 2-butyloctanol whose average degree of ethoxylation is 4, ISOFOL&#xae; 18T+6 EO, a singly branched aliphatic C18 alcohol whose average degree of ethoxylation is 6, MARLIPAL&#xae; O 13/40, a fatty alcohol whose average degree of ethoxylation is 4, MARLIPAL&#xae; O 13/60, a fatty alcohol whose average degree of ethoxylation is 6, ISOFOL&#xae; 12+5 EO, a 2-butyloctanol whose average degree of ethoxylation is 5, and finally Berol&#xae; 840, a narrowly distributed tetraethoxylated C8 alcohol.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Comparative example C2 demonstrated that the addition of 4% by weight of the standard plasticizer 3G7 instead of the non-ionic surfactant used according to the invention cannot prevent the bleed-out of the plasticizer 3G8.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Experiments C2 to C3 tested the compatibility limit with respect to amounts of 3G8 for a PVB with very low PVOH content of 18.9% by weight without the inventive addition of a non-ionic surfactant: above about 29% by weight 3G8 content, bleed-out of the plasticizer occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Comparative examples C6 to C8 show that insufficient amounts of non-ionic surfactants, in this case below 1% by weight, have inadequate action in preventing plasticizer loss, in particular in the case of a PVB with relatively high PVOH content of 20.5% by weight. However, even these examples showed less plasticizer loss than example C1 without the addition of non-ionic surfactants.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to devices, techniques, and treatments for reducing or eliminating electromagnetic interference.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Relevant Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electromagnetic interference (EMI) can arise in any electronic system, either directly from circuitry or indirectly by conduction along connecting cables and by radiation. EMI can also arise from external sources to create problems in various systems. Undesirable signals occur whenever interference has a source, a receiver, and a transfer path. Accordingly, EMI can be reduced or eliminated by suppressing interference at the source, protecting the receiver against interference, and by reducing transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Interference can propagate by radiation of electromagnetic waves in free space and by conduction on a conductive pathway. Techniques for suppressing radiated interference include shielding with conductive or absorbing materials such as conductive adhesive tapes, wire mesh, and gaskets. Techniques for suppressing conducted interference includes ferromagnetic cable shields, connector backshields, filtered connectors, ferrite toroids, and feedthrough capacitors that all reduce emissions conducted onto connecting cables. Conducted emissions generally concern signal frequencies of up to 30 MHz while radiated emissions have a frequency range of generally over 30 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Electromagnetic compatibility is regulated throughout the world. European Norms (EN) define regulations applicable in all European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Associated (EFTA) countries. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates electromagnetic compatibility in the United States. Other agencies regulate emissions in other countries throughout the world.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Fundamentally, EMI should be addressed using good design practice to eliminate interference in design requirements. Design practice may be ineffective for interference that is directly related to inherent operating principles and for interference that is not detected until the final design phase. Further, combining components into systems not originally anticipated may cause unexpected EMI problems. Additional suppression may be needed using extra suppression components such as ferrites, capacitors, or shielding elements.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a pictorial diagram illustrates several examples of conventional wire and cable shielding devices including toroids. Conventional techniques for improving electromagnetic noise emission involve placement of a ferrite toroid on the wire or cable. The toroid solution reduces EMI in some frequency ranges but has the disadvantages of increased material costs, increased assembly costs, and difficulty in installation from complexity in routing and dressing. Toroids are inconvenient since a cable that is intended to pass through a hole of only slightly larger diameter than the cable can no longer pass when the toroid is installed. A toroid is a ring-shaped solid lossy element that is commonly manufactured by combining a ferromagnetic powder into a substrate, and placing the combination into a mold for sintering at high pressure and temperature. One or more toroids can be placed around the cable, either by sliding the ring over the end of a cable or by snapping a split toroid into place on the cable. Toroids are typically ceramics that have the disadvantage of high fragility; the ferrite material commonly used for toroids can fracture in use. A fractured toroid has greatly reduced attenuation capability. For long cables, multiple toroids must be used to remedy differential-to-common mode conversion, increasing cost and complexity while reducing reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Toroids can be porous, possibly resulting in moisture absorption or requiring shrink tubing overlying the toroids for physical and moisture protection. Other, similar applications of solid lossy materials have similar problems of cost, fragility, and installation difficulty.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to some embodiments of the disclosed EMI reduction system and method, an apparatus comprises a conductor and a lossy coating encasing the conductor and comprising one or more lossy layers. The one or more lossy layers further comprise a binder and a lossy material mixed into the binder. The lossy material is selected to attenuate electromagnetic interference frequencies in a narrow or moderate band.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to other embodiments, an electromagnetic interference-protected cable comprises one or more interior conductor cables, a shield coupled to and encasing the one or more interior conductor cables, and a plurality of lossy layers coupled to and encasing the shield and the one or more interior conductor cables. The individual lossy layers of the plurality of lossy layers have different compositions selected to attenuate frequencies in multiple frequency bands.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to further embodiments, a method for protecting against electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic pulse signals comprises determining an interference frequency band within which electromagnetic interference is to be attenuated. The method further comprises mixing a lossy material into a binder in a composition and concentration that attenuates electromagnetic interference in the determined frequency band and forming the mixed lossy material and binder over a conductor.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">What is desired is an apparatus and method capable of improving the reduction or elimination of electromagnetic interference and similar applications of solid lossy material. What is further desired is an EMI solution that avoids the difficulties imposed by toroids.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A coating comprised of one or more layers of lossy material with specified frequency characteristics encases a conductor such as a wire or cable to reduce electromagnetic emissions. A lossy material can be incorporated into a binder to form wire insulation or a cable jacket in the one or more layers to dissipate radio frequency (RF) energy that can radiate from the wire or cable to cause electromagnetic interference (EMI). In addition to reducing or eliminating EMI radiated by product or system, shielding using the specified lossy materials can enhance noise immunity, reducing susceptibility to externally generated electromagnetic fields and sources.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, a single lossy material layer encases the wire or cable with the lossy material selected and implemented with particular characteristics to reduce or eliminate electromagnetic interference within a selected frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other embodiments, the wire insulation or cable jacket is implemented with multiple lossy layers using one or more lossy materials to reduce or eliminate interference in an entire frequency spectrum of interest. Typically, the various layers of the two or more lossy layers are selected to have different frequency response characteristics to broaden the band of frequencies of the electromagnetic interference. Application of multiple lossy layers permits selection of materials that have higher losses over a narrow frequency range, increasing the total attenuation of EMI. Electromagnetic interference generally encompasses a wide band of frequencies so that a lossy wire insulator or cable jacket should eliminate or reduce interference throughout a wide frequency range. With a single lossy layer, a broadband material is to be used to eliminate interference in as wide a frequency range as is possible. Broadband materials by nature do not have as high an attenuation at specific frequencies as materials intended for a narrower bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The individual layers of the multiple lossy coatings can be designed to reduce or eliminate interference at selected frequency bands by choice of materials and control of properties and densities of the chosen materials.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Multiple coatings in separate sheaths coupled in adjacent layers can produce a greater attenuation than the same materials mixed in the same matrix. Multiple layer shielding permits usage of narrow spectrum absorbers to increase attenuation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Application of multiple lossy layers permits selection of particular lossy materials to enhance reduction of particular problematic frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A cable and wire coating system that enables usage of multiple coating layers and specification of the frequency coverage of the individual layers allows a manufacturer to flexibly supply EMI reduction materials for a broad range of applications and frequency bands while stocking a low number of lossy materials.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Lossy material can be incorporated into the insulation or jacket by mixing into a molten thermoplastic insulating material or by extruding the lossy material or otherwise applying the lossy material around the cable or wire.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Enclosing the wire or cable in multiple lossy layers improves electromagnetic noise emission in comparison to conventional techniques that involve placement of a ferrite toroid on the wire or cable. The toroid solution does reduce or eliminate EMI in some frequency ranges but has the disadvantages of increased material costs, increased assembly costs, and difficulty in installation from complexity in routing and dressing. Toroids are also inconvenient since a cable that is intended to pass through a hole of only slightly larger diameter than the cable can no longer pass when the toroid is installed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The lossy layers can be incorporated into cables with or without a metallic shield.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a highly schematic pictorial diagram illustrates an example of a shielded wire or cable <b>100</b> that is shielded by a shield braid <b>106</b> and a coating <b>110</b> comprising one or more lossy layers <b>112</b>. The one or more lossy layers <b>112</b> are concentrically positioned around the core <b>108</b>. The lossy layers <b>112</b> includes lossy material with specified frequency characteristics and encases an electrically conductive core of wire or cable <b>108</b> to reduce electromagnetic emissions. Typically, the wire or cable <b>108</b> is used to transmit electrical signals and/or electrical power with the coating <b>110</b> isolating the wire or cable <b>108</b> from the exterior environment, either protecting the conductive core <b>108</b> from ambient electromagnetic emissions or protecting the external environment from EMI from the core <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The electrically conductive core of wire or cable <b>108</b> typically is composed of circularly-sectioned drawn wire stock of an electrically conductive material selected for conductivity, weight, compatibility and cost. Suitable electrically conductive materials include copper, silver, gold, and other conductive metals and alloys.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The shield braid <b>106</b> is typically constructed from a lightweight, metallized, high-tensile strength fiber that is braided or formed into a mesh. In some examples, the braid <b>106</b> is from about 1 to approximately 10 mils thick. A suitable material for the braid <b>106</b> is silver-coated aramid fiber braid. Other high-tensile fibers include nylon, nomex, and the like. In various embodiments, the shield braid <b>106</b> can be formed concentrically above or below the coating <b>110</b>. The shield braid <b>106</b>, like the coating <b>110</b>, functions to shield against interference signals.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Braid <b>106</b> functions as a shield around the conductor <b>108</b> in the form of wire braid wire strands overlaid around the conductor <b>108</b>. Current flowing in the conductor <b>108</b> can generate a current flowing in the shield braid <b>106</b>, possibly causing the braid <b>106</b> to radiate energy for long lengths of wire or cable. Radiation can cause the braid <b>106</b> to lose effectiveness in reducing interference. The one or more lossy layers <b>112</b> reduce or prevent energy radiation, effectively reducing interference.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Some embodiments of a cable may omit the braid <b>106</b>. For example, in some applications such as cabling between two isolated equipment units, a conductive braid <b>106</b> is not desirable since a conductive path between chassis of the two units can be detrimental to operation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Any suitable lossy material such as a ferrite or other lossy material can be incorporated into wire insulation or cable jacket <b>112</b> in the one or more layers to dissipate radio frequency (RF) energy that can radiate from the wire or cable <b>108</b> to cause electromagnetic interference (EMI). Typical ferrite materials that can be incorporated into the one or more lossy layers <b>112</b> include nickel-zinc (NiZn) ferrites, manganese-zinc (MnZn) ferrites, and others. Particular NiZn and MnZn materials can be fabricated to have various selected proportions of the composite elements and to have various selected densities in a base material to attain particular attenuation performance at particular frequency bands.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Base material of the lossy layers <b>112</b> is a binder that can be composed of a flexible insulating material, the particular material being selected based on considerations of insulative properties, weight, flexibility and cost. The base material typically comprises an elastomer or thermoplastic material such as poly-vinyl-chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), or other suitable materials.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The one or more lossy layers <b>112</b> reduce or eliminate EMI radiated by a product or system at the frequency bands and at the attenuation levels according to the particular configuration of one or more lossy material layers, and can enhance noise immunity by reducing susceptibility to externally-generated electromagnetic fields and sources.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the illustrative wire or cable <b>100</b>, a single lossy material layer <b>112</b> encases the wire or cable <b>108</b> with the lossy material selected and implemented with particular characteristics to reduce or eliminate electromagnetic interference within a selected frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The one or more layers <b>112</b> of the coating <b>110</b> typically are comprised of the base material or binder with embedded lossy material particles, for example embedded metal particles. Some manufacturing methods comprise mixing metal particles into the base material in the form of a flowable liquid component that is elastomeric in a solid state.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The coating <b>110</b> comprises one or more layers <b>112</b> of a binder loaded with a lossy material concentrically disposed about the inner conductor <b>108</b> creating an isotropic conductivity that is desirable in an effective Faraday shield.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The binder can be composed of one or more of a variety of elastomers, thermoplastics, and other materials. Suitable thermoplastics include poly-vinyl-chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and other specially formulated plastics. PVC is flexible, resists weathering and ultraviolet rays that degrade many plastics, and is available in a wide range of durability and hardness varieties from hard and stiff to soft and spongy. PE is inexpensive with good chemical and weathering resistance, and has a wide variety of hardness from stiff to flexible, depending on wall thickness. PP has good abrasion and chemical resistance but poor ultraviolet and weathering resistance. PP is lightweight and easy to process. PVC, PE, and PP have generally average operating temperature ranges of about 35&#xb0; C. to 95&#xb0; C. Specially formulated plastics are available such as Lolon&#xa9; varieties A, B, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M from Loos &#x26; Co. of Pomfret, Conn., that have selected characteristics of impact, fatigue, abrasion, chemical, moisture, mildew, fungus, and weathering resistance, flexibility, toughness, hardness, rigidity, and operating temperature range.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The binder can further be composed of other thermoplastic resins such as polycarbonates, polyesters, polyetheresters, polyestercarbonates, polyamides, polyamideimides, polystyrenes, polyethers, polyetherimides, polyaryleneethers, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymers, and combinations of two or more thermoplastic resins. U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,737 to Elkovitch entitled &#x201c;EMI-Shielding Thermoplastic Composition, Method for the Preparation Thereof, and Pellets and Articles Derived Therefrom&#x201d;, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, describes the thermoplastic resins and manufacturing techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The binder can also be a polymeric matrix such as Viton, a fluorinated elastomeric polymer manufactured by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington, Del.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Material used in the binder may include materials selected for lossy characteristics and permeability characteristics. Various lossy materials may be used such as nickel-zinc (NiZn) ferrites, manganese-zinc (MnZn) ferrites, flakes of magnetic amorphous alloy, and other ferrites. Permeable materials may be used including high permeability iron-based (ferrous) alloy, high permeability iron-based alloy such as 4&#x2013;79 Permalloy, MUMETAL&#xae;, Hymu 80, 45 Permalloy, and 50% nickel iron. The lossy materials may be either magnetically soft or can have some degree of hardness. Suitable magnetic materials can further include ferromagnetics, nickel, iron, nickel-iron alloys, silicon-iron alloys, cobalt-iron alloys, and steel. Suitable steels are those that are naturally ferromagnetic or processed to become ferromagnetic. Nickel-iron alloys have several identification or trade names including mumetal, permalloy, supermalloy, supermumetal, nilomag, sanbold, and others. In some examples, the lossy materials may be metal coated. Metal-coated lossy particles can be fabricated using techniques such as electrodeposition, vacuum deposition, and other known methods.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, a mixture of lossy materials and high permeability materials may be used. For example one layer may be composed of lossy materials and a second layer may include high permeability materials such as MUMETAL to dissipate interference.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In applications that include multiple layers, some layers may include lossy materials and other layers may include high permeability materials that are selected in combination to attain selected performance characteristics. In other applications, lossy and high permeability materials may be included in one or more layers.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some cases, the lossy materials can be silver-coated magnetic particles such as ferrites, magnetites or a blend of ferrites and magnetites. Impedance characteristics of the magnetic particles vary based on composition, fabrication conditions, concentration, and the like. Ferrites are soft-magnetic, homogeneous ceramic materials that are typically composed of iron oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) with carbonates or oxides of one or more bivalent metals such as manganese, zinc, nickel, or magnesium.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the lossy layer <b>112</b> can be constructed of ferromagnetic particles mixed with other metal particles including one or more of copper, silver, silver-coated copper, nickel, manganese, zinc, and others into a polymer matrix. For example, metal-coated ferrites and magnetites can be mixed with the other metal particles. For a lossy layer <b>112</b> that includes ferromagnetic materials mixed into the polymer matrix in combination with other metal particles, the matrix comprises approximately 10 to 90% by weight of the metal blend. The metal coating on the particles can range from approximately 5% to 95% of the entire particle weight.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the one or more lossy layers <b>112</b> of the coating <b>110</b> include an electromagnetic shielding agent that comprises metal-coated particles in combination with metal particles. Suitable core materials for the metal-coated particles include vitreous mineral such as glass, silicates of aluminum, magnesium, calcium, and similar elements. Other suitable core materials include inorganic carbon materials such as kevlar, graphite, carbon powders, carbon particles, mica, and composites. The metal coating is any metal capable of enhancing the shield effectiveness of thermoplastic resins, for example silver, gold, copper, aluminum, nickel, platinum, and alloys of one or more of the listed metals. A particular example is silver-coated vitreous mineral particle. The metal content of the metal-coated particles may range from about 1 to about 30 weight percent, based on the total weight of the metal-coated particle. Metal-coated particles may have a concentration in the layer <b>112</b> in a range from about 0.1 to approximately 30% of the total composition weight. The metal particles in the electromagnetic shielding agent may be any conductive metal, alloy, or combination of one or more of iron, copper, aluminum, nickel, and titanium. A specific example is a stainless steel alloy of iron with chromium, nickel, carbon, manganese, and molybdenum.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The lossy coating <b>110</b> can be used to cover wires or cables for any application, for example including local area network (LAN) cables, interconnect cables, power cables, or any other type of cable. The lossy coating <b>110</b> is useful in any interconnect cable where noise emission is an issue, including all computer applications of serial cables, centronics/parallel ports, Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) cables, LAN cables, telephone and telecommunications cables, power cables. Other applicable computer cables include A-D converters, signal lines, measuring circuits, RF cables, sound card cables, modem lines, DMA cables, PCMCIA cables, NIC's, token ring, fiber channel, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and subsequent figures are single-conductor wires or cables, other embodiments may include single, dual, or multiple conductors. The lossy coating <b>110</b> can be used on power conductors, for example &#x201c;Romex&#x201d; conductors and can be used on heavy, high-current conductors or bus bars. In addition to tubular cable shielding for coaxial cable, the lossy wire or cable coating can also be applied to rectangular cores for flat ribbon cables</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a pictorial diagram depicts coating <b>212</b> in the form of wire insulation or cable jacket with multiple lossy layers <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> using one or more lossy materials to reduce or eliminate interference in an entire frequency spectrum of interest. Although two lossy sheaths <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> are shown, any suitable number of layers may be implemented. Some examples may include three or four layers, other examples include additional layers to achieve particular frequency and attenuation performance. The number of lossy layers may be optimized depending on the application to attain desired frequency performance and attenuation goals while taking into account manufacturing complexity and cost.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Various layers of the two or more lossy layers <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> can be selected to have different frequency response characteristics to broaden the band of frequencies of the electromagnetic interference to be reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although the illustrative pictorial diagram includes a braid shield <b>106</b>, in some applications the braid shield <b>106</b> may be omitted to attain a desired functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, frequency response graphs show the relationship of attenuation and frequency for the multiple lossy layers <b>214</b> and <b>216</b>. Lossy materials can be designed using selected materials that individually have higher losses over narrow frequency ranges <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> that overlap, increasing the total attenuation of EMI when combined <b>314</b>. The layer for low frequency attenuation <b>310</b> has a peak response at a low frequency and the layer for high frequency attenuation <b>312</b> has a peak response for high frequency interference. The combination of layers has a combined frequency attenuation that overlaps and generates a relatively high attenuation across an entire wide frequency band. Electromagnetic interference generally encompasses a wide band of frequencies so that a lossy wire insulator or cable jacket should eliminate or reduce interference throughout a wide frequency range. In comparison, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, with a single lossy layer a broadband material is to be used to eliminate interference in as wide a frequency range as possible <b>320</b>. Broadband materials generally have difficulty eliminating interference at a particular frequency. The attenuation effect of the multiple lossy layers <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> in combination is greater than the attenuation of the single broadband lossy material layer.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The individual layers of the multiple lossy coatings can be designed to reduce or eliminate interference at selected frequency bands <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> by choosing materials and controlling properties and densities of the chosen materials.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The illustrative cable with multiple lossy layers, each having different frequency attenuation characteristics improves over a broadband solution by increasing the maximum attenuation capability. Coating volume limits the amount of lossy material that can be disposed about the cable. For short cables, the total coating volume may be insufficient to carry enough lossy material to attain the desired attenuation while maintaining a flexible cable that is not too stiff, bulky, or difficult to manufacture. Usage of multiple lossy layers with different frequency attenuation characteristics increases the overall attenuation in comparison to broadband attenuation so that sufficient attenuation may be attained even for short cables.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Frequency attenuation of a particular lossy layer can be controlled by selection of the particular lossy materials and lossy material concentrations in a layer. For example, ferrite is particularly suited for operation under a frequency range from about 10 kHz to approximately 50 MHz. Manganese-zinc (Mn&#x2014;Zn) ferrites attenuate at relatively lower frequencies in a range up to approximately 50 MHz. Nickel-zinc (Ni&#x2014;Zn) ferrites, in contrast, attenuate at higher frequency ranges up to approximately 100 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Ferromagnetic resonance permeability effects the frequency attenuation of a particular layer which, in turn, depends on selection of the particular lossy material, other materials included in the layer, lossy material concentration, physical characteristics of the lossy material within a layer including the size of lossy particles. Low frequency signals are typically unaffected by cable shielding. At low frequencies, a lossy material causes a low-loss inductance, resulting in a minor impedance increase. At higher frequencies where interference becomes common, magnetic losses increase and the ferromagnetic resonance permeability frequency falls to about zero while impedance reaches a maximum value. Impedance largely determines suppression and becomes almost completely resistive at higher frequencies, even capacitive with losses at very high frequencies. Effective interference suppression can be attained at operating frequencies much higher than the resonance frequency even though the operating frequency should remain below the resonance frequency for inductor applications. Impedance peaks at the resonance frequency and the lossy material is effective for noise suppression in a wide frequency band around resonance.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Near the ferromagnetic resonance, impedance is predominantly resistive which is favorable since a low-loss inductor can resonate with a capacitance in series, resulting in a near zero impedance and interference amplification. A more resistive impedance cannot resonate and is reliable independent of source and load impedances. Furthermore, a resistive impedance dissipates rather than reflects interference. Oscillations at high frequency can damage semiconductors or alter circuit operations and are thus better absorbed. In addition, the impedance curve shape changes with material losses. A lossy material will have a smooth variation of impedance with frequency and a real wideband attenuation. Interference signals typically occur in a broad spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The lossy material in a layer is selected to attain a particular frequency attenuation. For example, Nickel-Zinc (NiZn) ferrites can be used for EMI suppression up to gigahertz frequencies and have a high resistivity that prevents eddy current induction. Manganese-Zinc (MnZn) materials have high permeability but low resistivity and generally suppress EMI in a lower frequency range. Iron powder has low permeability but a lower bandwidth than for NiZn due to low resistivity. Iron powders have a very high saturation flux density and thus are suitable for very high bias currents.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, flux curves for a three-layer EMI reduction cable illustrate system hysteresis. The multiple layers are constructed to have differing frequency attenuation performance. The ordinate axis depicts flux as a function of the field, on the abscissa, into which the lossy material is immersed. The response curve depicts the flux inside the lossy material. As the field is increased, the flux within the lossy material increases but levels at some point of magnification. As the field is decreased, the curve does not retrace the magnification response but instead show a hysteresis or energy loss. For any lossy material, the larger the area of hysteresis depicts a greater lossy character of the material. Materials with varying lossy character have differing frequency attenuation characteristics, as shown in the frequency response diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. In some embodiments, what are desired in a particular group of lossy material layers are a relatively large loss and a relatively narrow frequency range for the individual layers.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a pictorial diagram shows an example of a five layer EMI reduction cable <b>500</b> that protects three insulated cables or wires <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, and <b>506</b>. The illustrative five-layer shield <b>500</b> produces a frequency characteristic depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Multiple coatings in separate sheaths <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, and <b>520</b> overlying an optional braid shield <b>508</b> and coupled in adjacent layers can produce a greater attenuation than the same materials mixed in the same matrix. Multiple layer shielding permits usage of narrow spectrum absorbers <b>612</b>, <b>614</b>, <b>616</b>, <b>618</b>, and <b>620</b> to increase overall attenuation <b>610</b>. Application of multiple lossy layers can permit selection of particular lossy materials to enhance reduction of particular problematic frequencies, for example in ranges <b>630</b> and <b>632</b>. In the illustrative example, the multiple coatings in separate sheaths <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, and <b>520</b> enables heightened attenuation of noise in particular predetermined ranges by integrating layers that attenuate at low frequency, high frequency, and several mid-range bands through usage of different lossy materials and/or concentrations in the various lossy layers.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The illustrative cable and wire coating system enables design of multiple coating layers <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, and <b>520</b> and specification of the frequency coverage of the individual layers, thereby improving flexibility and efficiency, and reducing complexity, cost, and variety of inventory. A manufacturer can flexibly supply shielding materials for a broad range of applications and frequency bands while stocking a low number of lossy materials.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Although five layers are shown, any number of layers may be formed depending on the particular application, the frequencies to be attenuated, desired amount of attenuation, and suitable physical characteristics of the cable including flexibility, hardness, and weather and abrasion resistance. Generally up to 10 dB or more of attenuation are gained by a lossy layer. The number of layers may also be determined based on cost and manufacturing difficulty.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The illustrative lossy coating can be used for many purposes in many applications, for example in automotive, aviation, aerospace, military, industrial, power distribution, measurement/control, retail, commercial, transportation, entertainment, computer, communications, residential such as &#x201c;smart house&#x201d; applications, home entertainment, and other fields. The lossy coating can be used for telecommunications for radar, broadcast, and frequencies up to microwave. Automotive applications include but are not limited to ignition, control, interface, diagnostics, on-board entertainment, self-test. Military applications further include maritime and shipboard applications.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The lossy coatings can be used to shield sensitive systems, for example measuring circuits, high impedance circuits, and the like from incoming noise, enhancing noise immunity or decreasing susceptibility.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a highly schematic pictorial diagram illustrates an example of an unshielded wire or cable <b>700</b> with a coating <b>710</b> comprising one or more lossy layers <b>712</b>. The one or more lossy layers <b>712</b> are concentrically positioned around the core <b>708</b>. The lossy layers <b>712</b> includes lossy material with specified frequency characteristics and encases an electrically conductive core of wire or cable <b>708</b> to reduce electromagnetic emissions. Shielding may be omitted, for example, if the two components, devices, or systems that are connected by the cable <b>700</b> are isolated. Shielding can be omitted to avoid electrical connection of the two isolated housings.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a schematic circuit diagram shows an example of an equivalent circuit <b>800</b> for an interference protection cable using multiple lossy layers. The circuit diagram shows resistive (R), inductive (L), conductive (G), and capacitance (C) components combined into single components for the multiple lossy layers. The individual lossy layers <b>802</b> and <b>804</b> have different equivalent circuit components depending on the lossy materials within the layers.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The resistance R, capacitance C, and frequency f determine the propagation velocity Vp of the different cable portions. Low resistance and low capacitance cables have a higher velocity than cables with higher values of resistance or capacitance. Lossy layers form a relatively large inductance, causing the product of frequency and inductance to be much greater than resistance. The differing materials in the individual lossy layers create various contributions to the equivalent circuit in terms of resistive (R), inductive (L), conductive (G), and capacitance (C) components, resulting in multiple cascaded filter functions in the cable.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The usage of cables with one or more layers of lossy material improves EMI reduction performance as compared to cables with toroids. Toroids or local filtering reduces but does not eliminate interference so that noise signals may be carried by the metal shielding are radiated. The described cables eliminate EMI along the entire length of cabling.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In similar applications, lossy layers can be formed as a layer of a wall, for example by application to any suitable support member such as a woven rope, a heavy sheet, a sheet of metal, or any other suitably strong member.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The one or more lossy layers can continuously cover the isolated element such as cable or sheet, or can have one or more splits or gaps. Any gap should be sufficiently small to permit complete lines of flux that completely encircle a conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Lossy material can be incorporated into the insulation or jacket by mixing into a molten thermoplastic insulating material or by extruding the lossy material or otherwise applying the lossy material around the cable or wire.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Cables with lossy layers extending along the cable length improve dissipation performance in comparison to usage of toroids or local filters on the basis that the toroids or local filters do not eliminate but simply reduce the amplitude of unwanted signals at the toroid or filter location. The reduced amplitude signals can propagate along cable shielding and radiate electromagnetic emissions. Longitudinal conversion loss measures balance between two individual conductors in a twisted pair. When conductors in a pair are mirror images, voltage returning down the conductors is equal, improving voltage cancellation and reducing radiation of electromagnetic emissions. Lossy layers extending throughout the cable improves balance and longitudinal conversion loss characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The lossy layers <b>112</b> can be manufactured using various techniques including layering, extruding, coating, wrapping, and the like, over the electrically conductive core <b>108</b>. For example, a die commonly used in cable manufacture extrudes molten or semi-molten plastic over the conductive cores. The extrusion flows around the conductive core wires and cools during extrusion. For multiple layers, the cables pass through the extrusion process multiple times.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Extrusion is the process of forming a concentric pile of successive cured and hardened extrusions in the radial outward direction. Extrusions can be made as part of the manufacturing process for shielded cables and shielded housings for constituent cable subassemblies. The binder can be an extrudable, cure-hardened material that includes, before extrusion, a flowable resin component and a non-flowable component with resin particles that have been preliminarily cured and hardened and are pressure distortable. Typically, the lossy materials, when mixed with particular polymers, form easily extrudable compounds that are highly suitable for application to wires and cables. The lossy material-polymer mixture can be directly extruded over wire to form a combination that attenuates or filters high frequency interference on the cable line. High frequency signals conducted down the cable are partially absorbed by the lossy particle shield layer. Electromagnetic waves penetrating through to the shielding layer <b>112</b> are at least partially absorbed by the lossy particles and dissipated by lattice vibration or phonon emission. The shielding layer <b>112</b> protects against radio frequency propagating down the wire.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In a particular embodiment, ferrous alloy particles are mixed with a size range of 10&#x2013;20 grains per square millimeter at a selected concentration, for example in a range of 5% to 85% by volume, with the binder, extrude the admixture and cure-harden, giving good homogenous (isotropic) conductivity throughout the material. The type and proportion of metal particles determines the frequency attenuation and shielding effectiveness of the individual layers.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The particles of lossy material can be loaded into the thermoplastic mixture during sheath formation by a conventional extrusion process that further includes sheath curing and hardening.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The various components can be manufactured as a single unit by sequentially extruding the concentric pile of sheaths or layers about the conductor. Alternatively, components can be manufactured separately and then assembled to form a completed cable.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The illustrative cables and lossy materials can be used in various applications, for example TEMPEST applications in which materials are selected for a wide range of radiation spectra. TEMPEST is the code name for technology capable of limiting unwanted electromagnetic emissions from data processing and related equipment. The TEMPEST goal is limiting an intruder's capability to collect information from the internal data flow of computer equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">TEMPEST technology is important for computers and other data processing equipment since such devices communicate using square wave signals and clock speeds that produce a particularly rich set of unintentional signals in a wide portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Spurious emissions occupy so wide a portion of the frequency spectrum that technologies for blocking one portion are not necessarily effective in another portion. Unintentional emissions from a computer system can be intercepted and decoded to give information from simple activity levels to remote copying of keystrokes or monitor information capture. Poorly protected systems can be effectively monitored for distances up one or more kilometers.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">TEMPEST is intended to protect systems susceptible to intrusion or damage from Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), including the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from nuclear weapons. To ensure communications security, TEMPEST is to prevent compromising emanations. Many defense-related facilities require EMI, EMP, or TEMPEST protection. Historically, a metallic liner or shield has provided protection by completely enclosing the electronics systems. The conservative designs typically provide more shielding than required and are very expensive to design, construct, test, and maintain.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (CERL) has experimented with low-cost electromagnetic shielding designs for several years including shielding materials such as conductive polymers, amorphous metals and intercalated graphites, and advanced coatings for use on shield components. CERL has also investigated inherent shielding of standard construction materials including aluminum-foil-backed gypsum board, aluminum-foil-backed insulating sheathing, metallic-clad siding, copper foils normally used for vapor barriers, wire meshes, and sheet metal roofing.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The illustrative lossy materials can be used to reduce EMI and EMP in TEMPEST applications.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Many variations, modifications, additions and improvements of the embodiments described are possible. For example, those skilled in the art will readily implement the steps necessary to provide the structures and methods disclosed herein, and will understand that the process parameters, materials, and dimensions are given by way of example only and can be varied to achieve the desired structure as well as modifications which are within the scope of the invention. For example, although the illustrative cables have a round cross section, in other embodiments various other types of cables such as flat or ribbon cables may be coated with lossy materials. Various combinations of lossy layers and high permeability layers may be used.</p>

No. 6,881,940 which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. P11-218349 filed on Aug. 2, 1999, the above-referenced disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an image processing apparatus and method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A technique of arithmetically operating an image signal is being spread widely. This technique is utilized, for example, to determine a three-dimensional image of an imaging object by arithmetically operating an image signal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to obtain a plurality of signals necessary for arithmetic operation, where such an image pickup device as a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) is used, an image of an imaging object is picked up repetitively. Image signals obtained by the repetitive image picking up operations are stored into a memory device such as a frame memory. Then, the thus stored signals are read out from the storage device and used for such arithmetic operation as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also such a non-scanning type image pickup device as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. hei 6-25653 has been proposed as a method and an apparatus for realizing real-time geometric measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, where an image of an imaging object is picked up repetitively, since the time of, for example, 33.3 msec or 16.6 msec is required for a single image picking up operation, there is a subject to be solved that this time required for the image pickup makes an upper limit and a result of arithmetic operation of image information cannot be obtained at a higher rate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also it is a subject to be solved that, since a result of arithmetic operation of an image signal cannot be obtained unless an image picking up operation is performed repetitively, a result of arithmetic operation cannot be obtained on the real-time basis.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the non-scanning type image pickup device disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. hei 6-25653, since outputs of individual pixels arrayed on the image pickup device are handled independently of one another, output signal lines of the pixels cannot be formed as a common output signal line or lines. Further, since the non-scanning type image pickup device does not include storage means for the pixels, it has a subject to be solved that it loses such a characteristic of the &#x201c;non-scanning type&#x201d; that individual pixels operate independently of one another and consequently cannot perform real-time processing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to provide an image processing apparatus and method wherein image signals obtained by photoelectric conversion of light received individually by elements for receiving light from an object to be imaged can be arithmetically processed on the real-time basis.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to attain the object described above, according to the present invention, image signals obtained by photoelectric conversion of light received individually by elements for receiving light from an object to be imaged are arithmetically operated in accordance with a predetermined rule.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The arithmetic operation means may include storage means for successively storing a plurality of signals at different timings obtained by the photoelectric conversion. In this instance, the arithmetic operation means may execute comparison arithmetic operation for a combination of a plurality of ones of the signals stored in the storage means. The comparison arithmetic operation may include an arithmetic operation for determining a maximum value or a minimum value of the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The outputting means may output results of the arithmetic operation for each of the rows or the columns of the elements at a timing adjusted by the timing adjustment means.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image processing method for an image processing apparatus which has an optical area in which a plurality of elements are disposed in a matrix, comprising a light reception step of receiving light introduced into the elements of the optical area and photoelectrically converting the light, an arithmetic operation step of arithmetically operating a signal obtained for each of the elements by the photoelectric conversion of the processing in the light reception step in accordance with a predetermined rule, an outputting step of outputting a result of the arithmetic operation of the processing in the arithmetic operation step for each of the elements, and a timing adjustment step of adjusting a timing at which the result of the arithmetic operation is to be outputted for each of the plurality of elements by the processing in the outputting step.</p>

Then, a result of the arithmetic operation is outputted for each of the elements. Consequently, arithmetic operation processing of image information can be performed on the real-time basis.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown an image processing apparatus to which the present invention is applied. The image processing apparatus shown is generally denoted at 1 and includes a pattern light projection section <b>12</b>, an imager <b>15</b>, a video signal processing section <b>16</b>, a distance sensor <b>17</b>, a shape data processing section <b>18</b>, and a system control section <b>11</b> which controls operation of the elements just mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The pattern light projection section <b>12</b> irradiates infrared rays of a pattern necessary for distance measurement toward an imaging object <b>2</b> in accordance with an instruction from the system control section <b>11</b>. For the pattern light, slit light or grid light is used based on a principle of measurement of the distance sensor <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A lens <b>13</b> condenses light from the imaging object <b>2</b> and introduces the light into a prism <b>14</b>. The prism <b>14</b> spectrally separates the incident light from the lens <b>13</b> into visible rays and infrared rays. In particular, since light from the imaging object includes not only visible rays but also reflected light from the imaging object of the infrared rays irradiated from the pattern light projection section <b>12</b> described above, it is spectrally separated into the visible rays and the infrared rays and outputs the visible rays to the imager <b>15</b> and the infrared rays to the distance sensor <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The imager <b>15</b> is formed from a CCD (Charge Coupled Device), a CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) or the like, and extracts color information from the visible rays inputted thereto from the prism <b>14</b> in response to a synchronizing signal, a control signal and so forth from the system control section <b>11</b> and outputs the extracted color information as a video signal to the video signal processing section <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The video signal processing section <b>16</b> performs gain adjustment, color adjustment processing and so forth for the video signal inputted thereto from the imager <b>15</b> in response to a synchronizing signal and a control signal from the system control section <b>11</b>, converts, when necessary, the resulting video signal into an analog signal or a digital signal and outputs the analog or digital signal as a color video signal to a computer <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The distance sensor <b>17</b> receives the infrared rays introduced thereto from the prism <b>14</b>, processes the received infrared rays in response to a synchronizing signal and a control signal from the system control section <b>11</b> into a binary digitized signal, and outputs the resulting signal to the shape data processing section <b>18</b>. It is to be noted that details of the distance sensor <b>17</b> are hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The shape data processing section <b>18</b> determines, in response to a synchronizing signal and a control signal from the system control section <b>11</b>, a timing at which the intensity of the infrared rays exhibits its peak from the binary digitized signal inputted thereto from the distance sensor <b>17</b>, calculates a distance to the imaging object <b>2</b> based on the principle of triangular surveying from the determined intensity, and arithmetically operates a three-dimensional shape of the imaging object <b>2</b>. Then, the shape data processing section <b>18</b> outputs a result of the arithmetic operation as a shape data signal to the computer <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The computer <b>19</b> performs computer graphics processing for the color video signal supplied thereto from the video signal processing section <b>16</b> and the shape data signal supplied thereto from the shape data processing section <b>18</b>. The computer <b>19</b> outputs resulting data to a monitor <b>3</b>, which may be formed from a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube), a LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) or the like, or to an external storage apparatus <b>4</b> so that the data may be stored into the external storage apparatus <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Now, details of the distance sensor <b>17</b> are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Distance sensors are roughly divided into two types, and the distance sensor <b>17</b> may be of any of the two types. In particular, where a first one of the two types is used, pixels <b>41</b> arrayed in a horizontal direction in an optical area <b>31</b> are successively scanned to extract output signals to be processed from the pixels <b>41</b>. On the other hand, where a second one of the two types is used, pixels <b>41</b> arrayed in a vertical direction in an optical area <b>31</b> are successively scanned to extract output signals to be processed from the pixels <b>41</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a construction of the distance sensor <b>17</b> of the former type while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a construction of the distance sensor <b>17</b> of the latter type.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">First, the distance sensor <b>17</b> of the horizontally scanning type is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The optical area <b>31</b> includes a plurality of pixels <b>41</b> having an arithmetic operation function and disposed in a matrix of n&#xd7;m (=quantity in the horizontal direction&#xd7;quantity in the vertical direction). Each of the pixels <b>41</b> arithmetically operates a signal corresponding to an amount of received light in response to a reset pulse signal and a light reception section transfer pulse signal outputted from a timing generator <b>32</b>, and outputs a result of the arithmetic operation in a horizontal direction to an outputting circuit <b>34</b> over a common signal line <b>42</b> based on a selection signal supplied thereto from a horizontal scanning circuit <b>33</b><i>a</i>. It is to be noted that the pixels <b>41</b> are hereinafter described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The timing generator <b>32</b> supplies control pulse signal to the horizontal scanning circuit <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the outputting circuit <b>34</b> and generates and outputs an amplification section drive pulse signal, a reset pulse signal and a light reception section transfer pulse signal to the pixels <b>41</b> of the optical area <b>31</b> in accordance with a control signal from the system control section <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The horizontal scanning circuit <b>33</b><i>a </i>generates and supplies a clear pulse signal, a storage section transfer pulse signal, a comparison section drive pulse signal and a selection signal to the pixels <b>41</b> of the optical area <b>31</b> in accordance with a control pulse signal supplied thereto from the timing generator <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The outputting circuit <b>34</b> successively receives output signals of the pixels <b>41</b> of the optical area <b>31</b> over the common signal lines <b>42</b> in synchronism with a control pulse signal from the timing generator <b>32</b> and outputs the received output signals to the shape data processing section <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An arithmetic operation control section <b>35</b> supplies an arithmetic operation selection signal for selecting (designating) an arithmetic operation process to be executed by a matrix circuit <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of a storage section <b>61</b> of an arithmetic operation section <b>53</b> of each of the pixels <b>41</b> in accordance with a control signal from the system control section <b>11</b>. It is to be noted that the matrix circuit <b>72</b> of the storage section <b>61</b> of the arithmetic operation section <b>53</b> is hereinafter described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">On the other hand, in the distance sensor <b>17</b> of the vertical scanning type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a vertical scanning circuit <b>33</b><i>b </i>is provided in place of the horizontal scanning circuit <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the distance sensor <b>17</b> of the horizontal scanning type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and outputs of the pixels <b>41</b> driven by the vertical scanning circuit <b>33</b><i>b </i>are successively supplied in a vertical direction to the outputting circuit <b>34</b> over the common signal lines <b>42</b>. The other construction of the distance sensor <b>17</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is similar to that of the distance sensor <b>17</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Now, details of the pixels <b>41</b> are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, n pixels <b>41</b><i>a </i>to <b>41</b><i>n </i>connected to one of the common signal lines <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are shown. Here, while a construction only of the pixel <b>41</b><i>a </i>is shown, also the other pixels <b>41</b><i>b </i>to <b>41</b><i>n </i>have a similar construction.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, like elements to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are denoted by like reference characters and overlapping description of them is suitably omitted herein to avoid redundancy. In the distance sensor <b>17</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, pixel output lines <b>101</b> and a storage arithmetic operation area <b>102</b> are provided newly. Pixel signals from the pixels <b>41</b> in the optical area <b>31</b> are outputted to the corresponding storage sections <b>61</b> in the storage arithmetic operation area <b>102</b> over the corresponding pixel output lines <b>101</b>. Each of the pixels <b>41</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> includes the light reception section <b>51</b> and the amplification section <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and elements serving as the arithmetic operation section <b>53</b> and the outputting section <b>54</b> following the light reception section <b>51</b> and the amplification section <b>52</b>, respectively, are provided in the storage section <b>61</b> corresponding to the pixel <b>41</b> of the storage operation area <b>102</b>. The arithmetic operation section <b>53</b> and the outputting section <b>54</b> are connected to a corresponding one of the pixel output lines <b>101</b>. Where the arithmetic operation sections and the outputting sections of the pixels <b>41</b> are provided separately in this manner, the pixels <b>41</b> can be arranged efficiently in the optical area <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a timing chart illustrating processing of a plurality of pixels <b>41</b> of the optical area <b>31</b> and the storage arithmetic operation area <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In particular, for example, with regard to the pixel i&#x2212;1, the storage section <b>61</b> of the storage arithmetic operation area <b>102</b> stores, at the sampling timings k and k+1 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a signal inputted thereto in synchronism with a transfer pulse signal from the light reception section <b>51</b> through the amplification section <b>52</b> and over the pixel output line <b>101</b> into a storage cell (one of the storage cells <b>71</b><i>a </i>to <b>71</b><i>d </i>in which data of the oldest timing is stored) from which data has been erased in synchronism with a clear pulse signal. Then, the light reception section <b>51</b> corresponding to the storage section <b>61</b> is reset by a reset pulse signal and starts light reception newly. On the other hand, the signals stored in the storage cells <b>71</b><i>a </i>to <b>71</b><i>d </i>are arithmetically operated in response to an arithmetic operation selection signal inputted from the arithmetic operation control section <b>35</b>, and a result of the arithmetic operation is outputted to the outputting section <b>54</b>. Then, the outputting section <b>54</b> outputs the received signal to the outputting circuit <b>34</b> over the common signal line <b>42</b> in synchronism with a selection signal from the horizontal scanning circuit <b>33</b><i>a</i>. Thereafter, the next pixel i executes the processing illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> at the sampling timings k and k+1 same as those for the pixel i&#x2212;1. It is to be noted that, while the distance sensor <b>17</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is of the horizontal scanning type same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it may have a construction otherwise of the vertical scanning type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">While, in the foregoing description, the image processing apparatus executes three-dimensional image processing, it may execute some other processing which requires arithmetic operation processing together with image processing. For example, the image processing apparatus may be applied also to a thermography apparatus which measures a temperature distribution together with image information, or may be applied to a three-dimensional thermography apparatus by combining the three-dimensional image processing described above and the thermography apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Where each of the pixels <b>41</b> has an arithmetic operation function as described above, image processing on the real-time basis is allowed.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A package for one or more solid state devices in a single module that allows for operation at high voltage, high current, or both high voltage and high current. Low thermal resistance between the solid state devices and an exterior of the package and matched coefficient of thermal expansion between the solid state devices and the materials used in packaging enables high power operation. The solid state devices are soldered between two layers of ceramic with metal traces that interconnect the devices and external contacts. This approach provides a simple method for assembling and encapsulating high power solid state devices.</p>

More particularly, the invention pertains to packaging high power solid state devices used to control high voltage, high current, or both high voltage and high current, in areas such as pulsed power for electromagnets, lasers, ion sources, X-ray sources, and other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Packaging of high power solid state devices, such as diodes, transistors, and thyristors, has to encompass the interconnection of the devices and external contacts, heat dissipation for up to hundreds of watts of heat, and electrical insulation for up to thousands of volts. Typically, these packages include a base, such as a ceramic substrate, solid state devices, wires and other metal contacts connected to the base and the solid state devices, a shell, and encapsulant. Several steps are necessary to assemble these packages. The solid state device and required metal contacts are soldered to the base. The wires are soldered to the base and to the solid state device. The assembly of the base, solid state device, wires, and metal contacts, is placed in a shell. The shell is filled with an encapsulant. An example can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 6,597,585, which describes a method using a plastic housing and a ceramic substrate. Another example of such packaging methods can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 6,597,063, describing a packaging method with an integrated heat sink.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This method of packaging is easy for single device modules or simple solid state devices. As the number of interconnections increases, the assembly of the package becomes more difficult. Examples of the increases in complexity include connecting to the gate of a thyristor, or with multiple devices, the interconnection of devices in parallel or in series. An invention describing a packaging method for these more complicated systems can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 6,566,750, although this packaging method is for a non-insulated power semiconductor module. Another example can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 6,627,987, in which a packaging method using pockets in a ceramic substrate is described.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. Application No. 20030205804 describes the manufacture of such packages using a ceramic base and a thin-film circuit layer for the interconnections. This method replaces the wires and other metal contacts used for interconnections with a thin-film circuit layer, significantly reducing problems associated with assembling wires and other metal contacts in these packages. The advances in creating thin-film circuit layers using deposition and lithography techniques developed for semiconductor manufacturing allow this procedure to easily interconnect complex packages of solid state devices. However, such methods increase the cost in time and material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Whatever method is used to package high power solid state devices, it is important to consider electrical insulation, impedance, and inductance. The package has to insulate above the maximum operating voltage to prevent breakdown and shorting, resulting in damage to the package. Selecting appropriate insulating material is important. Also, the impedance of the electrical connections internal and external to the package must be kept as low as possible to prevent power loss and additional heating in those connections. Power loss reduces efficiency while heating can cause localized stress. Lastly, the inductance of the interconnections must also be kept as low as possible to prevent large induced voltages in the electrical connections. These large induced voltages occur during rapid changes in current conduction versus time and can cause solid state devices to improperly change state, from conducting to non-conducting or from non-conducting to conducting. High interconnection inductance increases the trigger system requirements and limits applications for the devices. Therefore, properly designed packages maximize electrical insulation while minimizing the electrical impedance and inductance of the electrical connections.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another important issue for packaging solid state devices is to prevent the exposure of the solid state devices to an oxidizing environment, both during the packaging and in use. To prevent oxidation during packaging, the packaging environment is controlled by using vacuum or inert gas atmosphere. These conditions prevent oxidizing agents such as oxygen and water from affecting components during the packaging. To prevent oxidation after packaging, the packaging materials are selected to prevent the oxidizing agents from migrating to the components inside the package. For example, hardened encapsulants can act as a hermetic seal, significantly slowing the migration of oxygen and water to the components internal to the package. By reducing the exposure of the internal components to oxidizing agents, the lifetime of the components is greatly extended.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention is a method of packaging solid state devices capable of high current conduction, high operating voltage, or both high current conduction and high operating voltage. The method of packaging allows for electrical insulation for high voltages, dissipation of large quantities of heat, structural rigidity, long life-time reliability, low cost for manufacturing, and compactness. This method of packaging will allow for more economical assembly of complicated solid state systems. The packaging enables low inductance internal and external connections to enable operation at high rates of current rise versus time.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This method can be used to package diodes, metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), Bipolar Transistors (BJT), Gate Turn-Off (GTO) thyristors, Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT), and other solid state devices, used to control high voltage, high current, or both high voltage and high current, in areas such as pulsed power for electromagnets, lasers, ion sources, X-ray sources, and other applications. This method is appropriate for packaging the compact high voltage solid state switch described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,624,684.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This invention uses two layers of ceramic substrate, two encapsulants, metal threaded and pin terminals, and metal strip-lines, to package high power solid state devices. The ceramic substrates provide electrical insulation for high voltage and are matched to the coefficient of thermal expansion of the solid state devices. The ceramic substrates have metal pads bonded on both surfaces for mounting the solid state devices and to provide low impedance and low inductance interconnections with separate current paths for control and high current signals. The first encapsulant is matched to the coefficient of thermal expansion of the solid state devices, while both encapsulants provide electrical insulation for high voltage. The ceramic substrates, the solid state devices, the threaded terminals, and the metal strip-lines, are soldered together into one assembly. This assembly is then encapsulated with the first encapsulant into one unit. This unit is encapsulated by the second encapsulant into the final module.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">One example of the method of packaging of solid state devices of this invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It comprises one or more solid state devices <b>65</b>, two layers of metallized ceramic substrate <b>13</b>, <b>41</b>, two encapsulants <b>6</b>, <b>9</b>, metal threaded <b>3</b> and pin terminals <b>2</b>, and metal strip-lines <b>83</b>. Ceramic substrates <b>13</b>, <b>41</b> are used because of ceramic's excellent electrical insulating properties, high thermal conductivity and low thermal coefficient of expansion. The encapsulants <b>6</b>, <b>9</b> provide further electrical insulation over the rest of the package while also preventing exposure of the components to oxidizing agents and providing structural rigidity and durability. Metal threaded <b>3</b> and pin terminals <b>2</b> are used to provide low power electrical connections to external circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The strip-line <b>83</b> can also be seen in the sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The strip-line consists of conductive strips <b>4</b>, <b>8</b> separated by an insulator <b>5</b> with a high dielectric strength, such as Kapton, and are used to provide low inductance and low impedance high power electrical connections. Other electrical connections, such as the wire jumper <b>82</b> and the metal strip <b>80</b> are used as needed to connect the two layers of metallized ceramic substrate <b>13</b>, <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One metallized ceramic substrate <b>13</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, will normally be in contact with a heat sink. The ceramic <b>11</b> should have a low thermal resistance and a coefficient of thermal expansion close to that of the solid state devices <b>65</b>. Aluminum Nitride is typically used with silicon devices. On one side of this ceramic <b>11</b> a metal pad <b>20</b> nearly the size of the ceramic is bonded to the ceramic <b>11</b>. This pad <b>20</b> is normally placed in contact with a heat sink to allow for the dissipation of heat generated by the high power solid state devices <b>65</b>. Bonded to the other side of the ceramic <b>11</b> are a number of metal pads <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, equivalent to the number of solid state devices <b>65</b> in the package. These pads are larger than the solid state device associated with the specific pad. Direct bond copper, with a nickel coating and a gold flash, is one means used to provide the metal pads <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>20</b>. Active metal braze and other techniques can be used. The thickness of the ceramic <b>11</b> must be sufficient to withstand the potential difference between the pads <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> associated with the solid state devices <b>65</b> and the potential of the pad <b>20</b> in contact with the heat sink. By placing a selected bias potential on this pad <b>20</b>, the electric field across the ceramic <b>11</b> can be reduced, improving the lifetime of this component. The distance between pads <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> associated with the solid state devices <b>65</b> must be sufficient to prevent breakdown between the solid state devices <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The second metallized ceramic substrate <b>41</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. This piece of ceramic <b>31</b> should have a coefficient of thermal expansion close to that of the solid state devices <b>65</b>. Since there is less need for low thermal resistance and to reduce cost, this piece of ceramic <b>31</b> is typically Aluminum Oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Bonded to one side of this ceramic substrate <b>31</b> are a series of pads <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> which are designed to connect to specific points <b>61</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> on specific solid state devices <b>65</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Bonded to the other side of this ceramic substrate <b>31</b> are pads <b>32</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>40</b> that provide interconnections between solid state devices <b>65</b> and external contacts <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>. Again, direct bond copper, with a nickel coating and a gold flash, can be used to provide the metal pad.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">There are metal filled vias <b>33</b> through the ceramic substrate connecting the pads on one side to pads on the other. Additionally, there are holes <b>30</b> through this ceramic <b>31</b> located near opposite edges to provide for aligning parts during assembly. Other holes <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> through this ceramic <b>31</b> or additional pads <b>35</b>, <b>50</b> bonded to this ceramic substrate <b>31</b> may be used depending on the type of solid state device and the requirements for assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For both pieces of ceramic, the number, shape, and location, for all of the pads, vias, and holes, are established to provide low impedance and low inductance interconnections and to separate control signal current paths from high current paths. The latter is particularly important for switching applications that result in a high rate of current rise versus time.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Packaging of the high power solid state devices <b>65</b> starts by assembling the solid state devices <b>65</b>, the ceramic substrates <b>13</b>, <b>41</b>, the metal threaded and pin terminals <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and the metal strip-lines <b>83</b>. This can be done using an automated placement device. The solid state devices <b>65</b> are placed between the-two ceramic substrates <b>13</b>, <b>41</b>, matching the pads <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> on the ceramic substrate <b>41</b> to metallic contacts <b>61</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> on the solid state devices <b>65</b>. Between each contact and pad is placed a layer of solder. The entire assembly is run through an; environmentally controlled solder re-flow oven. This bonds the components together while preventing oxide layers from forming. The temperatures and environments are controlled to reduce stress on the assembly before, during, and after the parts are bonded together. This assembly is then cleaned to remove flux and other debris.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, the assembly is encapsulated. On one side of the assembly is the first ceramic substrate <b>13</b> with the large pad <b>20</b> facing out from the assembly. The large pad <b>20</b> is placed against one part of a mold using a removable adhesive sealant such as Room Temperature Vulcanizing (RTV). The structure is then sealed against the second part of the mold. The assembled mold is vacuum filled with the first encapsulant <b>9</b>, such as a one component epoxy resin, from the first ceramic substrate <b>13</b> to above the second ceramic substrate <b>41</b>. The vacuum fill is important to remove the air prior to the introduction of the encapsulant <b>9</b> so as to reduce the probability of air bubbles trapped inside the encapsulant <b>9</b>. The encapsulant <b>9</b> typically has a high dielectric strength but its electrical insulation capability is greatly reduced by the presence of air bubbles in the hardened encapsulant <b>9</b>. The RTV sealant is important to prevent the encapsulant <b>9</b> from seeping over the surface of the side of ceramic substrate <b>13</b>. The encapsulant <b>9</b> needs to have similar coefficient of thermal expansion as the solid state device <b>65</b> and the ceramic substrates <b>13</b>, <b>41</b>. It is also useful for this encapsulant <b>80</b> to have low thermal resistance. An example of such an encapsulant would be Dexter Hysol CB064. This encapsulates the solid state devices <b>65</b> between the ceramic substrates <b>13</b>, <b>41</b>, producing a volume with all parts having similar coefficients of thermal expansion and low thermal resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The original second part of the mold is removed and the encapsulated unit, still sealed on one part of the mold, is sealed against a different second part of the mold. This assembled mold is now vacuum filled with a second encapsulant <b>6</b>. This encapsulant <b>6</b> must be rigid and insulate for high voltage. It will provide the exterior surface of the package <b>7</b>. The second encapsulant <b>6</b> can have a higher coefficient of thermal expansion and higher thermal resistance and is typically easier to work with and substantially less costly than the first encapsulant <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The encapsulation of the package can be done in one step using a single encapsulant for both <b>6</b>, <b>9</b> with a low thermal resistance and a coefficient of thermal expansion similar to the solid state devices <b>65</b>. This may be more economical if the total volume to be encapsulated is small.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The module <b>7</b> is then removed from the mold. The high power solid state devices <b>65</b> are now packaged in a way that provides structural rigidity, long-lifetime, low thermal resistance, is compact, insulates for high voltage, and is low cost for manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Alternatively, as mentioned above in the discussion of the prior art, instead of pouring a second encapsulant with a second mold step, the exterior of the package can instead be formed by a solid piece, called a shell, which could also act as part of the mold for the pour of the first encapsulant. The shell can also be filled with the second encapsulant. This would provide the same effect of increased electrical insulation and rigidity as the second mold step, above.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An example of an assembled package <b>7</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This package <b>7</b> is a high voltage and high current switch designed to operate at a peak current of 6000 amperes and a maximum stand-off voltage of 8000 volts. The solid state devices <b>65</b> in this switch are silicon <b>60</b> based thyristors with a ceramic lid <b>62</b>, which has two cathode <b>61</b>, <b>63</b> and one gate <b>64</b> metal contacts. By using ceramic <b>11</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>62</b> and encapsulant <b>80</b> with similar coefficients of thermal expansion to the silicon <b>60</b>, there is less stress on the components during thermal cycling. In this case, the ceramic <b>11</b> of the first ceramic substrate <b>13</b> is aluminum nitride and the ceramic <b>31</b> of the second ceramic substrate <b>41</b> is aluminum oxide. The designs of the ceramic substrates <b>13</b>, <b>41</b> assure electrical insulation for voltages higher than the maximum stand-off voltage of the switches. Two sets of pin terminals <b>2</b> on the cap ceramic provide the gate and gate return electrical connections from the two thyristors <b>65</b> to an external circuit. Separating the gate return connection from cathode connection reduces even further the effects of high induced voltages on the solid state device <b>65</b>. The three threaded terminals <b>3</b> provide electrical connections from the anode and cathode potentials for the two thyristors <b>65</b> to an external circuit. As the thyristors <b>65</b> are in series, the anode of one of the thyristors <b>65</b> is at the same potential as the cathode of the other thyristor <b>65</b>. These terminals <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are easily connected to the self powered trigger circuit as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,624,684. The package <b>7</b> mounts to a standard heat sink <b>71</b> using four through holes <b>1</b> at the corners of the package <b>7</b>. To add rigidity to those mounting holes, fiberglass inserts <b>81</b> are used.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, this example switch package <b>7</b> can be used by clamping a mating strip-line <b>70</b> to the external strip-line <b>4</b> of the package <b>7</b>. The package <b>7</b> is mounted to a heat sink <b>71</b>, making sure to properly join the heat sink <b>71</b> to the pad <b>20</b> on the bottom of the first ceramic substrate <b>13</b>, if necessary with a thermal joint compound. The heat sink <b>71</b> is then biased at a potential equivalent to the anode potential of either one of the two thyristors <b>65</b> to minimize the peak electric field in the ceramic substrate. The external trigger circuit then mounts on to the terminals. The example switch is now ready for high power operation.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is related to Huffman decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As is well-known, Huffman coding is a popular variable length statistical encoding scheme. As is also well-known, Huffman code generation relies on statistical probabilities for each individual symbol. See, for example, D. A. Huffman, &#x201c;A Method for the Reconstruction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes&#x201d; Proceedings of the IRE, Volume 40, No. 9, pages 1098-1101, 1952. A traditional table lookup based encoding scheme is widely used for Huffman encoding due, at least in part, to its efficiency and relative ease of implementation. However, table searching based decoding is typically inefficient in both software and hardware implementations. This is especially the case when the number of entries in a table is reasonably high, as is typical for practical applications. Another approach employed for Huffman decoding is the creation of a Huffman tree which employs a &#x201c;tree traversing technique.&#x201d; However, this decoding technique also has disadvantages. This particular technique is bit sequential, and introduces extra &#x201c;overhead&#x201d; both in terms of memory allocation and the execution of computations for the Huffman tree generation process and for the decoding process.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As previously indicated, generation of Huffman codes for a set of symbols is based on the probability of occurrence of the source symbols. Typically, the construction of a binary tree referred to in this context as a Huffman tree is employed D. A. Huffman, in the aforementioned paper, describes the process with their way:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">List all possible symbols with their probabilities;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">Find the two symbols with the smallest probabilities;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">Replace these by a single set containing both symbols, whose probability is the sum of the individual probabilities;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0018">Repeat until the list contains only one member.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">This procedure produces a recursively structured set of sets, each of which contains exactly two members. It, therefore, may be represented as a binary tree (&#x201c;Huffman Tree&#x201d;) with the symbols as the &#x201c;leaves.&#x201d; Then to form the code (&#x201c;Huffman Code&#x201d;) for any particular symbol: traverse the binary tree from the root to that symbol, recording &#x201c;0&#x201d; for a left branch and &#x201c;1&#x201d; for a right branch. One issue, however, for this procedure is that the resultant Huffman tree is not unique. One example of an application of such codes is text compression, such as GZIP. GZIP is a text compression utility, developed under the GNU (Gnu's Not Unix) project, a project with a goal of developing a &#x201c;free&#x201d; or freely available UNIX-like operation system, for replacing the &#x201c;compress&#x201d; text compression utility on a UNIX operation system. See, for example, Galley, J. L. and Adler, M., GZIP documentation and sources, available as gzip-1.2.4. tar at the website &#x201c;http://www.gzip.org/&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">As is well-known, the resulting Huffman codes are prefix codes and the more frequently appearing symbols are assigned a smaller number of bits to form the variable length Huffman code. As a result, the average code length is ultimately reduced from taking advantage of the frequency of occurrence of the symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a simple example of a Huffman tree with three source symbols. The same Huffman tree may be represented using several binary codes by assigning different binary symbols to the edges of the tree.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022">The possible set of Huffman codes for this Huffman tree is illustrated in FIG. <b>2</b>. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is demonstrated that Huffman codes are not unique although, it appears from this example, that the individual code length of each symbol is unique.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">One may generate the length information for the Huffman codes by constructing the corresponding Huffman tree. However, as previously indicated, Huffman codes may not be unique when generated in this fashion. Nonetheless, it may be shown that by imposing two restrictions, the Huffman code produced by employing the Huffman tree may be assured of being unique. These restrictions are:</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">1. All codes of a given bit length have lexicographically consecutive values, in the same order as the symbols they represent; and</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">2. Shorter codes lexicographically precede longer codes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">Based on these restrictions, a Huffman code may be uniquely determined. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for example, shows a Huffman code set of 19 symbols employing these restrictions, where the code lengths are predetermined using the Huffman tree. For the table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a dash in an entry in the Huffman code table shows that the code by the symbol and the current source alphabet does not exist and its length information is zero.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">Although the invention is not limited in scope in this respect, the foregoing restrictions have been employed in various compression approaches and standards, such as in the previously described utility, GZIP, for example. Typically, in such applications, the Huffman tree information is passed in terms of a set of code length information along with compressed text data. Therefore, the set of code length information is sufficient to reconstruct a unique Huffman tree. The Huffman code table illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for example, may be generated using the following process, as implemented in GZIP.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028">The code lengths are initially in Length[l];</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">1) Count the number of codes for each code length. Let &#x201c;count[N]&#x201d; be the number of codes of length N, N&#x3e;=1.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">2) Find the numerical value of the smallest code for each code length:</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0032">3) Assign numerical values to all codes, using consecutive values determined in 2.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">As previously indicated, Huffman encoding may be accomplished relatively easily using a table lookup technique. However, the decoding of Huffman codes is typically more computationally intensive because when code words are received in a compressed bit stream to be decoded, there are no predefined boundaries between the code words. Huffman codes are variable length codes, as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">One approach or technique, referred to as a constant input rate decoder, processes the input bit stream serially, one bit at a time. This method employs the construction of a decoding or Huffman tree. Therefore, starting from the root, the technique involves traversing the branches of the decoding tree until a terminal node is reached. At the terminal node, the code word is fully decoded and the corresponding symbol may, therefore, be produced or output as desired. This process then begins again from the root of the tree. See, for example, &#x201c;Image and Video Compressions Standards: Algorithms and Architectures&#x201d;, by B. Bhaskarin and K. Konstantinides, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1995.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an example of a Huffman encoding table with the corresponding decoding tree. One problem associated with such a decoder in hardware or software is how to efficiently map the decoding tree into memory. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a table of read only memory (ROM) entries for bit serial Huffman decoding using the decoding tree of FIG. <b>4</b>. One approach to efficiently mapping memory was proposed for example, by Mukherjee et al., &#x201c;MARVLE: a VLSI chip for data compression using tree-based codes,&#x201d; IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) System, 1(2):203-214, June 1993.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">Another approach, although not particularly efficient, for decoding the Huffman code, is to compare each entry of the Huffman table with input bits in the input buffer. Under this approach, at worst, N entries in the encoding table will be compared, where N is the total number of symbols. In addition, the code length information for the entry is to be known.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">In an embodiment of a method of decoding a series of binary digital signals using a data structure, the following approach may be employed. The data structure may be searched based on, at least in part, the length of a subgrouping of binary digital signals being decoded. In this particular embodiment, the series binary digital signals are encoded, such as Huffman encoded, although the invention is not restricted in scope to Huffman coding or decoding. In this particular embodiment, although the invention is not restricted in scope in this respect, prior to searching, the first N binary digital signals in the series are selected as a subgrouping, where N is the length of the shortest code. Furthermore, the length of the subgrouping is increased by the next binary digital signal in the series if no code in the data structure having length N matches the subgrouping. Likewise, in this particular embodiment, where this approach is employed, every code in the data structure having the same length as the subgrouping is checked for a match. It is noted, as shall be described in more detail hereinafter, the data structure is organized, at least in part, based on code length. Furthermore, the data structure is organized so the codes having the same code length are stored sequentially.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">Although the invention is not restricted in scope to this particular embodiment of a data structure, this particular embodiment may be related to the Huffman code table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, after rearranging some symbols to show redundancy in a table. This is illustrated, for example, in FIG. <b>6</b>. For example, the symbols with Huffman code length zero means these symbols are not employed. Likewise, based on the first of the previous restrictions, all codes of a given bit length will have lexicographically consecutive values. Thus, by tracking the length information, the Huffman code of the first symbol in lexicographical order having a Huffman code of this length, and the number of Huffman codes to the last symbol with the same length, provides the information shown with less to potentially no information redundancy.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">This particular embodiment of a data structure is shown in FIG. <b>7</b>. It may be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> carries the same information as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, but is rearranged for simplicity and ease of use. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> employs less memory and, as shall be described in more detail hereinafter, allows a bit parallel decoding scheme to be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">With the embodiment of a data structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, decoding of the Huffman codes may be performed in a bit parallel approach based, at least in part, on the information of code length and the range of Huffman codes for each code length, as shown in the embodiment of FIG. <b>7</b>. This is illustrated and described below using a pseudo-code implementation, although, again, the invention is not limited in scope to the particular pseudo-code provided.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">The composite data structure is referred to in this context as NDS (NDC). This corresponds with the definition of a composite data structure for programming language C, although the invention is not limited in scope to this programming language or to any particular programming language. In this particular embodiment, although, again, the invention is not limited in scope in this respect, each entry of NDS comprises four fields, designated length, start code, end code and base index, respectively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in this particular embodiment. It is, of course, appreciated that many equivalent data structures are possible, such as, instead of a start code and end code, employing a start code and the difference between the start code and end code.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">In this particular embodiment, however, NDC is the number of entries with a distinct code length. Each entry represents a group of consecutive Huffman codes with the same code length. Start code is the first Huffman code of this group and end code is the last Huffman code of this group. Base index is the index value of the first Huffman code in the Huffman table for the corresponding symbol, as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>. As has previously been indicated, it is noted that the invention is not restricted in scope to this particular data structure. Clearly, many modifications to this particular data structure may be made and still remain within the spirit and scope of what has been described.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">Employing the embodiment of a data structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the following is a pseudo code representation of an embodiment in accordance with the present invention for decoding a series of binary digital signals.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0045">In this particular embodiment, although the invention is not limited in scope in this respect, prior to searching the data structure, the first N binary digital signals in a series are selected as a subgrouping, where N is the length of the shortest code. All the codes having that length are then checked for a match. If no match occurs, then the length of the subgrouping is increased by the next binary digital signal in the series and then the codes having the increased length are checked for a match. This process is continued until a match occurs. As previously noted, the data structure is organized, at least in part, based on code length and the data structure is organized so that codes having the same code length are stored lexicographically sequentially. This allows for efficient operation, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">It is noted that in an alternative embodiment may be possible to begin searching with the longest code and decrease the length of the subgrouping when no match occurs. However, typically, a shorter Huffman code has a higher probability of occurrence, making it is more efficient in such situations to start searching form the shortest code.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">This particular embodiment of a method of decoding a series of binary digital signals has several advantages in terms of memory utilization, computational complexity and implementation. As previously suggested, the number of entries for the data structure depends on the maximum code length for the Huffman code, not the number of symbols. Therefore, this results in a reduction of memory. For example, with an application with a fixed limit code length, such as GZIP, a typical Huffman tree has 285 symbols and the code length is limited to 15 bits. In contrast, the number of entries employed for this embodiment will have at most 15 entries, depending on the data, resulting, in this example in a 19 * times reduction in memory utilization.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">Likewise, computational complexity is reduced by using a bit parallel search process, rather than a bit serial search process. Here, this embodiment is based, at least in part, on the code length information in the data structure. The search procedure improves over existing approaches by checking the range of the start and end codes for the group having that code length. Experimental results with this embodiment, which employ 19 symbols and a maximum code lengths of 7 bits, provide a 5.5 times reduction in complexity, compared with decoding in which a search of Huffman code table is employed. Likewise, because no binary tree construction takes place, as occurs where a Huffman tree is constructed, and with little or no dynamic memory allocation, implementation of decoding in accordance with the present invention is relatively easy in both hardware and software.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">It will, of course, be understood that, although particular embodiments have just been described, the invention is not limited in scope to a particular embodiment or implementation. For example, one embodiment may be in hardware, whereas another embodiment may be in software. Likewise, an embodiment may be in firmware, or any combination of hardware, software, or firmware, for example. Likewise, although the invention is not limited in scope in this respect, one embodiment may comprise an article, such as a storage medium. Such a storage medium, such as, for example, a CD-ROM, or a disk, may have stored thereon instructions, which when executed by a system, such as a computer system or platform, or an imaging system, may result in an embodiment of a method in accordance with the present invention being executed, such as a method of performing Huffman decoding, for example, as previously described. Likewise, embodiments of a method of creating a data structure, in accordance with the present invention, may be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">While certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A light-emitting element drive apparatus for achieving light-emission control of a light-emitting element with high speed and high accuracy includes a monitoring photodiode <b>11</b> that receives light emitted from a laser diode <b>12</b> to generate a current, Im, that corresponds to the optical output thereof. The current Im is converted to a monitor voltage Vm by a current-to-voltage conversion circuit <b>13</b>, and its waveform is smoothed by a first low-pass filter <b>14</b> to produce a monitoring average value Vav that has a ripple component. A pre-modulated optical power setup voltage Vps generated by a variable direct-current voltage source <b>25</b> is modulated by a pulse modulation circuit <b>22</b> based on a data signal delayed by a predetermined time, and smoothed via a second low-pass filter <b>23</b> and a third low-pass filter <b>24</b>. Then, an optical power setup voltage Vref that has a nearly similar amplitude and ripple component is generated in synchronization with the average value Vav.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to light-emitting element drive apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Optical modulation of a digital signal by a laser diode conventionally uses a direct modulation scheme where modulation is performed by on/off of a drive current.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an optical output pf vs. forward current If of a laser diode. The optical output pf increases nearly in proportion to the current after the threshold current Ith where light emission starts. The optical output characteristics are strongly dependent upon temperature. Generally, to keep the optical output pf constant, more forward current If is required at higher temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also shows a difference in the optical output waveform depending upon temperature, where the forward current If is kept constant during direct modulation. Curve A denotes an optical output vs. forward current characteristic curve for a laser diode at low temperature. Curve B represents an optical output vs. forward current characteristic curve for a laser diode at high temperature. As shown, if the forward current If is kept constant (=I<b>1</b>), there are significant deviations between the optical output pf at low temperature (=P<b>1</b>) and the optical output pf at high temperature (=P<b>2</b>). In addition to temperature-dependent variations in characteristics, decreases in the optical output pf due to degradation over time (aging) also raise a problem. Generally, in order to compensate for the afore-described temperature-dependent changes and variations in the optical output pf due to degradation over time and thereby achieve a constant optical output pf, the forward current If of the laser diode is typically controlled by an automatic power control (APC) circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The optical output pf of the laser diode may be monitored by a current output of a monitoring photodiode (MPD) bundled with a laser diode module. More specifically, the monitoring photodiode outputs a current (monitor current Im) that is proportional to the optical input from the laser diode, and is also less dependent upon temperature. Thus, based on the monitor current Im of the monitoring photodiode, the forward current If of the laser diode is feedback controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, as methods for detecting the monitor current Im, peak detection and average-value detection are mainly available. The monitor current Im is converted to a voltage value Vm by a resistive load before it is detected. Then, peak detection is performed by monitoring high levels of the voltage waveform. Thus, with peak detection, its detection accuracy is substantially affected by the waveform quality of the voltage value Vm. In other words, peak detection requires a high-speed sample-and-hold circuit as the transmission rate increases. Additionally, the waveform of the voltage Vm is muted by influences of the terminal capacitance of the monitoring photodiode and the input terminal capacitance of the laser diode drive circuit. Accordingly, peak detection seems impracticable for detection with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, average-value detection smoothes the waveform of the voltage Vm, which is handled as an average value, so that it is easy to operate. As a result, as a method for detecting the monitor current Im, average-value detection is mainly used.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows one example of an automatic power control (APC) circuit <b>50</b> that uses a prior art average-value detection scheme. A monitoring photodiode <b>51</b> receives light of a laser diode <b>52</b> and outputs a monitor current Im that corresponds to the received optical output pf. The monitor current Im of the monitoring photodiode <b>51</b> is output to a current-to-voltage conversion circuit <b>53</b>. The current-to-voltage conversion circuit <b>53</b> converts it to a voltage value Vm that corresponds to the current value of the monitor current Im, and the resulting voltage value Vm is output to a low-pass filter (LPF) <b>54</b>. The low-pass filter <b>54</b> smoothes the voltage value Vm. The low-pass filter <b>54</b> then outputs the smoothed voltage value Vm to a comparison circuit <b>55</b> as a monitoring photodiode average-value signal Vav (hereinafter referred to simply as &#x201c;monitoring average value&#x201d;). The comparison circuit <b>55</b>, which includes a comparator, operational amplifier, and so forth, inputs said monitoring average value Vav, as well as a pre-set optical power setup voltage Vref. The comparison circuit <b>55</b> compares the monitoring average value Vav and optical power setup voltage Vref, and outputs the comparison result to a laser diode current control circuit <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The laser diode current control circuit <b>56</b> (hereinafter referred to simply as &#x201c;current control circuit&#x201d;) inputs the comparison result, and controls a bias current drive circuit <b>57</b> and a modulation current drive circuit <b>58</b> based on the comparison result, thereby increasing or decreasing the bias current Ib or modulation current Ip, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The bias current drive circuit <b>57</b> controls the current amount (level value) of the bias current Ib of the laser diode <b>52</b> in accordance with the control signal from the current control circuit <b>56</b> that is based on the comparison result. The modulation current drive circuit <b>58</b> inputs the data signal D, and outputs the modulation current Ip to the laser diode <b>52</b> in response to the data signal D. The modulation current drive circuit <b>58</b> controls the current amount (level value) of the modulation current Ip in accordance with the control signal from the current control circuit <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other words, the laser diode <b>52</b> is feedback-controlled so that optimum optical output pf is achieved. Furthermore, if the laser diode <b>52</b> degrades over time so that it is out of compensation range for the optical output pf at the APC circuit <b>50</b>, an optical degradation alarm is typically generated. Thus, the APC circuit <b>50</b> includes a second comparison circuit <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second comparison circuit <b>59</b> inputs the monitoring average value Vav, as well as a pre-set optical power degradation setup voltage Vd. The second comparison circuit <b>59</b> compares the monitoring average value Vav and optical power degradation setup voltage Vd. Then, if the monitoring average value Vav falls below the optical power degradation setup voltage Vd, the second comparison circuit <b>59</b> outputs a drive signal for driving an alarm device, which is not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With the prior art APC circuit <b>50</b>, because it is set up with a direct-current value, a ripple component in the monitoring average value Vav is related directly to an error relative to the setup value that sets up the optical output pf of the laser diode <b>52</b>. Thus, in order to minimize the ripple component of the monitoring average value Vav, the time constant of the low-pass filter <b>54</b> used for smoothing is set at relatively large values. However, if the time constant of the low-pass filter <b>54</b> is set at relatively large values, although its convergence accuracy would be high, the convergence time until the desired optical output Pos is attained becomes longer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, because the average value is handled, it is presumed that the signal input is always available and that the probability (mark rate) of &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d; for the data signal D is assured to be &#xbd;. That is, the prior art method might be said to be suitable for continuous data where high convergence accuracy is more important than high speed of convergence time, such as SDH/SONET (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy/Synchronous Optical Network).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the other hand, for a burst-type signal, which is typically represented by an upstream signal of ATM-PON (Asynchronous Transfer Mode&#x2014;Passive Optical Network), convergence of the APC circuit is required at extremely short time. With ATM-PON recommended by ITU-TG983.1, a single burst cell is within about 2.4 &#x3bc;sec.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if automatic power control is performed while the time constant of the low-pass filter <b>54</b> remains long as in the prior art, the monitoring average value Vav could not converge to an average-value level that should be reached within a single burst cell. Thus, it is difficult to achieve convergence of automatic power control within a single burst cell.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to accommodate a burst signal, it is necessary to reduce the convergence time of automatic power control. Accordingly, if the time constant of the low-pass filter <b>54</b> is reduced, the monitoring average value Vav could be allowed to reach approximately at the optical power setup voltage Vref within a single burst cell. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a timing chart of the APC circuit <b>50</b> where the time constant of the low-pass filter <b>54</b> is reduced. As is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, although the response speed might be increased, the ripple component is not removed completely, so that an error occurs in the convergence value according to the amplitude of the ripple. This error is also strongly dependent upon the pattern of the data signal D; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, if &#x201c;1&#x201d; and &#x201c;0&#x201d; appear alternatively, the amplitude of the ripple is relatively small.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, if the data signal is such that values of the same symbol appear continuously, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the ripple becomes large, so that the error of the convergence value tends to increase accordingly. In this way, with the prior art scheme, it is difficult to achieve automatic power control with high speed and high convergence accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additionally, with degradation detection of a burst-type data for the laser diode <b>52</b>, a similar problem occurs. That is, if the time constant of the low-pass filter <b>54</b> is increased, although the accuracy might be enhanced, degradation detection could not be implemented within a single burst cell. In contrast, if the time constant of the low-pass filter <b>54</b> is reduced to enhance the response speed, the ripple of the monitoring average value Vav increases, so that an alarm signal is often generated at times when the degradation level is not reached. As a result, when a burst-type signal is handled, the prior art degradation detection scheme is unsuitable.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention is designed to solve the afore-described problems and to provide a light-emitting element drive apparatus that can provide increased convergence speed and improved convergence accuracy for the light-emitting output required during transmission of burst data, even when the time constant is set a little shorter.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention also provides a light-emitting element drive apparatus comprising: a drive current generation circuit for outputting a drive current to a light-emitting element, the drive current causing the light-emitting element to emit light with a pre-determined optical output based on a data signal; a sensing light-receiving element for receiving light from the light-emitting element and outputting a sense signal that corresponds to the optical output thereof; a first filter for smoothing the sense signal; and a second comparison circuit for comparing the smoothed sense signal from the first filter and a pre-determined setup signal to determine whether the light-emitting element has degraded or not.

Thus, for the light-emitting element, light-emitting control with high speed and high accuracy can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The light-emitting element degradation setup signal input to the second comparison circuit is generated by the level adjustment circuit such that the setup signal generated by the setup signal generation circuit is attenuated to a pre-determined level. As a result, the light-emitting element degradation setup signal is input to the second comparison circuit as a signal that accounts for the ripple component and delay of the sense signal. Thus, high-speed and high-accuracy light-emitting element degradation detection can be achieved, without providing additional special circuitry used only for degradation detection.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the present invention is described in detail below according to one embodiment thereof where it is embodied in a laser diode drive apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an electrical block circuit diagram of a laser diode drive apparatus, where a monitoring photodiode <b>11</b> as a sensing light-receiving element receives light of a laser diode <b>12</b> as a light-emitting element, and outputs a monitor current Im that corresponds to the received optical output Pf. The monitor current Im of the monitoring photodiode <b>11</b> is output to a current-to-voltage conversion circuit <b>13</b>. The current-to-voltage conversion circuit <b>13</b> includes a shunt resistor R, across which the monitor current Im is conducted, and outputs the resulting terminal voltage across the shunt resistor R to a first low-pass filter (LPF) <b>14</b> as a monitor voltage Vm. The first low-pass filter, as a first filter, smoothes the monitor voltage Vm. The low-pass filter <b>14</b> then outputs the smoothed monitor voltage Vm to a first comparison circuit <b>15</b> as a monitoring photodiode average-value signal (monitoring average value) Vav.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first comparison circuit <b>15</b>, which includes a comparator, an operational amplifier, and so forth, receives the monitoring average value Vav as a sense signal, as well as the optical power setup voltage Vref, which is input as a setup signal. The first comparison circuit <b>15</b> compares the monitoring average value Vav and optical power setup voltage Vref, and outputs the comparison result, as a control signal, to a laser diode current control circuit (current control circuit) <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The current control circuit <b>16</b> receives the comparison result, and outputs, based on the comparison result, a control signal to a bias current drive circuit <b>17</b> and modulation current drive circuit <b>18</b>, respectively, that comprise a drive current generation circuit, thereby increasing or decreasing the bias current Ib or modulation current Ip, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The bias current drive circuit <b>17</b> controls, in accordance with the control signal based on the comparison result from the current control circuit <b>16</b>, the level value (current amount) of the bias current Ib as a light-emitting threshold current of the laser diode <b>12</b>. The modulation current drive circuit <b>18</b> receives the data signal D, and outputs the modulation current IP to the laser diode <b>12</b> in response to the data signal D. The modulation current drive circuit <b>18</b> controls the level value (current amount) of the modulation current IP in accordance with the control signal based on the comparison result from the current control circuit <b>16</b>. Thus, the sum of the bias current Ib and modulation current Ip is supplied as the drive current to the laser diode <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, the setup voltage generation circuit as the setup signal generation circuit that generates the optical power setup voltage Vref is described. The setup voltage generation circuit <b>20</b> includes a delay compensation circuit <b>21</b> as a delay circuit; a pulse modulation circuit <b>22</b>; a second low-pass filter <b>23</b>; a third low-pass filter <b>24</b>; and a variable direct-current voltage source <b>25</b>. The delay compensation circuit <b>21</b> receives the data signal D that is supplied to the modulation current drive circuit <b>18</b>. The delay compensation circuit <b>21</b> delays the data signal D by a pre-determined delay time, before it is output to the next-stage pulse modulation circuit <b>22</b>. The delay time is the time to compensate for the delay introduced in the modulation current drive circuit <b>18</b>, laser diode <b>12</b>, monitoring photodiode <b>11</b>, and so forth, when the monitoring average value Vav is output from the first low-pass filter based on the data signal D. More specifically, it is the time when the timing of the optical power setup voltage Vref output from the third low-pass filter based on the data signal D coincides with the timing of the monitoring average value Vav being output from the first low-pass filter <b>14</b> based on the data signal D. Thus, the delay time at the delay compensation circuit <b>21</b> is determined in consideration of the delay times for the delay compensation circuit <b>21</b>, pulse modulation circuit <b>22</b>, second low-pass filter <b>23</b>, and third low-pass filter <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The data signal D delayed at the delay compensation circuit <b>21</b> is output to the pulse modulation circuit <b>22</b>. The pulse modulation circuit <b>22</b> receives the direct-current setup voltage Vps from the variable direct-current voltage source <b>25</b>. The direct-current setup voltage Vps is a direct-current voltage that corresponds to the optical power setup voltage Vref as described in the explanation of the prior art, and is used to determine whether the optical output Pf of the laser diode has reached its desired optical output Pos, as compared to the monitor voltage Vm. The pulse modulation circuit <b>22</b> modulates the direct-current setup voltage Vps with the data signal D. That is, the direct-current setup voltage Vps is modulated by the pulse modulation circuit <b>22</b> to produce a post-modulation setup voltage Vpml shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, which has the same frequency component as the data D shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The post-modulation setup voltage Vpm<b>1</b> is output to the second low-pass filter <b>23</b>. The second low-pass filter <b>23</b> waveform-shapes the post-modulation setup voltage Vpml so that it is similar to the waveform of the monitor voltage Vm output from the current-to-voltage conversion circuit <b>13</b>. More specifically, the monitor voltage Vm output from the current-to-voltage conversion circuit <b>13</b> has a voltage waveform that is muted depending upon circuit constants, such as parasitic capacitance and wire capacitance of the monitoring photodiode <b>11</b>, parasitic capacitance of the current-to-voltage conversion circuit <b>13</b>, and so forth. Thus, the second low-pass filter <b>23</b> is designed to waveform-shape the post-modulation setup voltage Vpml into a muted waveform that is similar to the monitor voltage Vm, with the same circuit constants.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The post-modulation setup voltage Vpml is waveform-shaped by the second low-pass filter <b>23</b> and output as a second post-modulation setup voltage Vpm<b>2</b> to the third low-pass filter <b>24</b>. The third low-pass filter <b>24</b> waveform-shapes the second post-modulation setup voltage Vpm<b>2</b> under the same conditions as for the first low-pass filter <b>14</b>, and outputs the resulting waveform-shaped signal as the optical power setup voltage Vref.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, the optical power setup voltage Vref has the same waveform, that is, ripple component, as the monitoring average value Vav, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. Furthermore, the delay compensation circuit <b>21</b> allows the optical power setup voltage Vref outputted from the third low-pass filter <b>24</b> based on the data signal D to be synchronized with the monitoring average value Vav output from the first low-pass filter <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Accordingly, the first comparison circuit <b>15</b> can compare the monitoring average value Vav against the optical power setup voltage Vref that has the same ripple component as the monitoring average value Vav and is also synchronized therewith. Asa result, the first comparison circuit <b>15</b> can achieve comparison with a high degree of accuracy, while minimizing the error due to the ripple component and the error due to the delay of the monitoring average value Vav. Furthermore, if the monitoring average value Vav exceeds the optical power setup voltage Vref, the first comparison circuit <b>15</b> outputs a sense signal to a H level (high potential), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 2E</figref>. In contrast, if the monitoring average value Vav falls below the optical power setup voltage Vref, the first comparison circuit <b>15</b> outputs a sense signal to a L level (low potential), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 2E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thus, the current control circuit <b>16</b> outputs a control signal to the bias current drive circuit <b>17</b> and modulation current drive circuit <b>18</b>, respectively, in accordance with the comparison result of the first comparison circuit <b>15</b>. That is, the current control circuit <b>16</b> generates and outputs a control signal for supplying a drive current (=IP+Ib) for the laser diode <b>12</b> such that the optical output Pf of the laser diode <b>12</b> reaches a desired optical output Pos. As a result, the laser diode <b>12</b> is controlled to emit light with the desired optical output Pos at all times.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The monitoring average value Vav from the first low-pass filter <b>14</b> is output to a second comparison circuit <b>31</b>. The second comparison circuit <b>31</b> inputs the monitoring average value Vav, as well as inputting an optical power degradation setup voltage Vd from an attenuator <b>32</b> that serves as a level adjustment circuit. The attenuator <b>32</b> inputs the optical power setup voltage Vref generated by the setup voltage generation circuit <b>20</b>, and generates the optical power degradation setup voltage Vd as a light-emitting element degradation setup signal. The attenuator <b>32</b> converts the optical power setup voltage Vref to a pre-determined lower level to generate an optical power degradation setup voltage Vd that has the same ripple component as the monitoring average voltage Vav. More specifically, the level conversion performed by the attenuator <b>32</b> is to convert the level to the monitoring average value Vav at the time when the laser diode <b>12</b> degrades as the optical output Pf relative to the drive current (=IP+Ib) of the laser diode <b>12</b> falls below a pre-determined light-emitting output.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, the second comparison circuit <b>31</b> can compare the monitoring average value Vav against the optical power degradation setup voltage Vd that has the same ripple component as the monitoring average value Vav and is also synchronized therewith. Then, if the monitoring average value Vav falls below the optical power degradation setup voltage Vd, the second comparison circuit <b>31</b> outputs a H-level (high potential) drive signal for driving an alarm device, which is not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Accordingly, if the laser diode <b>12</b> degrades so that its light emission is not controlled to its desired optical output Pos, and the optical output Pf falls below the optical power degradation setup voltage Vd, it is determined that the laser diode <b>12</b> has degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The features of the laser diode drive apparatus so configured are described below. (1) In the present embodiment, the optical power setup voltage Vref generated by the setup voltage generation circuit <b>20</b> is provided as a waveform having the same ripple component as the monitoring average value Vav, and is also output to the first comparison circuit <b>15</b> in synchronization with the monitoring average value Vav. Then, in the first comparison circuit <b>15</b>, the monitoring average value Vav is compared against the optical power setup voltage Vref that has the same ripple component as the monitoring average value Vav and is also synchronized therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thus, even if the time constant of the first low-pass filter <b>14</b> is reduced to increase the response speed, the first comparison circuit <b>15</b> can achieve comparison with high accuracy, while minimizing the error due to the ripple component and the error due to the delay in the monitoring average value Vav. As a result, light-emission control of the laser diode <b>12</b> can be achieved with high speed and high accuracy that are demanded for a burst-type data signal D.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">(2) In the present embodiment, the optical power setup voltage Vref generated by the setup voltage generation circuit <b>20</b> is level-converted via the attenuator <b>32</b> before it is output to the second comparison circuit <b>31</b> as the optical power degradation setup voltage Vd. Then, the optical power degradation setup voltage Vd input to the second comparison circuit <b>31</b> provides a waveform that is synchronized with the monitoring average value Vav.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thus, the second comparison circuit <b>31</b> can achieve comparison with high accuracy, while minimizing the error due to the ripple component and the error due to the delay in the monitoring average value Vav. As a result, degradation detection for the laser diode can be achieved with high response time and high accuracy that are demanded for a burst-type data signal D.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">(3) In the present embodiment, the setup voltage generation circuit <b>20</b> is also used to generate the optical power degradation setup voltage Vd. That is, the need for providing a setup voltage generation circuit that is used only for degradation detection of the laser diode is eliminated by merely including the attenuator <b>32</b>. Thus, the size of the circuitry as the drive apparatus can be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It should be appreciated that the embodiment of the present invention may also be modified as follows. The pulse modulation circuit <b>22</b> and variable direct-current voltage source <b>25</b> disposed prior to the waveform-shaping circuit having the second low-pass filter <b>23</b> and third low-pass filter <b>24</b> are used to adjust the level of the optical power setup voltage Vref that is inputted to the first comparison circuit <b>15</b>. Instead, the waveform-shaped signal output from the waveform-shaping circuit having the second low-pass filter <b>23</b> and third low-pass filter <b>24</b> may be level-adjusted to output the resulting optical power setup voltage Vref to the first comparison circuit <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, the data signal that is delayed by the delay compensation circuit <b>21</b> is input to the waveform-shaping circuit having the second low-pass filter <b>23</b> and third low-pass filter <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The waveform-shaped second post-modulation setup voltage Vpm<b>2</b> is then level-adjusted by a DC controller <b>26</b> that serves as a level conversion circuit having an attenuator and so forth, and the resulting level-adjusted signal is output to the first comparison circuit <b>15</b> as the optical power setup voltage Vref.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The optical power setup voltage Vref is also output to the attenuator <b>32</b>. It is then level-converted at the attenuator <b>32</b> to produce an optical power degradation setup voltage Vd, which is output to the second comparison circuit <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In that case, light-emission control of the laser diode <b>12</b> can also be achieved with high speed and high accuracy, as well as degradation detection, in a similar manner to the afore-described embodiment. In addition, because the DC controller may merely be provided, as compared to the afore-described embodiment, the size of the circuitry as a drive apparatus can be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The afore-described embodiment has been embodied in the drive apparatus for the laser diode <b>12</b> as a light-emitting element. It may also be applied to drive apparatuses for light-emitting diodes and other light-emitting elements. The afore-described embodiment has been embodied in the monitoring photodiode <b>11</b> as a light-receiving element. It may also be implemented by changing it to phototransistors and other light-receiving elements.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the afore-described embodiment, the optical power degradation setup voltage Vd is generated by using the optical power setup voltage Vref for controlling the light emission of the laser diode <b>12</b> that is generated by the setup voltage generation circuit <b>20</b>. Instead, it may also be implemented by providing a dedicated setup voltage generation circuit used only for the optical power degradation setup voltage Vd.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to the invention described in claims 1 through 6, light-emission control for a light-emitting element can be achieved with high speed and high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to the invention described in claims 2 and 7, degradation detection for a light-emitting element can be accomplished with high speed and high accuracy.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a method of producing video screen holograms, a real video screen is illuminated by means of a narrowband light for producing a hologram of the real video screen. A plurality of individual recordings is carried out, each covering only a partial area of the real video screen being imaged in the hologram. The individual recordings take place, for example, by means of a scanning pulsed laser beam. The individual recordings are assembled to form the video screen hologram of the entire video screen. A recording device for this purpose comprises a scanning device for guiding the light radiation over the video screen and a light source which generates pulsed light radiation. The light source is, for example, a laser system with a pulsed q-switched oscillator and with an optical parametric oscillator.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of German patent document 199 34 162. 1, filed 21 Jul. 1999 and PCT International Application No. PCT/DE00/02220, filed 6 Jul. 2000, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a method and apparatus system for producing video screen holograms, and to a video screen hologram.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Video screen holograms, which are produced as holographic images of real white video screens or video projection screens and are recorded by means of lasers in the primary colors red, green and blue (rgb), have the advantage that they are effective only within a narrow spectral range about the recording wavelength, and at the same time only within a very limited projection angle about the direction of incidence of the reference beam during the preceding hologram recording. The method of operation of such screens or holographic video screens is described in detail in German Patent Applications No. 19700162.9 and No. 19703592.2.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the light sources for the projection, rgb lasers in the continuous wave mode and in the pulsed mode as well as rgb light-emitting diodes can mainly be used. The image build-up can optionally be implemented by the serial scanning of a collimated laser beam or by the imaging of an image modulator in the expanded beam of a laser or a light-emitting diode onto the screen. Holographic video screens can be produced for both front and rear projection. Because of their wavelength selectivity and directional selectivity, bright, high-contrast images of a high color fidelity can be projected onto video screen holograms even in a daylight environment. The projector with the narrowband light sources is placed at the beam origin of the divergent reference beam. Only from there will the projection light be efficiently diffracted out of the hologram toward the viewer. The diffuse broadband ambient light, for example, can traverse the video screen hologram unhindered from all other directions of incidence.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,163 discloses, for example, a holographic projection screen which has an arrangement of partial screen surfaces. Each partial screen surface is formed by a hologram, during whose recording a diffuser is holographically imaged as an object by means of an objective beam and a reference beam in a photo plate. This is to permit a speckle-free imaging for large-surface, semicircular projection screens.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,926,294 also shows the production of a hologram element in which a diffuser plate is holographically imaged as an objective. The hologram elements are assembled to form a projection screen.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For the reproduction or the projection of images onto video screen holograms, for example, rgb lasers are used, as described in &#x201c;RBG Optical Parametric Oscillator Source&#x201d;, K. Snell et al., Aerosense 99, and in German Patent Documents DE 195 04 047 and DE 44 32 029.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The possible applications of video screen holograms extend over the broad field of small displays (for example, for a single person in vehicles and airplanes or at office workstations), to large-surface screens for several viewers at events. Smaller displays can be recorded by means of frequency-stable rgb continuous-wave lasers. In this case, the high requirements with respect to the stability of the laser and of the course of the beam and the connected high expenditures are disadvantageous and result in high cost.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An image representation on large video screen holograms which is independent of the ambient light would be very attractive, for example, for many different applications in the home and the office, for television, computers and electronic cinema and for projections in lecture halls, movie theaters and open-air theaters. However, the production of larger video screens, for example, of the size of typewriter paper (DIN A4) or larger, presents considerable technical difficulties.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">First, the output power of the strongest continuous-wave lasers for hologram recordings is currently limited to only a few watts, which, for the particularly suitable silver halide and photo polymer materials, starting at a size of 1 m<sup>2</sup>, requires a lumination time of tens of minutes. For these long lumination times, the requirements for the mechanical and thermal stability of the material, with respect to the optical components of the beam path and with respect to the frequency stability of the laser, are particularly high.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Second, during recording of the hologram, the object beam and reference beam must be expanded at the expense of the light output over the size of the video screen and of the hologram, because the radial intensity distribution is not constant over the laser beam. Rather, it follows a normal distribution which requires a considerable widening in order to achieve a lighting which is as homogeneous as possible over the surface of the holograms. When several video screen holograms are joined together to create a large video screen hologram, the intensity drop toward the edges of the individual luminated holograms is particularly disturbing because a periodic shadow pattern then runs through the entire video screen during the projection.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Third, the luminating of the three rgb colors of three lasers into the same hologram results in difficulties because a uniform luminating of all three lasers over a larger surface is difficult to achieve. Because the wavelengths of the lasers are clearly different, differences occur in the beam transmission by refraction, diffraction and scattering at different points of the entire beam path, which leads to a nonuniform color display and is difficult to eliminate in the case of an imaging over an extensive surface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus which can produce high-quality small and large-surface video screen holograms in a simple manner.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another object of the invention is to create a video screen hologram which can also be implemented on a large-surface without degradation of the image quality during projection.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and other objects and advantages are achieved by the method and apparatus for producing video screen holograms according to the invention, in which a real video screen is illuminated by means of a narrowband light to produce a hologram of the real video screen, and a large number of individual recordings are made in which only one partial area of the real video screen is illuminated. In this manner, a video screen hologram of the entire video screen is obtained by a composition and/or superimposing of the individual recordings. Because the illumination is performed by means of a scanning pulsed laser beam, it is possible to use only very brief luminating times so that disturbances during the lumination (for example, by shocks or other instabilities) are avoided. Furthermore, there is no occurrence of intensity reductions at the edge or of periodic shadow patterns, and a uniform color display becomes possible on large surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The pulse duration is, for example, dimensioned such that the movement of the laser beam over the video screen has no influence on the interference of the light waves in the hologram. The recorded partial areas of the video screen preferably correspond to the size of image pixels or are larger. In particular, the lumination can take place by means of a pulsed diode-pumped solid-state continuous-wave laser.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A frequency conversion preferably takes place in one or more of the wavelength ranges red, green, blue. For example, a contact hologram or a video screen plane hologram is produced. A transmission hologram or a reflection hologram may also be produced. Laser beams are preferably generated with a coherence length which is greater than the difference of the light paths between the object beam and the reference beam. The scanning rate and the pulse duration are, for example, coordinated with one another such that the movement of the laser beam during a pulse is less than 1/10 of the wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the video screen surface is scanned repeatedly by means of a respectively phase-shifted laser beam. The distribution of the lumination can be measured in order to correct the lumination during a subsequent lumination cycle. Several luminations may also be carried out by means of light rays or laser beams which are polarized perpendicular to one another in order to produce two mutually independent screen images in the hologram. Furthermore, several luminations with changed recording parameters can be carried out, for example, a changed site of the real video screen or a changed place of origin of the reference beam. The lumination preferably takes place simultaneously by means of light rays or laser beams of the primary colors red, green, blue, which are coaxially adjusted on a beam axis.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The device according to the invention for producing video screen holograms has a narrow-band light source for illuminating a real video screen. This light source is, for example, arranged such that the light emanating from the video screen is superimposed with a reference beam in order to produce a hologram of the video screen, in which case, a scanning device is provided for guiding the light radiation emanating from the light source over the video screen, the light source generating a pulsed light radiation. As a result, high-quality large-surface video screen holograms can also be produced in a simple manner.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The light source preferably simultaneously generates a red, green and blue laser radiation. The light source comprises particularly a laser system which will be described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The laser system used for producing RGB rays is suitable particularly for the generating of video screen holograms. It comprises a laser beam source for generating laser radiation, a frequency conversion device, and an optical-parametric oscillator, the laser beam source comprising a pulsed q-switched laser oscillator. By means of this laser system, large-surface video screen holograms for a color projection with a high image quality can be produced in a simple manner.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The q-switched laser oscillator is preferably a single-frequency IR oscillator. The laser beam source has, for example, a laser amplifier which is connected behind the q-switched laser oscillator. The video screen hologram according to the invention has a holographic recording material in which a real video screen is stored as a hologram, and contains a large number of individual recordings in each of which a partial area of the real video screen is imaged as a hologram, the entire image of the video screen resulting from assembled and/or superimposed individual recordings. This results in a high-quality image reproduction, even in the case of a large-surface implementation of the video screen hologram.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The video screen hologram is preferably produced according to the method of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic lateral view which illustrates the recording of a reflection hologram of a video screen as a contact hologram for later front projection. A holographic recording material <b>12</b> is in contact with a video screen <b>11</b>. A laser beam bundle <b>13</b> from a rapidly pulsed laser <b>16</b> is scanned by means of scanners <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> over the recording material <b>12</b> in two axis directions x and y in a surface-covering manner, for example, by means of a circular-shaped laser beam spot. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a top view of the holographic recording material <b>12</b>. The laser beam <b>13</b> successively illuminates a partial area <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the recording material <b>12</b> and of the video screen <b>11</b> situated behind the latter. Differently shaped laser spots, such as a rectangle, may also be used. A portion of the impinging laser radiation <b>13</b> is allowed by the hologram or the recording material <b>12</b> to pass through and impinges on the real video screen <b>11</b> which scatters radiation <b>17</b> as object light waves back into the hologram <b>12</b>. There, the object light waves again impinge on the incident beam <b>13</b> and, together with its waves, form holographic interference patterns which are stored by the luminating process as a hologram in the recording material <b>12</b>. Many different scanning techniques can be used, such as raster scans, sinusoidal scans or spiral scans.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, the video screen hologram is not recorded as a whole in one piece as an image of the real video screen <b>11</b> but in a very large number of individual recordings, in each of which only small portions <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the real video screen <b>11</b> are illuminated. The entire image of the video screen <b>11</b> will then be obtained as a composition or superimposition of the large number of individual recordings, for example, in the manner of image pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The produced video screen hologram is constructed as a contact hologram or as a so-called image plane hologram, in which the projected image when displayed appears in the hologram plane. By luminating screens in the primary colors red, green and blue into the same hologram layer <b>12</b> or into three layers laminated onto one another, colored images can later also be projected onto the holographic screen.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Contact holograms have the advantage of a simple optical construction during the recording. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the hologram is therefore placed in contact onto the real video screen <b>11</b>, for example, a reflecting scattering lens or transmitting obscured glass and is luminated together with the reference beam without any additional object illuminating. During the projection, the angle of the backscattered projection light from the hologram <b>12</b> in the direction of the viewer is the same as that of the real video screen with respect to the recording light beam <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The invention is based on the fact that the holographic video screen or the hologram <b>12</b> must reflect the optical characteristics of the image pixels, that is, the brightness (half-tone), the color, the polarization and the angle of radiation only individually for each pixel from the screen. An optical linking between adjacent pixels does not exist, and a video screen as a contact or image plane hologram has only a two-dimensional structure. So that the hologram <b>12</b> can reflect this method of operation of a flat video screen in the hologram plane, it is not absolutely necessary to record the real video screen <b>11</b> in a single lumination over an extended hologram surface, as takes place in the case of holograms of three-dimensional objects, but the video screen may be constructed as an assembled film or a film constructed in a mosaic-type of separate individual recordings of partial areas <b>11</b><i>a </i>of a video screen. These partial areas <b>11</b><i>a </i>may therefore be reduced to the size of an individual image pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The holograph video screen is recorded by luminating the real larger video screen <b>11</b> with a rapidly pulsed laser beam <b>13</b> which is scanned without gaps over the entire surface. To ensure that the movement of the beam <b>13</b> over the screen <b>11</b> or over the recording material <b>12</b> has no influence on the interference of the light waves in the hologram <b>12</b>, on the one hand, the pulse duration of the laser <b>16</b> is kept sufficiently short, and on the other hand, the coherence length of the laser light is sufficient to form the interferences. In order to achieve a particularly economical production of the holographic screen, the pulse repetition frequency of the laser <b>16</b> and its median power is sufficiently high so that a short luminating time is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Suitable lasers for this type of holographic lumination are, for example, high-power, rapidly pulsed, diode-pumped infrared solid-state continuous-wave lasers with only a single longitudinal mode whose radiation is displaced by frequency conversion into the red, green and blue wavelength range. The scanning of the video screen surface can take place by means of commercially available laser beam scanners.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The partial holograms <b>11</b><i>a </i>are selected at least large enough that no disturbances occur, such as a reduction of contrast, color distortion and reduction of the image resolution in the later image reproduction by light diffraction or a fine structure of the holograms itself. Such disturbances are not expected if the partial holograms <b>11</b><i>a </i>are larger than the image pixels of the projection. On the other hand, the size and the shape of the partial hologram <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the scanning rate can be selected such that, by means of the defined operating parameters of the recording laser, such as the median power and the pulse repetition frequency, an optimal irradiation and a homogeneous illumination of the hologram <b>12</b> is achieved without reducing the efficiency of the recording simultaneously by the movement of the scanning beam <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In general, for the recording of object holograms, the object itself must be illuminated by means of an object beam and the hologram must be illuminated by means of a reference beam. The light scattered by the object is then superimposed with the reference beam in the hologram film. In the case of the pulsed recording illustrated in which only a portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the real video screen <b>1</b> is illuminated as the object and simultaneously a portion of the hologram <b>12</b> is illuminated directly by means of the pulsed reference beam <b>13</b>, the luminations are implemented in a synchronously superimposed manner. This can easily be implemented by means of contact holograms, in which the hologram film <b>12</b> is placed directly on the real video screen <b>11</b> and the reference beam <b>13</b> is used both for illuminating the hologram <b>12</b> and for illuminating the video screen <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the case of image plane holograms, the video screen is imaged by means of a lens into the hologram. So that the partial illumination of the video screen with the object beam and the hologram with the reference beam mutually overlap, the two scanning beams must be mutually synchronized during their movement, such that the imaged spot of the video screen in the hologram and the spot of the reference beam will in each case be congruent.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">During the lumination, the light waves in the object beam and the reference beam must be coherently imposed on one another in the hologram. This means that the coherence length of the used illumination laser <b>16</b> has to be at least as large as or larger than the difference of the light paths between the waves of the object beam and the reference beam which originate from a common beam, until they meet again in the hologram <b>12</b>. Within the scope of the invention, this requirement can be met by a corresponding design of the beam guidance and the build-ups of the holograms with respect to the coherence length of the available lasers.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The movement of the interfering waves in the hologram by the scanning beams (object beam and reference beam) during the pulse duration, with respect to one another and with respect to the hologram film, amounts to no more than fractions of the wavelength (&#x3c;&#x3bb;/10). This condition is met by a corresponding adjustment of the scanning rate corresponding to the pulse duration of the laser. In the case of a pulse duration of 10 ns and a scanning rate of 5 m/sec, the movement of the beam is, for example, 50 nm, which corresponds to approximately &#x3bb;/10.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">During the scanning with a pulsed radiation at a constant power from pulse to pulse, a large hologram surface can be covered with a uniform average intensity distribution. However, the lumination (that is, the light intensity times the time) depending on the ratio of the scanning rate to the pulse repetition frequency of the beam with the Gaussian intensity profile, will be periodically modulated over the whole surface along the scanning sweep. The invention therefore also provides that this periodic local non-uniformity of the illumination as well as inhomogeneities in the hologram thickness, for example, in the case of a mosaic-type laying of several holograms side-by-side, are compensated by a repeated scanning of the same surface by means of a phase-shifted scanning beam or by controlling the pulsed power. Here, the invention partly utilizes the characteristic of hologram recordings that several object luminations can be stored in an overlapping manner and independently of one another in a single hologram.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">So that this lumination process can take place automatically, in one embodiment of the invention (not shown), the distribution of the lumination is monitored by a calibrated backscatter sensor which is arranged in the beam path of the illumination laser coaxially to the pulsed lumination beam. As an alternative, monitoring cameras may continuously measure the laser illumination over the entire hologram surface. The lumination pattern thus obtained can be stored by a microprocessor or computer, and can be used during subsequent repeated scanning cycles over the entire hologram surface by controlling the laser light intensity and surface distribution of the scanning figure for the subsequent correction of the lumination of the preceding lumination patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">After the development process, the optical characteristics of the video screen are stored in the hologram <b>12</b>. Preferably, so-called thick holograms (10&#x2013;20 &#x3bc;m) are used, for example, consisting of photopolymer, dichromate gelatin or silver halide materials. In comparison to thin holograms, thick holograms have the advantage that they particularly selectively diffract out light with the same wavelength as during the recording, specifically only when the angle of incidence of the reconstruction beam is the same as the angle of incidence of the reference beam during the recording.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The optimal accumulated lumination of the holograms differs for each material and for each wavelength. For photopolymer materials, for example, it is at approximately 25 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>; that is, for the lumination of 1 m<sup>2 </sup>with a laser 1 W of median power, 250 seconds or approximately 4 minutes are required. In the case of silver halide films, a lumination of only approximately 0.5 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, is necessary, so that the lumination time can be correspondingly shortened. Image plane holograms are recordings of screens imaged by means of lenses or mirrors, which screens are situated in the hologram plane. The angle of radiation of these holograms can be considerably narrowed by the imaging geometry, with a corresponding increase of the brightness of the image, which is very advantageous for many applications.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a recording of a contact hologram of a video screen <b>31</b> as a transmission hologram <b>32</b>. In this case, it is necessary that a reference bundle of beams <b>33</b>, whose beam path coincides with the projection beam during the later image reproduction, impinges as a convergent partial beam bundle of a pulsed laser <b>39</b> on the hologram <b>32</b>. The interference structures which then form in the hologram <b>32</b> as the result of the superimposition of scattered light <b>30</b> from the screen on the reference bundle <b>33</b> of beams, will then correspond to an image reproduction in a rear projection from the intersection or projection point <b>36</b>, that is, the lengthening of the beam bundle <b>33</b>. During the projection, the viewer will then stand opposite the later projection point <b>36</b> on the opposite side of the hologram <b>12</b>. The generating of a convergent bundle of beams from a two-axis scanner <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> can most easily be implemented by way of a mirror <b>37</b> of a long focal length which images the source point of the scanner <b>38</b> in the intersecting point <b>36</b>. The hologram <b>32</b> and the real video screen <b>31</b> are then placed in a sectional plane of the beam path of the partial beam bundle <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a recording of a transmission hologram as an image plane hologram for the rear projection. Here, a real video screen <b>41</b> is imaged by means of a lens <b>46</b> on a hologram <b>42</b>. Simultaneously, a reference beam bundle <b>43</b> impinges from the other side on the hologram <b>42</b>. The two scanners with the x-y scanner mirrors <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> or <b>47</b>&#x2032; and <b>48</b>&#x2032; are synchronized such that the two illumination spots of the reference beam bundle <b>43</b> and of the illuminated surface <b>40</b> of the real screen in the hologram <b>41</b> are synchronously superimposed. The illumination beams for the real screen <b>42</b> and for the reference bundle <b>43</b> of beams are separated and deflected by means of separator mirrors <b>44</b> and deflecting mirrors <b>44</b>&#x2032; from the common laser <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a recording of image plane hologram as a reflection hologram for the later front projection. In this case, a real screen <b>51</b> is imaged in a hologram plane <b>52</b> by means of a lens <b>56</b>, and the image is synchronously superimposed there with a reference bundle <b>53</b> of beams. By means of a separator mirror <b>54</b>, a portion of the reference bundle <b>53</b> of beams can be used for illuminating the real screen <b>51</b>. Additional auxiliary mirrors are required for compensating the space reflection of the lens <b>56</b>, which is illustrated here for the one space plane on the example of the auxiliary mirror <b>55</b>. For the simultaneous scanning of the screen <b>51</b> and the hologram <b>52</b>, only one pair of scanner mirrors <b>57</b> and <b>58</b> is used here in front of the pulsed laser <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In order to facilitate the recording of three-color or multicolor screens, for example, of the rgb colors, the beams of three rgb lasers or of one laser with a three-color rgb emission are coaxially adjusted with respect to an identical beam axis. During a joint scanning and luminating of the screen and of the hologram with the reference beam, the three colors are simultaneously on the real video screen. The reference beam also represents a superimposition of three rgb partial beams.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">This simultaneous recording of all three rgb colors in the same hologram naturally requires that the hologram material is photosensitive to all colors. However, this also applies to a number of photopolymers and silver halide films as well as to individual dichromate gelatins.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For recording the video screen holograms described here with a rapidly pulsed rgb illumination, modern diode-pumped, q-switched infrared solid-state lasers are used with an emission in only one longitudinal resonator mode. The lasers are adjusted to the rbg emission at the suitable rgb wavelengths by a classical frequency conversion, such as frequency doubling, optically parametric processes and summation and difference frequency formation, in various non-linear crystals.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Separate lasers can be used for the individual colors, but it is more advantageous to use lasers which have a single joint q-switched laser oscillator. The lasers have joint amplifier stages on the output side and a joint optical-parametric oscillator which splits the fundamental wave of the laser or its frequency-doubling wave into two partial waves of a longer wavelength (idler and signal wave). A subsequent beam separation is used for separating the primary radiation into different beam branches, where different further frequency conversions take place, such as frequency doubling, frequency summation and difference formation for producing the individual colors.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A significant advantage of such a joint primary laser is the fact that the emission of all three rgb color branches takes place completely synchronously with the same pulse repetition frequency, in a solid phase and with a comparable spectral width, coherence length and beam divergence. This permits a joint recording of the video screen holograms simultaneously in all colors.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">RGB lasers, which are based on this basic concept of a joint primary laser with a subsequent frequency conversion in passive non-linear crystals to the three rgb colors, are described, for example, in the above-mentioned German Patent Document DE 195 04 047, &#x201c;Laser System for Color Image Projection&#x201d;, and in German Patent Document DE 44 32, 029, &#x201c;Laser-Supported Color Image Display and Projection Device&#x201d;. The diode-pumped solid-state lasers described there are operated in the mode-locked continuous-wave mode. However, with respect to the recording of video screen holograms, they have the disadvantage that they emit a wide frequency spectrum of individual longitudinal modes, that is, of a short coherence length in the primary emission as well as after the frequency conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a laser according to the invention which is particularly suitable for the above-described pulsed video screen hologram recordings. In this case, instead of a mode-locked laser, a rapidly pulsed q-switched single-frequency IR oscillator <b>61</b> of an Nd laser, such as Nd:YLF, Nd:YAG or Nd:YVO, is provided; that is, the oscillator <b>61</b> has a single longitudinal mode. The power amplification of the pulses takes place in a solid-state laser amplifier <b>62</b> of the same materials. An optical parametric oscillator <b>65</b> is provided for subsequent frequency splitting. This oscillator can be adjusted in its wavelength by way of the temperature of the non-linear material and/or the adjustment of the axis angle in the beam path. As a result, the wavelength of the effective rgb radiation can also be adjusted during the subsequent frequency conversion. This is advantageous for precisely adapting the recording wavelength to the later reproduction wavelength. A frequency doubling and summation frequency formation also takes place. The oscillator <b>61</b>, is a q-switched Nd:YAG in the longitudinal single-mode operation. The laser amplifier <b>62</b> is an Nd:YAG or Nd:YVO amplifier chain. Furthermore, a frequency doubler crystal <b>63</b> is provided as well as beam separators <b>64</b>, <b>64</b>&#x2032; for separating the fundamental radiation of the primary laser &#x3bb;<sub>l</sub>=1.06 &#x3bc;m from the frequency-doubled green radiation &#x3bb;<sub>g</sub>=0.53 &#x3bc;m. The optical parametric oscillator <b>65</b> is pumped by means of the green beam &#x3bb;<sub>g </sub>and adjusted such that it generates two signal and idler beams (&#x3bb;<sub>s </sub>and &#x3bb;<sub>i </sub>respectively), which have a suitable wavelength for a subsequent summation frequency formation in summation frequency generators <b>66</b>, <b>67</b>. In this case, the wavelengths &#x3bb;<sub>s </sub>and &#x3bb;<sub>i </sub>are selected such that the summation frequency formation with the beams of the fundamental wavelength of the laser &#x3bb;<sub>i</sub>=1.06 &#x3bc;m (or 1.04 &#x3bc;m), which remains after the frequency doubling, results in suitable wavelengths of red and blue. In contrast, the color green is taken over as part of the frequency-doubled radiation of the primary laser by way of splitting by the simple beam separator <b>64</b>, <b>64</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The suggested rapidly pulsed q-switched laser <b>61</b> is a continuous-wave laser oscillator with only one longitudinal fundamental mode which is operated in a pulsed operation of the resonator. A laser of this type is, for example, a diode-pumped solid-matter microchip laser, such as the Nd:YAG at a laser wavelength 1.06 &#x3bc;m with such a short resonator that it starts lasing only on a longitudinal mode. By means of an internal passive quality switch, for example, made from the known Cr<sup>4+</sup>:YAG material, the resonator can be adjusted by doping with Cr<sup>4+</sup> ions, for example, to 20 kHz pulse frequency with a pulse duration of 10 ns.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The IR-emission of the laser <b>61</b> is now highly amplified in the amplifier <b>62</b> which follows; for example, by means of the crystal Nd:YAG or Nd:YVO, by a factor <b>10</b>&#x2013;<b>100</b>, without creating interfering higher longitudinal modes, also while maintaining the good beaming quality of the oscillator. After the amplification, the pulsed beam is then still frequency-doubled to the desired green wavelength 532 nm, which occurs here in a KTP crystal <b>63</b>. After the frequency doubling, which takes place here with an efficiency of approximately 30%, a portion of the primary radiation with a wavelength of 1.06 &#x3bc;m remains for a further use in the subsequent stages.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A second possibility is the use of passively quality-switched Nd:YAG ring lasers with the same Cr<sup>4+</sup> YAG quality switch, a similar pulse repetition frequency, but a better frequency stability and a higher median power. By means of subsequent amplifier stages as in the previous case, a median power of 10&#x2013;39 W can be generated in a longitudinal mode.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">One possibility is the use of a laser actively quality switched by means of an acoustic-optical switch with an internal standard for adjusting a single-mode operation. This arrangement, however, requires slightly higher expenditures in comparison to the second process.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Q-switched continuous-wave lasers of the type described here have a pulse repetition frequency of 10&#x2013;20 kHZ, a pulse width of 5&#x2013;20 ns and a frequency bandwidth of the laser emission below 100 MHz. They can be designed with an amplifier stage such that, after the frequency doubling 1 W green emission is created, and by means of two or three stages, up to 10 W green radiation is generated and 30 W infrared radiation is generated in the device. After the conversion in the optical parametric oscillator <b>65</b> and a further frequency doubling or summation frequency formation, all rgb beams can then be produced with a median power of several watts. A significant advantage of this concept is also that the colors blue and red can be continuously displaced by the adjustment of the wavelengths of the idler and signal wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>s</sub>, &#x3bb;<sub>i </sub>in the optical parametric oscillator <b>65</b> for the adaptation to the wavelength of the later image projection lasers.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">By means of the characteristic laser data, such laser systems are particularly suitable for the recording of the video screen holograms. If, for example, the pulse duration of the laser amounts to 10 ns and the scanning rate amounts to 5 m/sec, the beam moves laterally by 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>m during this pulse duration, which corresponds to 1/10 of the wavelength at, for example, 500 nm. This small displacement has no noticeable influence on the quality of the interference pattern in the hologram. If the pulse frequency were, for example, 20 kHz, the beam would move from pulse to pulse at this scanning rate by &#xbc; mm. The coherence length of a &#x394;t=10 ns single-mode pulse amounts to approximately &#x394;t c=3 m, wherein c is the speed of light. The difference of the travelling paths of the object and reference beam must not exceed this value, which can easily be observed in the case of all suggested embodiments of the holograms.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, video screen holograms can be designed either for a front projection as a reflection hologram, or for a rear projection as a transmission hologram. Recording in both the contact process with the real video screen and as an image plane hologram (that is, after an imaging of the video screen on the hologram, as illustrated above) are suitable for both processes. In all cases, the object beam and the reference beam are moved synchronously over the hologram.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Only light sources with an identical linear polarization can interfere with one another and be stored as a holographic image of screens in a hologram; that is, only light waves of an identical linear polarization in the reference beam and the object beam can contribute to generating the image of the video screen. Therefore, the lasers used for the recording of the holograms are preferably polarized in a strictly linear manner in order to ensure the efficiency and the homogeneity of the illumination over the entire hologram surface. Since most lasers with a good beaming quality are strictly linearly polarized from the start, this does not cause any limitation of the recording technique.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For recording of video screens for stereoscopic image reproduction, video screen materials are used which depolarize an impinging linearly polarized light beam by backscattering or by forward scattering. This applies to many projection screen materials for the rear projection with a good fine roughness of the surface or a slight volume scattering, and to almost all projection screens with a high volume scattering for rear projections. Since the reference beam also has a strict polarization direction of the laser, when a real video screen is recorded, this polarization direction is maintained in the hologram. If now two recordings are successively made of the same screen, in which the polarization direction of the reference beam is rotated from one to the other by 90&#xb0;, two independent screen images are created in the same video screen hologram, each being effective only with respect to a projection beam with a defined polarization direction. Both screen images affect mutually orthogonal polarized projection beams. Thus, also prerequisites are met for the projection of mutually orthogonally polarized stereo images and their stereoscopic viewing by means of polarization glasses.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The switch-over of the polarization by 90&#xb0; in the reference beam can be carried out very simply by rotating a &#x3bb;/2-plate in the beam path behind the outlet aperture of a strictly linearly polarized illumination laser.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If several video screen recordings are made of the same screen successively into the same hologram while the site of the whole screen or of the place of origin of the reference beam are changed, the interfering speckle images are superimposed coherently with a statistical size distribution. Together, they represent a new virtual screen after the luminations, which screen has a significantly higher fine structure than the real original screen. This results in a displacement of the entire appearance image toward larger speckles which then, during the subsequent image reproduction, can be eliminated more easily by a slight local or time-related modulation of the projection beams. Therefore this technique utilizes the ability of holograms to store several images with slightly changed recording condition above one another but independently of one another in the same hologram. Also in the case of video screen holograms which are recorded by means of pulsed lasers, the size of the interfering image speckles which occur during the image reproduction by means of lasers can therefore be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The method described here of recording a scattering holographic video screen can also be used for recording the function of a plane mirror which basically represents only a borderline case of a scattering surface. Because of their selectivity in the wavelength, such holographic mirrors can advantageously be used as auxiliary elements in the recording devices or in the projectors.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A programming technique for a one-time-programmable non-volatile memory (NVM) utilizes a repeated programming cycle with an interval between cycles that is long enough to redistribute charge in the layers surrounding the floating gate of the cell. Each cycle programs the floating gate and also the surrounding layers. The cycling saturates in an equilibrium state when the electric field form outside to the floating gate equals zero. This technique eliminates the first stage of conventional VT drop in NVM cells and, thus, improves retention.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 4,698,787, issued on Oct. 6, 1987, discloses as prior art the conventional electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM) device structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> EPROM transistor device includes a source <b>10</b> and a drain <b>12</b> formed on a substrate <b>14</b>. The source <b>10</b> and the drain <b>12</b> define a channel <b>16</b> in the substrate <b>14</b>. Positioned above the channel <b>16</b> is a layer of insulating material that forms a gate dielectric layer <b>18</b>. A floating gate <b>20</b> of semiconductor material is formed over the gate dielectric layer <b>18</b>. A second layer <b>22</b> of insulating material is formed over the floating gate <b>20</b>. Finally, a layer of semiconductor material is formed over the second layer of insulating material <b>22</b> to form a control gate <b>24</b>. Field oxide <b>26</b> isolates the transistor structure from periphery devices. Electrical connections <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> are provided for applying voltages to the drain <b>12</b>, gate <b>24</b>, and source <b>10</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Programming of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> EPROM cell is accomplished by raising the potential of the drain <b>12</b> (e.g. 8&#x2013;12V), holding the source <b>10</b> at ground and applying a programming voltage pulse (e.g., approximately 13&#x2013;21V) to the control gate <b>24</b> for a preselected period of time (e.g., 1&#x2013;10 milliseconds). The result of these conditions is that a conductive region is established in the channel <b>16</b> across which electrons <b>32</b> are accelerated. The conductive region is designated by the dashed line <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The magnitude and polarity of the voltages applied to the drain <b>12</b>, the source <b>10</b> and the gate <b>24</b> are such that this conductive region is &#x201c;pinched off&#x201d; in a region adjacent to the drain <b>12</b>. This causes electrons <b>32</b> to be raised sufficiently in potential so that they become &#x201c;hot.&#x201d; These &#x201c;hot&#x201d; electrons create additional electron/hole pairs by impact ionization. In this condition, these electrons are elevated to an energy level that permits them to overcome the insulating properties of the gate dielectric <b>18</b>. The hot electrons can thus &#x201c;jump&#x201d; the potential barrier of the gate dielectric <b>18</b>. Due to the electric field created by the control gate, the hot electrons are attracted to the floating gate <b>20</b> where they are stored, thereby programming the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The above-cited '787 patent also discloses a programming mechanism for an electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The EEPROM cell structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> utilizes a different programming mechanism than does the EPROM cell described above. As with the EPROM structure, the EEPROM structure includes a drain <b>36</b>, a source <b>38</b>, a floating gate <b>32</b> separated from the substrate by a gate oxide layer <b>43</b>, a gate <b>40</b> separated from the floating gate <b>32</b> by another layer of oxide <b>45</b>, all of which are deposited or thermally grown. However, the EEPROM structure differs from the EPROM structure in that it provides a thin tunnel dielectric <b>46</b> between the drain <b>36</b> and the floating gate <b>42</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the portion of the floating gate that is positioned above the tunnel dielectric <b>46</b> is positioned on the drain region <b>36</b>. Further, the portion of the gate <b>40</b> that is aligned with the tunnel dielectric <b>46</b> is also positioned on the drain <b>36</b>. Programming (and erasing) of this structure is achieved by inducing potential differences between the gate <b>48</b> and drain <b>50</b> that are on the order of 20V. The thin dielectric region coupled with the high voltage between the gate <b>48</b> and the drain <b>50</b> induces &#x201c;Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To program the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> cell, i.e. to place electrons on the floating gate <b>42</b>, the drain region <b>50</b> is held at ground potential while the gate <b>48</b> is pulsed for approximately 10 milliseconds at a potential of approximately 20V. During the programming operation, the source region <b>38</b> is allowed to float. Under these conditions, electrons tunnel through the tunnel dielectric <b>46</b> to the floating gate <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The '787 patent also discloses another EEPROM cell structure, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>. In this structure, a relatively shallow drain region <b>54</b> and a deeper source region <b>56</b> are formed in a silicon substrate <b>52</b>. A channel <b>58</b> is defined between the source <b>56</b> and the drain <b>54</b>. A gate dielectric <b>60</b> is formed over the channel <b>58</b> and extends over the channel <b>58</b> and to extend between the drain <b>54</b> and to overlap a portion <b>62</b> of the source <b>56</b>. The gate dielectric <b>60</b> has a relatively uniform thickness over its entire cross section. A floating gate <b>64</b> is formed over the gate dielectric <b>60</b>. A second layer of dielectric material <b>66</b> is formed over the floating gate <b>64</b>. A control gate <b>68</b> is formed over the seconfd layer of insulating material <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Programming of the cell shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>is achieved by raising the drain region <b>54</b> and the control gate <b>68</b> to predetermined potentials above that of the source region <b>56</b>. For example, in one programming scheme, the drain <b>54</b> is raised to between 4&#x2013;6V, while the control gate <b>68</b> is pulsed at about 10&#x2013;12V for approximately 0.5&#x2013;5 msec. Under these conditions, &#x201c;hot&#x201d; electrons are generated and accelerated across the gate dielectric and onto the floating gate. Thus, the programming operation for this cell is similar to that of a conventional EPROM cell.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">U.S. Pat. No. 6,137,723, issued on Oct. 24, 2000, discloses a so-called &#x201c;Frohmann-Bentchkowsky&#x201d; memory transistor, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> device includes spaced-apart p-type source region <b>70</b> and drain region <b>72</b> formed in an n-well <b>74</b>, which in turn is formed in a p-type silicon substrate <b>76</b>. A channel region <b>78</b> is defined between the source region <b>70</b> and the drain region <b>72</b> and a layer of gate oxide <b>80</b> is formed over the channel region <b>78</b>. A gate <b>82</b> is formed over the gate oxide layer <b>80</b>. A layer of insulating material <b>84</b> along with gate oxide <b>80</b> encapsulates the floating gate <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> cell is programmed by applying biasing voltages to the well <b>74</b> and to the drain region <b>72</b> that are sufficient to induce avalanche breakdown. For example, avalanche breakdown is induced by applying ground to the well <b>74</b> and a negative breakdown voltage to the drain <b>72</b>, while either grounding or floating the source region <b>70</b>, or by applying a positive breakdown voltage to the well <b>74</b> and ground to the drain <b>72</b>, while floating or applying the positive breakdown voltage to the source <b>70</b>. The baising voltages that are sufficient to induce avalanche breakdown establish a strong electric field across the drain-to-well junction depletion region. The strong electric field accelerates electrons in the junction depletion region into substrate hot electrons. A number of these substrate hot electrons penetrate the gate oxide layer <b>80</b> and accumulate on the floating gate <b>82</b>, thereby programming the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each of the cells described above is exemplary of a programming scheme for a non-volatile memory (NVM) cell. One of the basic properties of NVM cells is the ability to maintain charge on the floating gate within a required period of time (retention). The method to control retention is to monitor the threshold voltage VT of the cell over time. A typical dependence of VT versus time is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> plot shows two mechanisms in effect with different characteristics that are commonly attributed to two leakage mechanisms: an initial leakage mechanism that leads to a significant VT shift within a short time (seconds or minutes) followed by a more gradual decrease in VT over a much longer period of time (e.g. 10 years).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention is based upon the concept that the initial radical VT shift is not related to leakage fro the floating gate, but rather may be attributed to charge redistribution in the dielectric layers/interfaces that surround the floating gate that effect the floating gate voltage due to capacitive coupling, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. That is, after programming, the floating gate has a negative voltage that results in an electric field directed to the floating gate. This electric field forces positive charges to move toward the floating gate where they can be trapped at some of the interfaces. This process stops when the amount of trapped charge is sufficient to reduce the electric field outside the interface to zero. After erasing, the mechanism works in the same way.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the polysilicon floating gate electrode is formed on gate oxide which, in turn, is formed on the composite. Additional oxide and plasma enhanced TEOS (PETEOS) insulates the floating gate, as does surrounding SION and PETEOS.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, the present invention is directed to one-time-programmable NVM applications wherein the programming operation is performed in fabrication of the NVM device and only once. The programming method utilizes a repeated programming cycle with an interval between cycles that is long enough to enable a redistribution of charge in the layers surrounding the floating gate. At room temperature, this cycle period may be about once a day; at temperatures of 200&#x2013;250&#xb0; C., it may be accelerated, to about once per 30 minutes or shorter.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each programming cycle programs the floating gate of the device, in a manner as described above that is consistent with the structure and programming bias conditions of the type disclosed above, and also the surrounding layers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This programming cycling will saturate in an equilibrium state when the electric field from outside the floating gate is equal to zero, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. This eliminates the first dramatic stage of VT drop (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and, thus, improves retention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Instead of the cycling described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a slow ramp of programming control gate voltage may be used. The character time of this ramp should be equivalent to a few programming cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be understood that the particular embodiments of the invention described above have been provided by way of example and that other modifications may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as expressed in the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates generally to the field of marine seismic surveying. More particularly, the invention relates to cables and to systems for towing cables through a body of water. The invention is also related to methods and apparatus for reducing drag of cables moving relative to water.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Marine seismic surveying is known in the art for determining structures and compositions of geologic formations underlying large geographic areas below the bottom of a body of water. One or more seismic vessels tow cables through the water to transport acoustic energy sources and acoustic signal detectors. It is known in the art for a seismic vessel to simultaneously tow a plurality of laterally spaced apart sensor cables in a wide swath through the water. Each cable in the swath may extend thousands of meters behind the seismic tow vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Lateral separation of the sensor cables from each other in a swath is typically performed by marine diverters, a well known type of which is a paravane. The diverters move the cables laterally from the path of vessel travel. Lateral separation of the sensor cables requires that some of the cables in the acquisition system extend laterally from the direction of vessel travel to be pulled through the water. The resistance resulting from pulling cables laterally through the water greatly increases the energy required for towing the cables, resulting in an increase in fuel cost. The turbulence created by pulling cables laterally through the water also increases acoustic noise, and thus results in an increased noise level in the signals detected by seismic (acoustic) sensors deployed in the cables, thereby reducing the signal-to-noise ratio and degrading the quality of the recorded signals.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Cable drag is a significant force that must be overcome by a seismic tow vessel. Cable drag results from skin friction and surface pressure variations induced by viscous effects, and especially those due to separation bubbles or regions. Separation regions result when three-dimensional boundary layers depart from a body surface. Such separation causes vortex shedding which increases cable drag and induces a type of acoustic noise called &#x201c;strumming.&#x201d; Such noise interferes with seismic data acquisition and must be filtered from the acoustic signals recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is not uncommon for seismic energy sources, associated cables and other equipment to produce more than 20,000 pounds (9080 kgf) of drag against a tow vessel Accordingly, a significant amount of energy is expended by a seismic vessel in towing conventional seismic acquisition systems through the water. As the size of marine seismic acquisition systems increases and as the tow speeds increase, a need exists for improved systems to reduce drag forces and to increase tow efficiency through the water.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Compressed air provided by vessel-mounted compressors is used to power air guns in conventional marine seismic operations. In additional to using compressed air to generate seismic signals, it is known in the art to release air bubbles in water to modify the seismic signal generated by marine air guns. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,618,024 issued to Domenico (1986), U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,302 issued to Clark (1986), and U.S. Pat. No. 4,632,213 issued to Domenico (1986) each discloses a seismic source system releasing bubbles to form a gas-water mixture paraboloid or &#x201c;acoustic lens&#x201d; in the water. Moreover, U.S. Pat. No. 5,959,938 issued to Behrens (1999) discloses a manifold for releasing bubbles in water to control the bubble size and attenuation characteristics of the water. None of these references, however, discloses using gas or air to reduce drag of the seismic array components being towed through the water.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is a need to increase tow efficiency, a result of which would be fuel savings. Less cable drag could also increase the tow capacity of a seismic vessel and could also enable laterally wider arrays to be towed during seismic surveying.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One aspect of the invention is a method for improving the flow of a cable through water. The method includes releasing a gaseous bubble stream proximate an outer surface of the cable as the cable moves with respect to the water.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another aspect of the invention is a cable for towing marine devices. The cable includes a strength member and at least one conduit associated with the strength member. The conduit has apertures therein at selected locations along the conduit. The conduit and associated apertures are adapted to conduct gas from a source into water in which the cable is disposed.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention provides a system for increasing the efficiency with which a cable moves relative to water. One particular application of the invention is related to towing cables behind a vessel. Generally speaking, embodiments of a towed cable system according to the invention include a conduit for distributing air or gas bubbles proximate the surface of the towed cable to reduce the drag forces on the cable as it is towed through the water. More specifically, a cable according to the invention is typically used where the cable extends in a direction at least in part transverse to a direction of motion of the water with respect to the cable length. In seismic surveying, such a cable would extend at least in part transversely to a direction of motion of a seismic vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a typical configuration for a marine seismic data acquisition system. A seismic vessel <b>22</b> is shown moving in a selected direction, indicated by reference designator D. The vessel <b>22</b> tows a lead in cable <b>9</b> located roughly centrally behind the vessel <b>22</b>. The vessel <b>22</b> also tows, at each side thereof, a diverter tow cable, each of which is shown at <b>11</b>. A marine diverter <b>26</b> is disposed at the trailing end of each diverter tow cable <b>11</b> to exert a lateral thrust on the diverter tow cables <b>11</b> to spread them laterally away from the center of the vessel <b>22</b> as the vessel <b>22</b> travels along the selected direction D.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The diverters <b>26</b> are held at a selected lateral distance from each other in a direction transverse to the direction of motion D. The selected lateral distance is controlled by lengths of spreader cables <b>13</b> disposed between the diverters <b>26</b>. Attached to the spreader cables <b>13</b> at selected positions along the length of the spreader cables <b>13</b> are plurality of streamer cables <b>28</b>. Each streamer cable <b>28</b> includes a plurality of seismic sensors, usually hydrophones, at selected positions along each streamer cable <b>28</b>. The seismic sensors are each shown generally by reference numeral <b>29</b>. The vessel is also shown towing two seismic energy sources <b>36</b>, which may be air gun arrays of any type well known in the art. While in the present embodiment the seismic sources <b>36</b> are air gun arrays, any other type of seismic energy source may be used with the invention, and therefore the type of seismic source is not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the vessel <b>22</b> pulling six such streamer cables <b>28</b> and two seismic energy sources <b>36</b>, however, marine seismic acquisition systems known in the art use different numbers of streamer cables and seismic sources. Therefore, the number of streamer cables and seismic energy sources shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the diverter tow cables <b>11</b> and the spreader cables <b>13</b> all extend, to a greater or lesser extent, laterally from the center of the vessel in a direction transverse to the direction of vessel travel D. It is understood that other configurations may be used for deploying a plurality of streamer cables behind a towing vessel, but whatever configuration is used for maintaining a plurality of streamer cables at selected laterally spaced apart positions behind a towing vessel, there will be a need to pull at least one cable having a laterally extending component through the water <b>18</b>. Laterally as used herein means in a direction transverse to the direction of motion D of the vessel <b>22</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, cables having at least some lateral component along the length thereof include the diverter tow cables <b>11</b> and the spreader cables <b>13</b>. Cable structures according to the invention, which will be explained below, are typically used where such cables extend laterally with respect to the direction of motion of the water with respect to the cable, as previously explained. In the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, cables according to the invention would typically be used for the diverter cables <b>11</b> and spreader cables <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The vessel <b>22</b> also typically includes a seismic recording system <b>24</b> which may include signal recording devices (not shown), seismic source controllers (not shown), navigational equipment (not shown) and an air compressor <b>24</b>A which provides air to be controllably discharged by the seismic sources <b>36</b>, and provides compressed air to cables made according to the invention, as will be further explained. The recording system <b>24</b> and its components may be of any type well known in the art. The compressor <b>24</b>A, as it relates to the invention, is one type of a source of compressed air or gas. Using a cable according to the invention only requires a gas source, which, for example, may be in the form of a tank of compressed gas (or air), as an alternative to the compressor <b>24</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further includes air pressure sensors/control valves <b>30</b> (or pressure regulators), which may be disposed at selected positions along the spreader cables <b>13</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The purpose of the control valves <b>30</b> will be further explained. Other embodiments of a system may not include control valves.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Having shown generally a towed cable system which may use a cable according to the invention, several general forms of a cable according to the invention will now be explained. Broadly described, a cable according to the invention includes a strength member and a gas (or air) conduit associated with the strength member. In some embodiments of a cable according to the invention the gas (or air) passageway, chamber or conduit is integrally formed with the strength member. The conduit includes apertures which conduct the gas or air from within the conduit to locations proximate to or on the exterior surface of the cable. In other embodiments, the conduit forms a separate structure associated with the strength member.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the size, geometric arrangement and/or density of the apertures are selected to provide a particular distribution of air or gas bubbles around the cable as it is towed through the water.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Any embodiment of a cable according to the invention may or may not include electrical conductors and/or optical fibers to conduct electrical power and signals to and from the various devices towed by the cable.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Having described embodiments of a cable according to the invention in very general terms, specific embodiments of a cable according to the invention will now be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a cable <b>10</b> having a strength member, which in this embodiment is an exterior armor <b>12</b>. The exterior armor <b>12</b> may be formed from steel, woven high strength fiber, or other material known in the art for forming an exterior armor on a cable. The exterior armor <b>12</b> defines a conduit within the interior of the armor <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conduit is an annulus <b>14</b> formed between the exterior armor <b>12</b> and an interior strength member or reinforcing cable, shown generally at <b>34</b>. The reinforcing cable <b>34</b> may be formed from wire rope, steel, woven high-strength fiber or any other material known in the art to be used as a cable reinforcing member.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A plurality of apertures <b>16</b> are located in the exterior armor <b>12</b> and can communicate gas or air between the annulus <b>14</b> and the water <b>18</b> surrounding the cable <b>10</b>. As air or other gas is delivered into the annulus <b>14</b> from a source such as the compressor (<b>24</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Such air or gas is released through the apertures <b>16</b> and into the water <b>18</b> to form a plurality of air bubbles proximate to the exterior of the armor <b>12</b>. The size of such air or gas bubbles depends on the pressure of the air or gas in the annulus <b>14</b> and on the size, configuration, and orientation of the apertures <b>16</b>. As will be further explained with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the size and configuration of the apertures <b>16</b> may be selected in some embodiments to provide a predetermined distribution, pattern or arrangement of the air or gas bubbles.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the plurality of bubbles released from the apertures <b>16</b> form a shield or &#x201c;bubble zone&#x201d;, shown generally at <b>20</b>, which has a lower density than the surrounding water <b>18</b>. If the water <b>18</b> is moving past the exterior armor <b>12</b>, such as in a cable subjected to a moving water current, or in a body of water wherein the cable <b>10</b> is towed or otherwise moved laterally through the water <b>18</b>, then the bubble zone <b>20</b> will be distributed in a shape substantially as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a portion of the bubble zone <b>20</b> proximate to the exterior surface of the exterior armor <b>12</b>, drag forces acting against the exterior surface of the armor <b>12</b> are reduced, and vortex shedding around the cable <b>10</b> is also reduced, thereby reducing strumming and other vibration induced by movement of the cable <b>10</b> through the water <b>18</b>. Reductions in cable drag facilitate laminar flow of the water <b>18</b> past the cable <b>10</b>, and improve the overall tow efficiency of a vessel moving such a cable through water <b>18</b>, for example, the marine seismic acquisition vessel and system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the annulus <b>14</b> provides a conduit for conveying compressed gas or air through cable <b>10</b>. Because such compressed air or gas is less dense than the water <b>18</b> displaced, the compressed air also provides buoyancy to the cable <b>10</b> to help support the cable <b>10</b> at a selected elevation below the surface of the water <b>18</b>. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may also be made without the reinforcing strength member <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The cable <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may also include at least one electrical conductor <b>44</b> and at least one optical fiber <b>46</b> for carrying electrical power and signals between the vessel (<b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the devices towed by the cable (such as sensors <b>29</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and diverters <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Other embodiments may not have either electrical conductors or optical fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Another configuration of the conduit which is integrally formed within a strength member is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the strength member <b>34</b> comprises a plurality of wire rope or armor strands, shown individually at <b>35</b>, wound around a conduit <b>14</b>A in a well-known helical configuration. The armor strands <b>35</b> may be made from any material known in the art for making cable armor or strength members. The conduit <b>14</b>A in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may include a separate tube or hose, or may be formed only by the helical wrap of the armor strands <b>35</b> around the center of the pattern formed by the armor strands <b>35</b>. The conduit includes apertures <b>16</b> as in the previous embodiment for conducting gas or air to locations proximate an outer surface of the cable <b>10</b>. The apertures <b>16</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may include discrete, small tubes extending from the conduit <b>14</b> to proximate the outer surface of the armor strands <b>35</b>, or may be formed as interstices between armor strands <b>35</b> during the wrapping of the cable <b>10</b>. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may also include at least one electrical conductor <b>44</b> and at least one optical fiber <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As previously explained, other embodiments of a cable according to the invention may include a conduit or hose formed separately from the strength member. In one such embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, gas or air may be conveyed along the length of the cable <b>10</b> in a tube <b>52</b> disposed along the exterior of the strength member <b>34</b>. The strength member <b>34</b> may be wire rope, woven fiber or any other similar structure used to form a strength member for a cable, as in previously described embodiments. The tube <b>52</b> may be formed from any suitable substantially impermeable material. The cable <b>10</b> may include an exterior armor sheath, such as shown at <b>54</b>, formed from high strength material such as steel or woven high strength fiber and disposed externally to both the strength member <b>34</b> and the tube <b>52</b>. The tube <b>52</b> includes apertures <b>16</b> along its length to enable gas to be released into the water <b>18</b> as in the previously explained embodiments. The apertures <b>16</b> penetrate the exterior armor <b>54</b> as well. The tube <b>52</b> may extend longitudinally along the strength member <b>40</b>, or may be helically wound thereon. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may also include at least one electrical conductor <b>44</b> and at least one optical fiber <b>46</b>. Other embodiments configured similarly to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may exclude either or both the electrical conductor and the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An alternative to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the tube <b>52</b> is omitted, and the conduit <b>14</b>B is formed in an annular space between an exterior sheath <b>54</b>A and the strength member <b>34</b>. The exterior sheath includes apertures <b>16</b> therein as in previously described embodiments. The sheath <b>54</b>A may be formed from steel, woven fiber or other material that resists abrasion and is strong enough to move in water without damage. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> may also include at least one electrical conductor <b>44</b> and/or at least one optical fiber <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In other embodiments, as previously explained, a gas or air transporting conduit extends along the exterior of the strength member. One such embodiment of a conduit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which includes a strength member <b>34</b> having a conduit <b>56</b> disposed along the outer surface of the strength member <b>34</b>. The strength member <b>34</b> may be wire rope, woven fiber or any other similar structure used to form a strength member for a towing cable. The conduit <b>56</b> may extend directly along the length of the strength member <b>34</b> or may be helically wrapped around the strength member <b>34</b>. Helical winding of the conduit <b>56</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the conduit <b>56</b> includes apertures <b>16</b> therein to release gas or air to create bubbles along the length of the cable <b>10</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the conduit <b>56</b> comprises a substantially round cross-section hose or tube, however, other cross section shapes may be used in different embodiments. The conduit <b>56</b> may be formed from any suitable substantially impermeable material. Preferably the conduit <b>56</b> is formed from a material which will substantially maintain its cross-sectional shape as the cable <b>10</b> moves relative to surrounding water. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may also include at least one electrical conductor <b>44</b> and at least one optical fiber <b>46</b>. Other embodiments configured similarly to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may exclude either or both the electrical conductor and optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is similar in most respects to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, except that the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes two or more conduits <b>56</b> having apertures <b>16</b> therein. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the conduits <b>56</b> are disposed on opposite sides of the strength member <b>34</b>, but the conduits <b>56</b> may be disposed at any other position about the circumference of the strength member <b>34</b>. As in the previously described embodiments, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may include at least one electrical conductor <b>44</b> and at least one optical fiber <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the conduit, shown at <b>42</b>, comprises a tube or hose having a substantially flat rectangular or elliptical cross section. The conduit <b>42</b> also includes apertures <b>16</b> therein to communicate gas or air from within the conduit <b>42</b> to the water <b>18</b> surrounding the strength member <b>34</b>. As in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the conduit <b>42</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is helically wound around the exterior of the strength member <b>34</b>. Alternatively, the conduit <b>42</b> may extend along the length of the strength member <b>34</b>. An advantage that may be provided by the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is that the conduit <b>42</b> may be better able to retain its cross-sectional shape as the cable <b>10</b> moves with respect to surrounding water.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> the cable <b>10</b> includes a strength member <b>34</b>, such as formed from wire rope or the like. The strength member <b>34</b> may have disposed on it exterior surface or embedded therein at least one electrical conductor <b>44</b> and at least one optical fiber <b>46</b> for carrying electrical power and data signals, respectively, as in other embodiments. External to the strength member <b>34</b> is a sleeve <b>42</b> having channels <b>50</b> formed therein or on an exterior surface thereof. The sleeve <b>42</b> may be formed from an elastomeric material. The channels <b>50</b> form conduits for enabling passage of gas or compressed air. The channels <b>50</b> each include apertures <b>16</b> therein at selected positions to enable gas or air to move from the channels <b>50</b> into the water <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the foregoing embodiments described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> the strength member may be any suitable form of cable reinforcing strength member such as wire rope in braided or helically wound form, or any other flexible, tensile strength imparting device known in the art for use as a towing or support cable. Typically the strength member is made from steel or other high strength material, but it may also be partially or totally formed from fiber, fiber reinforced plastic or other material known in the art for use as a cable reinforcement or strength member. Accordingly, the exact structure and composition of the strength member are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates one embodiment of cable <b>10</b> wherein apertures <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B are positioned in different selected patterns on the cable exterior surface. By selecting the configuration of apertures, such as the helical pattern for apertures <b>16</b>A, or the circular patter for apertures <b>16</b>B, the distribution of air bubbles and the performance of the bubble zone (<b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) can be selected to suit a particular need or application. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also illustrates that the apertures <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B can also have sizes chosen to selectively control the size and distribution of air (or gas) bubbles as the bubble zone (<b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is generated proximate to exterior surface of the cable <b>10</b>. Different parameters of the apertures can be changed, such as increasing the size cross sectional area of the apertures as such apertures are located farther and farther away from the compressor (<b>24</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Because the pressure of compressed air or gas within the conduit (irrespective of its configuration) decreases from the end proximate the compressor (<b>24</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to the distal end of cable <b>10</b>, due to compressed air release through apertures <b>16</b> and due to internal friction of the moving air within the chamber (<b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), one embodiment of the invention includes smaller apertures (such as shown at <b>16</b>A) near the compressor-connected end of the cable <b>10</b>, and includes gradually increasing size apertures at distances farther and farther from the compressor (<b>24</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring once again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, air pressure sensors/control valves <b>30</b> can be attached to the cable (e.g. diverter tow cables <b>11</b> and/or spreader cables <b>13</b>) to monitor the pressure of the compressed air within interior passages (such as passage <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) at selected positions along the cable. Operation of the sensors/control valves <b>30</b> can be linked with a controller (not shown) to selectively increase or decrease the compressed air pressure supplied to discrete portions of the cable. Compressed air or gas pressure balancing or unbalancing of the cable can be performed in order to perform different functions. Compressed air pressure can be increased to discrete portions of cable <b>10</b> while air pressure is decreased to other portions of cable <b>10</b>, for example. Performance of cable <b>10</b> can be monitored in operation under tow and the performance characteristics of bubble zones <b>20</b> along different portions or cable exterior surface can be modified interactively.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The invention provides a bubble zone (<b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) proximate to a tow cable that can induce a transition from laminar to turbulent flow and can reduce vortex shedding as the cable is moved relative to water. The invention is particularly suited for vessels towing a cable through water, and more specifically is suited to seismic vessels towing sources and seismic sensor arrays. However, the invention is also applicable to uses where a relatively stationary cable is subjected to moving water. The invention is useful in applications where water moves relative to a cable, where the motion includes at least some component transverse to the length of the cable.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be limited only by the attached claims.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a National Stage application of International Application No. PCT/FI00/00687, which was filed on Aug. 11, 2000, which designated the U.S. and was filed in the English language.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a method for handling a call made by subscriber A using a subscriber terminal, which comprises a telecommunications part and an AV part for displaying audio and/or visual information, to a subscriber terminal of subscriber B when subscriber B is unable to answer. In the method, the terminal of subscriber A, or at least its AV part, is operationally connected to an audiovisual source for the time subscriber A waits for subscriber B to answer or to become available. When B answers or becomes available, the call is connected between subscribers A and B. The invention also relates to a telephone system comprising at least a terminal used by subscriber A, a terminal used by subscriber B, a switching centre for setting up a call between subscribers A and B, and connecting means for connecting subscriber A's terminal of to an audiovisual source when subscriber B is unable to answer. The invention further relates to a telephone apparatus comprising a telecommunications part, an AV part and a user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The method and the telephone system associated with it relate to offering call waiting services when subscriber A wishes to wait for subscriber B to answer or to become available, when B is busy or unable to answer. In practice, when subscriber B is unable to answer, the call made by subscriber A may be connected to an exchange where an operator asks whether subscriber A wishes to wait, or subscriber B may have a call waiting supplementary service, in which case, if A wishes to be put on hold, B will receive a call waiting tone indicating that a call is waiting.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior art mobile communications systems, such as the GSM system (Global System for Mobile Communications), comprise a Call Waiting Supplementary Service which indicates to subscriber B that a call is waiting, thereby allowing subscriber B to decide whether to accept, reject or ignore the waiting call. In addition, numerous private branch exchanges comprise a waiting functionality, which means that while waiting for the other party to answer, subscriber A may listen to music recorded on tape. Current solutions therefore only have two options to offer to subscriber A: either to drop the call or to hold and listen to a pre-selected audio source. In the latter case, subscriber A has to listen to music selected by subscriber B or the operator, for example. From subscriber A's point of view, the prior art solution is not particularly user-friendly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to solve the above described problem and to provide a solution offering increased user-friendliness and a wider range of options to subscriber A holding the line. This is achieved with a method of the invention characterized by offering a plural number of alternative AV sources to subscriber A, receiving information about the AV source selected by subscriber A, and connecting the terminal used by subscriber A, or at least its AV part, to the audiovisual source chosen by subscriber A. AV in this context refers to audio or visual information or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention also relates to a telephone system where the method of the invention can be applied. The telephone system of the invention is characterized in that the system comprises a plural number of alternative AV sources, and that connecting means are arranged to connect the terminal of subscriber A to an audiovisual source chosen by subscriber A when subscriber B is unable to answer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention further relates to a telephone apparatus with which the method of the invention can be utilized and which is suited to be used in the telephone system of the invention. The telephone apparatus comprises a telecommunications part, which the telephone apparatus uses for communicating with the network, and an audiovisual part which is used for relaying audio and/or visual information to the subscriber. The telephone apparatus of the invention is characterized in that the telephone apparatus also comprises an audiovisual source and connecting means for connecting the AV part to the AV source in response to control signals relayed from other parts of the telephone system to indicate that subscriber B is unable to answer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The basic idea of the invention is that it allows subscriber-specific wishes to be taken into account by giving the subscriber the possibility to choose the AV source he/she wishes to listen to and/or watch while waiting for the other party to answer or to become available. Hence the most significant advantage of the invention is that while waiting, the subscriber listens to and/or watches an audiovisual source that he/she finds pleasing and/or useful, instead of being dependent on call waiting tone services selected in advance by someone else.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention, subscriber-specific information about the AV sources selected by each subscriber is stored in advance into a memory means. When the called party is unable to answer, the connecting means connect the subscriber to an AV source corresponding to the subscriber information stored. The advantage of this is that the subscriber does not need to re-select the desired AV source every time.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment of the method of the invention, when the called party is unable to answer, the subscriber receives information about the AV sources that are available. The subscriber then selects an AV source, the choice is received, and the subscriber is connected to an AV source corresponding to his/her choice. This allows the subscriber to always choose the AV source that suits or pleases him/her best. The available AV sources may have been determined by subscriber A, the operator or another service supplier, or by subscriber B. The choice can be made using for example WAP technology (Wireless Application Protocol), in which case the subscriber selects the AV source from a menu sent to him/her, or IVR technology (Interactive Voice Response), in which case the subscriber enters his/her choice using the keys of the terminal according to the instructions and alternatives given as audio messages.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The telephone system of the invention can be implemented either in a mobile communications system or in a public telephone network. In a mobile communications system, the data about the AV sources selected by the subscribers may be stored into a home register. The data is then transferred together with other subscriber data as the subscriber moves in the system. In this case the connecting means that connect the subscriber to the selected AV source may be parts of an intelligent network, such as a Specialised Resource Function SRF or a Service Control Function SCF which read the data from the subscriber register and perform the connection in accordance with the data read.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A plural number of alternative AV sources may also be arranged at a private branch exchange, the connection to the selected AV source then taking place at the exchange when the party connected to the exchange is unable to answer. This solution is easy to implement, because the changes to be made to the system only affect the exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A telephone apparatus of a preferred embodiment of the invention is provided with an AV source that may include music stored into a memory, other stored audio and/or video material, or a radio. With this type of telephone apparatus, the information from the AV source is not transmitted to the subscriber over telephone connections, whereby the use of telephone links, and radio resources in particular, is reduced. The connection of the AV source to the AV part of the telephone apparatus is controlled by signals arriving from other parts of the system, such as from the switching centre serving subscriber B, from an exchange or from subscriber B's terminal, which first indicate that subscriber B is unable to answer and later inform when subscriber B becomes available.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The preferred embodiments of the method, telephone system and telephone apparatus of the invention are disclosed in the accompanying dependent claims.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a mobile communications system of the invention, which in this example is a cellular GSM system.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The mobile communications system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises two Mobile Switching Centres MSCA and MSCB which both switch calls between Mobile Stations MSA and MSB located within their coverage area through Base Station Controllers BSC<b>1</b> and BSC <b>2</b> and Base Transceiver Stations BTS<b>1</b> and BTS<b>2</b>. In this example, MSA is the subscriber A's terminal, i.e. the calling party, and MSB is subscriber B's terminal, i.e. the called party. The mobile switching centres MSCA and MSCB both comprise a Visitor Location Register, VLR<b>1</b> and VLR<b>2</b>, respectively, where information about subscribers presently located in the areas of the switching centres is maintained. The mobile communications system further comprises a Home Location Register HLR where information about the mobile subscribers registered into the network is maintained. The described mobile communications system comprises a plural number of audiovisual sources <b>3</b> which in this example only include audio sources. According to the idea of the invention, the information about the AV sources <b>3</b> selected by subscriber A may be stored in the home location register HLR from where they are copied, together with other subscriber information, into the visitor location registers VLR when the subscriber moves in the network. The described mobile communications system further includes an Intelligent Network part IN which comprises a Specialised Resource Function SRF and a Service Control Function SCF. The network element implementing the latter function is called a Service Control Point SCP. The service can be supplied for example in CAMEL service environment (Common Applications for Mobile Enhanced Logic). The specialised resource function SRF can be implemented using an element known as an Intelligent Peripheral IP. The above-mentioned intelligent network parts read the information indicating subscriber A's choice of AV source from the subscriber register HLR or VLR<b>1</b>, for example, and connect subscriber A's terminal MSA to the desired audio source <b>3</b>. The audio source alternatives may include recorded music or announcements, such as news reports and weather forecasts, commercials, or the radio. Network operators may also use a particular type of music or other audio material to build complete packages around a theme. Other audio source types are also possible.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating the method of the invention in which subscriber A has selected the AV source in advance, prior to making the call. In step <b>2</b>A subscriber A calls subscriber B's telephone number. In step <b>2</b>B is checked whether subscriber B is unable to answer and, if so, the routine proceeds to step <b>2</b>C where the subscriber register is searched for information about an AV source chosen in advance by subscriber A. This information may be stored for example in the home location register, in which case it is relayed together with other subscriber information as the subscriber moves in the system. The recording may be carried out for example when the telephone connection is registered by the network operator, or later by the subscriber. In an intelligent network it may then be possible to select the AV source for example by calling a service number or by using WAP technology. In step <b>2</b>D the terminal of subscriber A, or at least its AV part, is connected to an AV source corresponding to the information read from the register. Subscriber A listens to and/or watches the AV source until information arrives, in step <b>2</b>E, from other parts of the system, such as the switching centre serving subscriber B, or directly from B's terminal, indicating that subscriber B has become available. In step <b>2</b>F subscriber A is disconnected from the AV source and in step <b>2</b>G a normal call connection is established between subscribers A and B. If in step <b>2</b>B it is detected that subscriber B is not busy, then the routine proceeds from step <b>2</b>B directly to step <b>2</b>G.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating the method of the invention when subscriber A selects the AV source after he/she has found out that subscriber B is unable to answer. Steps <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B correspond to steps <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. If in step <b>3</b>B it is found out that subscriber B is not busy, then the routine proceeds directly to step <b>3</b>H, whereas if subscriber B is unable to answer, then the routine proceeds to step <b>3</b>C where information about the available AV sources is transmitted to subscriber A. This information may be given for example as audio messages to which subscriber A responds by using the telephone keys according to the instructions he/she hears over the phone, or subscriber A may receive a menu from which he/she makes the choice. In step <b>3</b>D the connecting means receive subscriber A's choice and in step <b>3</b>E they connect subscriber A's terminal, or at least its AV part, to the selected AV source. Subscriber A listens to and/or watches the AV source until in step <b>3</b>F information arrives from other parts of the system indicating that subscriber B has become available. In step <b>3</b>G subscriber A is disconnected from the AV source and in step <b>3</b>H a normal call connection is set up between subscribers A and B.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a signalling diagram illustrating the method of the invention when applied to the mobile communications system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In steps <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> . . . <b>4</b>-<b>3</b> subscribe A uses his/her terminal in an ordinary manner to call subscriber B's terminal. In step <b>4</b>&#x2014;<b>4</b> information is transmitted from subscriber B's terminal to the mobile switching centre MSCB serving subscriber B to indicate that B is unable to answer. Next, in step <b>4</b>-<b>5</b>, this information is transmitted further to the mobile switching centre MSCA serving subscriber A. In step <b>4</b>-<b>6</b> information is transmitted from the mobile switching centre MSCA to the service control function SCF to indicate that subscriber A is waiting. At the same time the service control function SCF is asked for further instructions. In response to the inquiry, the service control function SCF instructs the specialised resource function SRF in step <b>4</b>-<b>7</b> to connect the AV source corresponding to the subscriber information, i.e. the audio source in this case. At the same time, a message depicted as step <b>4</b>-<b>8</b> is transmitted from the service control function SCF to the mobile switching centre MSCA serving subscriber A to request a connection to be set up from subscriber A's terminal to the specialised resource function SRF. In step <b>4</b>-<b>9</b> subscriber A's terminal is connected to the specialised resource function SRF, and in step <b>4</b>-<b>10</b> a connection is set up for the sound from the audio source, after which subscriber A can listen to the audio source he/she has selected. In step <b>4</b>-<b>11</b> subscriber B is ready to answer, and information indicating this is first transmitted to the mobile switching centre MSCB serving subscriber B and further, in step <b>4</b>-<b>12</b>, to the mobile switching centre MSCA serving subscriber A. The mobile switching centre MSCA then sends in step <b>4</b>-<b>13</b> information to the service control function SCF to indicate that subscriber B is ready to answer. In step <b>4</b>-<b>14</b> the service control function SCF instructs the mobile switching centre MSCA to set up the call between subscribers A and B. In steps <b>4</b>-<b>15</b> . . . <b>4</b>-<b>18</b> this call connection is set up as usually. In step <b>4</b>-<b>19</b> the connection from subscriber A to the specialised resource function SRF is released, and in step <b>4</b>-<b>20</b> a normal call connection is set up between the terminals of subscriber A and subscriber B.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the telephone system of the invention comprising a private branch exchange <b>4</b>. The described telephone system includes subscriber A's terminal A, or MSA, subscriber B's terminal B, a public network switching centre <b>1</b> and a fixed private branch exchange <b>4</b> provided with connecting means <b>2</b> for connecting alternative AV sources, which in this case are audio sources <b>3</b>, to subscriber A's terminal A, or MSA. The private branch exchange is for example an exchange used by a company, or another group, which serves the company's extensions and communicates with the public telecommunication network. The private branch exchange may be either an automated exchange or a manual one. In the Figure the continuous line depicting telephone connections shows a case where terminal A of subscriber A is a subscriber terminal in the public telephone network, the broken line illustrating a case where subscriber A's terminal MSA is a mobile communications system terminal, in which case the call is not switched through the public network switching centre <b>1</b> but through the mobile switching centre MSCA, the base station controller BSC and the base station BTS. In both cases the alternative audio sources are connected to subscriber A's terminal A, or MSA, according to the same principles. When subscriber B is unable to answer, subscriber A can be asked whether he/she wishes to wait. The connecting means <b>2</b> can then transmit for example audio messages about the available audio sources to subscriber A, together with instructions on how to make a choice. Following the instructions, subscriber A can then select the desired audio source among the alternatives he/she has heard by using the telephone keys. The audio sources that may be used in this case include recorded music, various announcements and the radio.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a telephone apparatus of the invention. The described telephone apparatus is a mobile phone, although the telephone apparatus of the invention may also be one used in the fixed telephone network. In this example, the AV source of the telephone apparatus is an audio source, i.e. it only transmits audio information. The telephone apparatus shown in the Figure comprises a telecommunications part <b>5</b> which in turn comprises a radio part <b>6</b> provided with transmit and receive functions; an audio part <b>7</b> comprising a microphone and a loudspeaker; a user interface <b>8</b> comprising a display and a keypad; a controller <b>9</b>; an audio source <b>3</b>&#x2032; and connecting means <b>2</b>&#x2032; for connecting the audio source <b>3</b>&#x2032; to the audio part <b>7</b> under the control of the controller <b>9</b>, until information is received via the radio part <b>6</b> that subscriber B is ready to answer. The audio source <b>3</b>&#x2032; also comprises a memory M for recording audio data, an audio generator G for generating audio signals from the audio data, and a logic circuit LOG for controlling these. The audio source is selected by applying the user interface, i.e. by using the telephone keys according to the instructions appearing on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the telephone system of the invention implemented as a third-generation mobile communications system, which in this example is a UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System). It is to be understood that third-generation mobile communications system have not been fully standardized yet. The expressions and terms used should therefore be understood to be descriptive rather than limiting. For the sake of clarity, the Figure only shows subscriber terminal A together with the base station and the mobile switching centre serving the terminal, although the telephone system of the invention also comprises the subscriber terminal B.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The described UMTS mobile communications system comprises a mobile station MSA which functions as subscriber A's subscriber terminal and which has a radio connection to the base station BS and a data transmission connection further to a Radio Network Controller RNC. For circuit-switched connections, the radio network controller is connected to a Mobile Services Switching Centre MSC over an A interface, and for packet-switched services to a Serving GPRS Support Node SGSN, where GPRS stands for the General Packet Radio Service, over a Gb interface. The serving GPRS support node SGSN and the mobile services switching centre MSC may comprise separate UMTS elements. In the system, subscriber information is stored in the home location register HLR from where they are transferred, in connection with circuit-switched use, to the visitor location registers VLR of the mobile services switching centres MSC when the subscriber moves in the system. To interconnect the A and Gb interfaces of the GSM and GPRS systems, the Iu interface of the UMTS system may be provided with separate Interworking Units IWU. Information relating to the equipment is stored in an Equipment Identity Register EIR. To add and update subscriber-specific data, the system also comprises and Operation and Maintenance Section O&#x26;M with a Man-Machine Interface MMI. For creating additional services and for controlling them, the system is also provided with a Service Control Node SCN which is an advanced version of the service control point used in intelligent networks. From the mobile services switching centre MSC there is a connection further to circuit-switched networks and from the serving GPRS support nodes SGSN to packet-switched networks. The system includes a plural number of alternative AV sources <b>3</b> which are physically located at the specialised resource function SRF where they are controlled by the service control node SCN. The alternatives that can be used as AV sources include recorded music or announcements, such as weather forecasts and news reports, or commercials, radio, moving or still video pictures.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is to be understood that the above specification and the related drawings are only meant to illustrate the present invention. For example, information indicating that subscriber B has become available is not necessarily issued automatically, as in the above examples, but the waiting service used by subscriber A may include a step which is repeated at regular intervals to inquire the switching centre serving subscriber B whether B is still unable to answer. In this case the AV source remains connected until a response indicating that subscriber B is available is received to the inquiry. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many variations and modifications can be made to the invention without departing from the scope of protection of the invention disclosed in the attached claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to the field of wireless communication systems, and more particularly relates to the configuration of settings on a wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the advent of messaging devices and mobile telephones the wireless service industry has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry. The Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association calculates that 120 million Americans own a mobile telephone&#x2014;about half of the U.S. population. As the development of mobile telephones progresses, many mobile customers are upgrading to pricier phones and phone services that feature a plethora of settings, such as ring settings, battery settings, etc. The numerous number of settings often take considerable time to configure. In addition, settings must often be modified when the mobile telephone is used in different situations, such as in an office or in other locations where ringing is not appropriate. As a result, the management of the multitude of settings on mobile telephones today has become unwieldy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, accidental entry of information into the input pad of a mobile telephone has increased. As a user brings a mobile telephone to his head to begin speaking, the user's head often touches the input pad of the mobile telephone, prompting the mobile telephone to being entering information. This can cause unnecessary and unwanted entry of information into the mobile telephone or, even worse, accidental erasure of information in the mobile telephone.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Briefly, in accordance with the present invention, disclosed is a system, method and computer readable medium for configuring settings of a wireless device. In an embodiment of the present invention, the system on a wireless device includes means for detecting a user action indicating a particular mode for the wireless device. The means for detecting includes any one of means for detecting the proximity of a holster for holding the wireless device and means for detecting an on-call status and/or an off-call status of the wireless device. The system on a wireless device further includes a processor in the wireless device for configuring settings of the wireless device in response to the user action. The configuring of settings is performed any one of manually and automatically. The settings of the wireless device include at least one of a ring setting, a battery setting, an input pad setting and a device use setting.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment of the present invention, the system on a wireless device includes means for detecting the proximity of a holster for holding the wireless device, wherein if the holster is detected within a proximity threshold, a signal is generated. The wireless device further includes a processor in the wireless device for receiving the signal and for configuring settings of the wireless device. The means for detecting the proximity of the holster includes any one of a semiconductor, a reed switch, a circular conducting element, a switch and optical means. The settings of the wireless device include at least one of a ring setting, a battery setting, an input pad setting and a device use setting.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The configuration of the ring setting is beneficial when the wireless device is in the holster because it allows a user to avoid loud and/or disruptive ringing. When the wireless device is in the holster, there is no need for the device to ring due to the proximity of the wireless device <b>106</b> to the user. Thus, the vibration of the wireless device <b>106</b> notifies the user of an incoming call.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The configuration of the ring setting is also advantageous because it eliminates the repeated adjustment of the ring setting by a user when he enters into situation when a ring is not appropriate, such as in a movie theater or a place of worship. The configuration of the ring setting is further advantageous because it reduces the number of missed calls due to the removal of a wireless device from a user's person when the wireless device is set to vibrate. Users often miss calls when the wireless device is not attached to the user and it is set to vibrate. A preferred embodiment according to the present invention configures the wireless device to ring when it is removed from the holster, thereby allowing the user to hear the wireless device when it receives an incoming call.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The configuration of the battery setting is beneficial when the wireless device is in the holster because it saves battery life and allows for longer use of the wireless device between charges. When the wireless device is in the holster, there is no need for certain tasks or operations to continue, such as the backlight of the view screen of the wireless device. The present invention configures the battery setting of the wireless device to battery save mode when it is inserted into the holster, thereby saving battery life.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The configuration of the input pad setting is beneficial when the wireless device is in the holster because it eliminates the accidental entry of information via the input pad when the wireless device is not in use. When the wireless device is in the holster, there is no need for allowing the input of information into the wireless device via the input pad. The present invention configures the input pad setting of the wireless device to be disabled when it is inserted into the holster, thereby preventing accidental entry of information.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The configuration of the device use setting is beneficial when the wireless device has been removed from the holster for a set period of time because it prevents the unauthorized use of the wireless device by others. When the wireless device has been removed from the holster for a set period of time without use, the present invention configures the device use setting of the wireless device to be disabled. This security feature prevents the unauthorized use of the wireless device when it has been removed from the holster and is not in the possession of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The configuration of the input pad setting is beneficial when the wireless device is in use because it eliminates the accidental entry of information via the input pad when a user is speaking into the wireless device <b>106</b>. When the wireless device is in use by a user, there is often no need for allowing the input of information into the wireless device via the input pad. The present invention configures the input pad setting of the wireless device to be disabled when it is in use, thereby preventing accidental entry of information.</p>

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">I. Overview</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a conventional wireless communication system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a wireless service provider <b>102</b> operating on a wireless network <b>104</b>, which connects the wireless service provider <b>102</b> with wireless devices <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>. The wireless service provider <b>102</b> is a first-generation analog mobile phone service, a second-generation digital mobile phone service or a third-generation Internet-capable mobile phone service. The wireless network <b>104</b> is a mobile phone network, a mobile text messaging device network, or the like. Further, the communications standard of the wireless network <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) or the like. Alternatively, the communications standard of the wireless network <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a short range communications system such as Bluetooth, Infrared Data Association (IrDA) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The wireless network <b>104</b> supports any number of wireless devices <b>106</b> through <b>108</b>, which are mobile telephone phones, smart phones, text messaging devices, two-way messaging devices, handheld computers, messaging devices, beepers, or the like. A smart phone is a combination of 1) a pocket PC, handheld PC, palm top PC, or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and 2) a mobile telephone. Wireless devices <b>106</b> through <b>108</b> are described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a more detailed block diagram of a conventional wireless communication system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a more detailed block diagram of the wireless communication system described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> above. The wireless communication system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes the wireless service provider <b>102</b> coupled to base stations <b>202</b>, <b>203</b>, and <b>204</b>, which represent the wireless network <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The base stations <b>202</b>, <b>203</b>, and <b>204</b> individually support portions of a geographic coverage area containing subscriber units or transceivers (i.e., wireless devices) <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The wireless devices <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> interface with the base stations <b>202</b>, <b>203</b>, and <b>204</b> using a communication protocol, such as CDMA, FDMA, CDMA, GPRS and GSM. The wireless service provider <b>102</b> is interfaced to an external network (such as the Public Switched Telephone Network) through a telephone interface <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The geographic coverage area of the wireless communication system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is divided into regions or cells, which are individually serviced by the base stations <b>202</b>, <b>203</b>, and <b>204</b> (also referred to herein as cell servers). A wireless device operating within the wireless communication system selects a particular cell server as its primary interface for receive and transmit operations within the system. For example, wireless device <b>106</b> has cell server <b>202</b> as its primary cell server, and wireless device <b>108</b> has cell server <b>204</b> as its primary cell server. Preferably, a wireless device selects a cell server that provides the best communication interface into the wireless communication system. Ordinarily, this will depend on the signal quality of communication signals between a wireless device and a particular cell server.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As a wireless device moves between various geographic locations in the coverage area, a hand-off or hand-over may be necessary to another cell server, which will then function as the primary cell server. A wireless device monitors communication signals from base stations servicing neighboring cells to determine the most appropriate new server for hand-off purposes. Besides monitoring the quality of a transmitted signal from a neighboring cell server, the wireless device also monitors the transmitted color code information associated with the transmitted signal to quickly identify which neighbor cell server is the source of the transmitted signal.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a conventional wireless device for a wireless communication system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a more detailed block diagram of a wireless device described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a wireless device <b>106</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In one embodiment of the present invention, the wireless device <b>106</b> is a two-way radio capable of receiving and transmitting radio frequency signals over a communication channel under a communications protocol such as CDMA, FDMA, CDMA, GPRS or GSM. The wireless device <b>106</b> operates under the control of a controller <b>302</b> which switches the wireless device <b>106</b> between receive and transmit modes. In receive mode, the controller <b>302</b> couples an antenna <b>316</b> through a transmit/receive switch <b>314</b> to a receiver <b>304</b>. The receiver <b>304</b> decodes the received signals and provides those decoded signals to the controller <b>302</b>. In transmit mode, the controller <b>302</b> couples the antenna <b>316</b>, through the switch <b>314</b>, to a transmitter <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The controller <b>302</b> operates the transmitter and receiver according to instructions stored in memory <b>310</b>. The stored instructions include a neighbor cell measurement scheduling algorithm. Memory <b>310</b> is Flash memory, other non-volatile memory, random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM) or the like. A timer module <b>311</b> provides timing information to the controller <b>302</b> to keep track of timed events. Further, the controller <b>302</b> can utilize the time information from the timer module <b>311</b> to keep track of scheduling for neighbor cell server transmissions and transmitted color code information.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When a neighbor cell measurement is scheduled, the receiver <b>304</b>, under the control of the controller <b>302</b>, monitors neighbor cell servers and receives a &#x201c;received signal quality indicator&#x201d; (RSQI). RSQI circuit <b>308</b> generates RSQI signals representing the signal quality of the signals transmitted by each monitored cell server. Each RSQI signal is converted to digital information by an analog-to-digital converter <b>306</b> and provided as input to the controller <b>302</b>. Using the color code information and the associated received signal quality indicator, the wireless device <b>106</b> determines the most appropriate neighbor cell server to use as a primary cell server when hand-off is necessary.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">C. The Hall Effect</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an embodiment of the present inventions the exemplary wireless device <b>400</b> detects the placement of the exemplary wireless device <b>400</b> into the holster <b>500</b> by means of a detector in the exemplary wireless device <b>400</b>. The detector works in conjunction with a magnet that is connected or integrated with the holster <b>500</b>. When the exemplary wireless device <b>400</b> is placed into the holster <b>500</b>, the detector detects the proximity of the magnet in the holster <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an embodiment of the present invention, the magnet used in the holster <b>500</b> is a small (a few millimeters in length and width) ferrous metal that exhibits a magnetic field of about 0.1 Tesla. The magnet may be integrally formed with the holster <b>500</b> or detachably coupled to the outside of the holster <b>500</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows exemplary locations <b>520</b>, <b>522</b> and <b>524</b> for the magnet in the holster <b>500</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows corresponding exemplary locations <b>420</b>, <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> for the detector in the exemplary wireless device <b>400</b>. The detector may be integrally formed with the exemplary wireless device <b>400</b> or detachably coupled to the outside of the exemplary wireless device <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an embodiment of the present invention, the detector used in the holster is any detector useful for detecting a magnet field, such as a reed switch, a Hall effect sensor or a circular conducting element. A Hall effect sensor, for example, utilizes a semiconductor to sense a proximal magnetic field. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an illustration of a semiconductor <b>700</b> for use in a Hall effect sensor. When an electric current <b>702</b> flows through the semiconductor <b>700</b> in a magnetic field (exhibiting magnetic flux line <b>704</b>), the magnetic field exerts a transverse force on the moving charge carriers, the force tending to push the charge carriers to one side of the semiconductor <b>700</b>. This is most evident in a thin flat semiconductor <b>700</b>, as illustrated. A buildup of charge at the sides of the semiconductor <b>700</b> will balance this magnetic influence, producing a measurable voltage between the two sides of the semiconductor <b>700</b>. The presence of this measurable transverse voltage <b>706</b> is called the Hall effect after E. H. Hall, who discovered it in 1879.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The function of a Hall effect sensor is based on the physical principle of the Hall effect. A Hall effect sensor measures voltage <b>706</b> generated transversely to the current flow direction <b>702</b> in the semiconductor <b>700</b>, if a magnetic field <b>704</b> is applied perpendicularly to the semiconductor <b>700</b>. As the Hall effect is most pronounced in semiconductors, the most suitable Hall element is a small platelet made of semiconductive material (i.e., the semiconductor <b>700</b>). The Hall effect sensor detects the components of the magnetic flux <b>704</b> perpendicular to the surface of the semiconductor <b>700</b> and emits a proportional electrical signal, which is processed in the exemplary wireless device <b>400</b>. Thus, as the magnet in the holster <b>500</b> is placed within a proximity of the detector in the exemplary wireless device <b>400</b>, the detector in the exemplary wireless device <b>400</b> detects the presence of the magnet in the holster <b>500</b> near the exemplary wireless device <b>400</b>.</p>

The wireless device <b>106</b> can also be configured such that the wireless device <b>106</b> vibrates when an incoming call is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Another example of a setting of the wireless device <b>106</b> is the battery setting. The wireless device <b>106</b> can be configured such that the wireless device <b>106</b> operates in different battery modes, such as normal battery mode and battery save mode, in different situations. In battery save mode, the wireless device <b>106</b> is configured such that the wireless device <b>106</b> performs battery save tasks such as turning off the backlight of the view screen of the wireless device <b>106</b> or powering down certain electrical components of the wireless device <b>106</b>. In normal battery mode, the wireless device <b>106</b> is configured such that the wireless device <b>106</b> operates normally without attempting to save battery power.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Another example of a setting of the wireless device <b>106</b> is the input pad setting. The wireless device <b>106</b> can be configured such that the input pad of the wireless device <b>106</b> is either enabled or disabled. When the input pad of the wireless device <b>106</b> is enabled, the wireless device <b>106</b> is configured such that information can be entered into the wireless device <b>106</b> via the input pad.

When the use of the wireless device <b>106</b> is disabled or locked, the wireless device <b>106</b> is configured such that the wireless device <b>106</b> cannot be used for any function.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an embodiment of the present invention, the operational flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> depicts the process, on a wireless device <b>106</b>, of configuring settings of wireless device <b>106</b> based on the placement (or non-placement of) of the wireless device <b>106</b> within a holster, such as holster <b>500</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is described below with reference to the above embodiment. The operational flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> begins with step <b>802</b> and flows directly to step <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In step <b>804</b>, the wireless device <b>106</b> is currently in a state, such as the in-holster state and the out-of-holster state. In step <b>806</b>, the state of the wireless device <b>106</b> changes. That is, the wireless device <b>106</b> is either removed from the holster <b>500</b> or inserted into the holster <b>500</b>. In step <b>808</b>, the configuration settings of the wireless device <b>106</b> are adjusted in response to the change in state of step <b>806</b>. Settings include a variety of settings associated with the functions of the wireless device <b>106</b>. Settings are described in greater detail above.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an embodiment of the present invention, in step <b>808</b>, a group of settings are adjusted to a first sequence if the wireless device <b>106</b> is placed in the holster <b>500</b> in step <b>806</b>. The following section describes the first sequence of settings.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">First, the ring setting of the wireless device <b>106</b> is set to vibrate if the wireless device <b>106</b> is not externally powered. That is, the wireless device <b>106</b> does not ring when an incoming telephone call is detected. Rather, the wireless device <b>106</b> vibrates to notify the user that an incoming call is detected. This setting is only adjusted if the wireless device <b>106</b> is not externally powered, i.e., when the wireless device <b>106</b> is not connected to a charger or other device for providing an electrical current to the wireless device <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Second, the battery setting of the wireless device <b>106</b> is set to battery save mode. This setting enables the wireless device <b>106</b> to perform battery save tasks such as turning off the backlight of the view screen of the wireless device <b>106</b> or powering down certain electrical components of the wireless device <b>106</b>. Third, the input pad of the wireless device <b>106</b> is locked or disabled. This setting disables the input pad such that information can no longer be entered into the input pad. Fourth, the device use setting of the wireless device <b>106</b> is enabled. That is, the wireless device <b>106</b> is currently able to be utilized by the user in a normal fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In an embodiment of the present invention, in step <b>808</b>, a group of settings are adjusted to a second sequence if the wireless device <b>106</b> is removed from the holster <b>500</b> in step <b>806</b>. The following section describes the second sequence of settings.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">First, the ring setting of the wireless device <b>106</b> is set to ring. That is, the wireless device <b>106</b> rings when an incoming telephone call is detected. Second, the battery setting of the wireless device <b>106</b> is set to normal mode. This setting allows the wireless device <b>106</b> to perform tasks normally without having to perform battery save tasks such as turning off the backlight of the view screen of the wireless device <b>106</b> or powering down certain electrical components of the wireless device <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Third, the input pad of the wireless device <b>106</b> is unlocked or enabled. This setting enables the input pad such that information can be entered into the input pad. Fourth, the device use setting of the wireless device <b>106</b> is set to be disabled after a time period. That is, after the wireless device <b>106</b> has been removed from the holster <b>500</b> for a set period of time, the wireless device <b>106</b> is disabled such that it can no longer be used for any functions. The wireless device <b>106</b> can be removed from the disabled device use setting if the user inserts the wireless device <b>106</b> into the holster <b>500</b> or inputs a code or password into the input pad of the wireless device <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In step <b>810</b>, the control of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> returns to step <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The configuration of the ring setting is beneficial when the wireless device <b>106</b> is in the holster <b>500</b> because it allows a user to avoid loud and/or disruptive ringing. When the wireless device <b>106</b> is in the holster <b>500</b>, there is no need for the device to ring due to the proximity of the wireless device <b>106</b> to the user. Thus, the vibration of the wireless device <b>106</b> notifies the user of an incoming call.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The configuration of the ring setting is also advantageous because it eliminates the repeated adjustment of the ring setting by a user when he enters into situation when a ring is not appropriate, such as in a movie theater or a place of worship. The configuration of the ring setting is further advantageous because it reduces the number of missed calls due to the removal of a wireless device <b>106</b> from a user's person when the wireless device <b>106</b> is set to vibrate. Users often miss calls when the wireless device <b>106</b> is not attached to a user and the wireless device <b>106</b> is set to vibrate. The present invention configures the wireless device <b>106</b> to ring when it is removed from the holster <b>500</b>, thereby allowing the user to hear the wireless device <b>106</b> when it receives an incoming call.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The configuration of the battery setting is beneficial when the wireless device <b>106</b> is in the holster <b>500</b> because it saves battery life and allows for longer use of the wireless device <b>106</b> between charges. When the wireless device <b>106</b> is in the holster <b>500</b>, there is no need for certain tasks or operations to continue, such as the backlight of the view screen of the wireless device <b>106</b>. The present invention configures the battery setting of the wireless device <b>106</b> to battery save mode when it is inserted into the holster <b>500</b>, thereby saving battery life.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The configuration of the input pad setting is beneficial when the wireless device <b>106</b> is in the holster <b>500</b> because it eliminates the accidental entry of information via the input pad when the wireless device <b>106</b> is not in use. When the wireless device <b>106</b> is in the holster <b>500</b>, there is no need for allowing the input of information into the wireless device <b>106</b> via the input pad. The present invention configures the input pad setting of the wireless device <b>106</b> to be disabled when it is inserted into the holster <b>500</b>, thereby preventing accidental entry of information.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The configuration of the device use setting is beneficial when the wireless device <b>106</b> has been removed from the holster <b>500</b> for a set period of time because it prevents the unauthorized use of the wireless device <b>106</b> by others. When the wireless device <b>106</b> has been removed from the holster <b>500</b> for a set period of time without use, the present invention configures the device use setting of the wireless device <b>106</b> to be disabled. This security feature prevents the unauthorized use of the wireless device <b>106</b> when it has been removed from the holster <b>500</b> and is not in the possession of the user.</p>
