<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a new form of <i>Sedum telephium </i>plant named &#x2018;Beka&#x2019;. A naturally occurring sport or mutation of <i>Sedum telephium </i>&#x2018;Lajos&#x2019; U.S. Plant Pat. No. 14,421 characterized by a thin green edge and chartreuse yellow center to the foliage, compared to yellow edged green centered foliage of <i>Sedum telephium </i>&#x2018;Lajos&#x2019;. The parent plant, <i>Sedum telephium </i>&#x2018;Lajos&#x2019; is a sport of <i>Sedum telephium </i>&#x2018;Autumn Joy&#x2019; of hybrid origin between <i>Sedum telephium </i>and <i>Sedum spectabile. </i>The new plant was found as a sport by the inventor on a plant of <i>Sedum telephium </i>&#x2018;Lajos&#x2019; at a garden in Spring Grove, Ill. in 2000. The selection of this plant was due to its' variegated foliage. Asexual, vegetative tip cutting propagation and division has been the means of reproduction. Propagation has taken place at Intrinsic Perennial Gardens, Inc. Hebron, Ill. since 2001. The new <i>Sedum </i>has shown to be stable and identical in reproduction to the parent after rooting over 400 vegetative tip cuttings from 2002 to 2005.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart. The new <i>Sedum telephium </i>plant named &#x2018;Beka&#x2019; has shown the characteristic of a thin green edge and chartreuse yellow center to the foliage on a tall upright <i>Sedum </i>to be unique and stable. Plants of the new <i>Sedum </i>can be compared to plants of <i>Sedum alboroseum </i>&#x2018;Clown&#x2019; unpatented also known as &#x2018;Medio-Variegatum&#x2019;. 1. The new <i>Sedum </i>is a sport occurring on a hybrid with telephium while the &#x2018;Clown&#x2019; species is alboroseum. 2. The new <i>Sedum </i>has a thinner green edge, typically a 2-3 mm wide edge to the leaf while &#x2018;Clown&#x2019; has a broader variegation, typically 4-5 mm wide. 3. The new <i>Sedum </i>flower as a whole has a reddish purple flower color 187 D while &#x2018;Clown&#x2019; has a white flower with hints of pink.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Plants of the new <i>Sedum </i>can also be compared to its' parent plant of <i>Sedum telephium </i>&#x2018;Lajos&#x2019;. 1. The new sedum has a thin green edge color 137 A and a chartreuse yellow center color 146 C compared to the yellow edged foliage color 11 C and green center color 137 A.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a fuel container used with a fuel cell, a method for supplying fuel to a fuel cell, a method for filling the fuel container with fuel, and a fuel cell system, and particularly relates to a fuel cell system applicable to portable devices and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, with fuel storage devices and chemical reactors making up fuel cells, a fuel cell unit (modular unit) is formed with a fuel cell integrally combined with the surrounding electric equipment, mounting members, etc., such that the fuel cell unit as a whole is assembled into the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, a proposal has been made to include a controller in the fuel cell unit for controlling the fuel cell unit. The fuel cell controller is equipped with memory, and stores the temperature, voltage, electric current state, cell capacity, and other like information of the fuel cell unit, in the memory. As of recent, realization of applying fuel cells as the power source for portable devices, such as cameras, PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), cellular telephones, for example, is imminent.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, while carrying an extra power source for a portable device as a spare is quite conceivable, in the case of using a fuel cell for the power source of portable devices, carrying an integral module which is inseparable from the related equipment as a spare power source as described above is impractical from the perspective of portability.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, conventional arrangements do not enable management information of the fuel cell itself to be obtained or monitored.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed to a fuel cartridge and fuel cell system with excellent portability in applications to portable devices.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is also directed to a method for supplying fuel to a fuel cell, a method for filling the fuel container with fuel, and a fuel cell system, whereby information of the entire fuel cell system can be readily managed, having excellent operability, and wherein handling mistakes can be prevented to enable safe use.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first aspect of the present invention, a fuel container includes: a fuel tank adapted to store fuel to be supplied to the fuel cell of the main device; and a storage unit configured to store information, including information on type of fuel, information on remaining amount of fuel in the fuel tank, and information on number of times the fuel tank has been used wherein the fuel container is formed separately from the fuel cell of a main device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the fuel container further includes: a connection portion detachably connected to the main device; a supply port facilitating supplying the fuel from the fuel tank to the fuel cell; and a communication unit wirelessly communicating the information to the main device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the fuel container further includes an inlet having a first portion adapted to connect to the supply port, and a second portion configured to inject the fuel into the fuel tank.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a second aspect of the present invention, a method of supplying fuel to a main device having a fuel cell mounted thereto includes: a step of connecting a fuel container storing fuel to the main device having the fuel cell; a step of wirelessly communicating, between the main device and the fuel container, information of at least one of type of fuel, remaining amount of fuel in the fuel tank, and number of times the fuel tank has been used; and a step of determining whether to supply the fuel from the fuel container to the fuel cell based on the information wirelessly communicated in the wireless communication step.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Supplying of the fuel to the fuel cell may be permitted in the event that determination is made in the determining step that the type of the fuel is acceptable to the main device side, or supplying of the fuel to the fuel cell may be permitted in the event that the main device side determines in the determining step that the amount of fuel remaining in the fuel tank is a predetermined amount or more, or further, supplying of the fuel to the fuel cell may be permitted in the event that the main device side determines in the determining step that the number of times of usage of the fuel tank is a predetermined number or less.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The information may include identification information of the fuel tank and identification information of the fuel cell. In another embodiment, the method further includes a step for determining whether to supply the fuel from the fuel container to the fuel cell based on the identification information of both the fuel tank and the fuel cell.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the connecting step includes a step of connecting a plurality of fuel cartridges, in at least one of parallel and serial with respect to each other, to the main device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a third aspect of the present invention, a fuel filling method includes: a step for connecting a fuel cartridge storing fuel to a fuel filling main unit to which a fuel for filling is loaded; a step for performing wireless communication between the fuel filling main unit and the fuel cartridge regarding information of at least one of type of fuel, remaining amount of fuel in the fuel tank, and number of times the fuel tank has been used; and a step of determining, by the fuel filling main unit, whether to fill the fuel cartridge with the fuel for filling based on the information communicated in the wireless communication step.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Filling of the fuel to the fuel cartridge may be permitted in the event that determination is made in the determining step that the type of the fuel is acceptable to the fuel filling main unit side, or filling of the fuel to the fuel cartridge may be permitted in the event that the fuel filling main unit side determines in the determining step that the amount of fuel remaining in the fuel cartridge is a predetermined amount, or further, filling of the fuel to the fuel cartridge may be permitted in the event that the fuel filling main unit side determines in the determining step that the number of times of usage of the fuel cartridge is a predetermined number.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The information includes identification information of the fuel cartridge and identification information of the fuel for filling. In one embodiment, the method further includes a step of determining by the fuel filling main unit whether to supply the fuel for filling to the fuel cartridge based on the identification information of the fuel cartridge and the fuel for filling.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the connecting step includes connecting a plurality of fuel cartridges to the fuel filling main unit in parallel or serially.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, a fuel cell system includes: a main device having a fuel cell mounted thereto; a fuel container separate from the fuel cell, and including a fuel tank adapted to store the fuel to be supplied to the fuel cell, a storage unit which stores information on at least one of type of fuel, remaining amount of fuel in the fuel tank, and number of times the fuel tank has been used, and a communication unit wirelessly communicating the information to the main device; and a control unit which controls supply of the fuel from the fuel container to the fuel cell based on the information.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The above configuration realizes a fuel cell system with excellent portability for application to portable devices and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As one advantage thereof, non-contact communication between the fuel cartridge side and the main device side prevents ignition due to static electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As another advantage thereof, providing the information storage unit to the fuel cartridge which can be connected to the fuel cell enables the fuel cartridge side of the fuel container to store information relating to the container (remaining amount, number of times filled, fuel used, etc.). Confirming this information of the fuel cartridge at the main unit device side can prevent mistaken use of inappropriate fuel, mounting of different-type or non-conforming fuel cartridges, and use of fuel cartridges beyond the stipulated lifetime thereof. Also, confirming the information of the state of the fuel cartridge at the main device side enables information processing according to the type of fuel cell the fuel cartridge is combined with.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As a further advantage thereof, necessary voltage and electric energy can be obtained by connecting the fuel cartridges either serially or in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p>

Wireless communication is communication which is performed using spatial propagation of information instead of connecting the two communicating devices with cables or the like, and includes, for example, airwaves, light (particularly infrared), sound, magnetic field, and so forth. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;non-contact communication&#x201d; means that there is no electrical connection between the two communicating units, and does not necessarily mean that the two communicating units are not in physical contact.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An example of such a fuel cartridge communication unit <b>106</b> is an ISO/IEC 10536 compliant non-contact RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tag, and IC card, or the like, with electric power being supplied to the memory <b>104</b> and capacity and pressure sensor <b>107</b>. A container connecting unit <b>110</b> is a unit for mechanically connecting and detaching the fuel channel of the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> and the fuel channel of a main device. A fuel cutoff unit <b>112</b> is a unit for supplying or cutting off fuel from the fuel tank <b>111</b> to the fuel cell <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart illustrating control procedures of the controlling microcomputer <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Upon a main device, such as an image-taking device or the like, and the fuel cartridge <b>105</b>, being connected by the container connecting unit <b>110</b>, the controlling microcomputer <b>100</b> starts up (S<b>200</b>). A connection portion (not shown) at the side of the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is connected to the container connecting unit <b>110</b>. This connection portion realizing mechanical connection of the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> to the main device, and connection of a channel for guiding fuel from the fuel tank <b>111</b> to the fuel cell <b>109</b>. In step S<b>201</b>, communication is started by the controlling microcomputer <b>100</b> between the main device communication unit <b>101</b> and the fuel container communication unit <b>106</b>. The controlling microcomputer <b>100</b> reads individual identification information from the memory <b>104</b>. The identification information is for identifying whether or not the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> can be mounted to the main device and used. Information is recorded for containers which satisfy predetermined safety regulations, such as regarding filling flammable liquids or combustible gases, to the effect that the container is a standard-compliant container.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step S<b>202</b>, determination is made regarding whether or not the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is a connection-permitted container which has been permitted to be mounted to the main device and used. In the event that the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is a connection-permitted container, the flow proceeds to step S<b>203</b>, the action of the fuel cutoff unit <b>112</b> is disabled, and fuel is supplied so as to start running the fuel cell <b>109</b>. In the event that the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is not a connection-permitted container, the flow proceeds to step S<b>205</b>, wherein the display unit <b>102</b> displays a warning, prompting the user to replace the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> with another fuel cartridge. In this case, the action of the fuel cutoff unit <b>112</b> is not disabled, and the flow stands by until the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is removed at the container connecting unit <b>110</b> (S<b>206</b>). Once the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is removed, the flow returns to the initial state in step S<b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step S<b>204</b>, the controlling microcomputer <b>100</b> reads data regarding the amount of fuel remaining in the fuel tank <b>111</b> and the pressure thereof, and data regarding the type of fuel filled therein, which is stored in the memory <b>104</b>, via the main device communication unit <b>101</b> and the fuel container communication unit <b>106</b>. The controlling microcomputer <b>100</b> then calculates the amount of time which the fuel cell can still operate, based on the data regarding the type of fuel filled (e.g., methyl alcohol), concentration (%), amount remaining (ml) and pressure (Pa), and also the voltage (V) generated at the fuel cell at the main device side and the power consumption (W) of the information recording/reproducing device. This calculated time is displayed on the display unit <b>102</b> as the amount of time which the fuel cell can be used. Further, cartridge container information may be displayed besides the time, such as the type of fuel, amount of fuel remaining within the fuel tank, the number of times which the fuel tank has been used, and so forth. In addition, the resistance and voltage values at the initial state may be stored, and periodically detected to obtain and display the information about polarization and diffusion states.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In steps S<b>207</b> and S<b>208</b>, the fuel cartridge communication unit <b>106</b> continues non-contact communication with the main device communication unit <b>101</b> until removed at the container connecting unit <b>110</b>, and the memory <b>104</b> stores the newest detected data from the capacity and pressure sensor <b>107</b>. In step S<b>209</b>, fuel is cut off by the fuel cutoff unit <b>112</b>, the fuel cell <b>109</b> stops operating, and the flow returns to the initial state in step S<b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, a temperature sensor may be provided besides the pressure sensor to detect temperature within the fuel tank, so as to detect abnormalities and improve safety.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As described above, providing memory to a fuel cartridge enables the container side to store related information within the container (amount of fuel remaining, number of times filled, fuel used, etc.) even if the fuel cartridge is replaced. Accordingly, one advantage thereof is that information processing can be performed according to the specifications (voltage generated and power consumption) of the main device including the fuel cell. Also, having no electrical connection is advantageous in avoiding igniting flammable liquids or combustible gases due to static electricity. A further advantage is that supply of fuel from unknown fuel cartridges which the main device does not permit can be prevented, since fuel is sent to the fuel cell following confirmation of connection permission between the fuel cartridge and the main device.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the internal configuration of a fuel filling device using a fuel cell system according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A controlling microcomputer (control unit) <b>300</b> performs control of a fuel filling device communication unit <b>301</b>, processing according to communication information, and display of information on a display unit <b>302</b>. The memory <b>104</b> is provided to the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> and communicates with the fuel filling device communication unit <b>301</b> via the fuel container communication unit <b>106</b>, and stores the communication information thereof and information from the capacity and pressure sensor <b>107</b>. The fuel container communication unit <b>106</b> is a combination of coil and antenna for non-contact communication with the fuel filling device communication unit <b>301</b>, using electromagnetic coupling or microwaves, with electric power being supplied to the memory <b>104</b> and the capacity and pressure sensor <b>107</b>. A container connecting unit <b>310</b> is a unit for mechanically connecting and detaching the fuel channel of the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> and the fuel channel of the fuel filling device. A fuel filling unit <b>312</b> is a unit for supplying or cutting off fuel for filling <b>309</b> to the fuel tank <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating control procedures of the controlling microcomputer <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Upon the filling device and the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> being connected by the container connecting unit <b>110</b>, the controlling microcomputer <b>300</b> starts up (S<b>400</b>). In step S<b>401</b>, communication is started by the controlling microcomputer <b>300</b> between the fuel filling device communication unit <b>301</b> and the fuel container communication unit <b>106</b>. The controlling microcomputer <b>300</b> reads individual identification information from the memory <b>104</b>. The individual identification information is for identifying whether or not the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> can be mounted to the main device and used. Information is recorded for containers which satisfy predetermined safety regulations, such as regarding filling flammable liquids or combustible gases, to the effect that the container is a standard-compliant container.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In step S<b>402</b>, determination is made regarding whether or not the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is a connection-permitted container which has been permitted to be mounted to the main device and used. In the event that the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is not a connection-permitted container, the flow proceeds to step S<b>403</b>, wherein the display unit <b>302</b> displays a warning, prompting the user to replace the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> with another fuel cartridge. In this case, the flow stands by until the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is removed (S<b>404</b>). Once the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is removed, the flow returns to the initial state in step S<b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the event that the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is a connection-permitted container, the flow proceeds to step S<b>405</b>, where the controlling microcomputer <b>300</b> reads the data regarding the type of fuel already filled in the fuel tank <b>111</b>, which is stored in the memory <b>104</b>, and in the event that the container is not empty and is filled with a predetermined amount or more capable of filling the fuel cell, determination is made regarding whether or not the fuel is the same as the fuel for filling <b>309</b> in the filling device.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the event that the type of concentration of the fuel in the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is different to that of the fuel for filling <b>309</b>, the flow proceeds to step S<b>406</b> where a warning is displayed to prompt the user to replace the fuel for filling <b>309</b>. At step S<b>407</b>, it is determined whether the fuel for filling <b>309</b> has been exchanged. In the event that the fuel for filling <b>309</b> is replaced following the warning, the flow returns to step S<b>405</b>, otherwise, the flow returns to step S<b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">No fuel is filled until one or the other of the fuel for filling <b>309</b> and the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is replaced so that the concentration and type of fuel of both are the same, or until the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is replaced with an empty cartridge <b>105</b>. In step S<b>405</b>, in the event that fuel of the same concentration and type is filled to a predetermined amount of more, the flow proceeds to step S<b>408</b>, where determination is made regarding whether or not the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> is within a number of usage times or usage period wherein refilling is permissible from the perspective of durability. In the event that the life period of the fuel cartridge <b>105</b> has expired, the flow proceeds to the processing in step S<b>409</b>, a warning is issued, and the flow proceeds to the initial state in step S<b>400</b>.

Next, the fuel filling device communication unit <b>301</b> and the container communication unit <b>106</b> communicate with each other, thereby updating usage fuel type data and the number of times of filling (S<b>411</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram illustrating another example of a fuel filling device using the fuel cell system. With the fuel filling device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the fuel for filling <b>309</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has an external container configuration, the same as with the fuel cartridge <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the event of transferring the fuel, confirmation is made that the fuel type data in the memory <b>104</b> obtained from a fuel container communication unit <b>106</b> and the fuel type data in a memory <b>1041</b> obtained from a main device second communication unit <b>3011</b> match, and in the event that these do not agree, the controlling microcomputer <b>300</b> prohibits transferring of the fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described above, providing an information storage unit to the fuel cartridge enables the container side to store related information within the container (amount of fuel remaining, number of times filled, fuel used, etc.) even if the fuel cartridge is replaced. Accordingly, one advantage thereof is that accidents wherein different types of fuel are mixed at the time of refilling the fuel cartridge can be prevented. Also, the fuel is filled after confirming the durability information of the fuel cartridge, yielding an advantage in that accidents of the container rupturing due to filling an old container with fuel can be prevented.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> are block diagrams illustrating the internal configuration of a load device using a fuel cell system as the power source thereof, according to a third embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a controlling microcomputer <b>600</b> performs non-contact communication with an IC chip <b>606</b> of fuel cartridges by a first communication unit <b>601</b> and a second communicating unit <b>602</b>. The fuel cartridges are filled with fuel from an inlet <b>607</b> of the fuel cartridge, and the fuel is stored in a fuel tank <b>608</b>. The fuel within the fuel tank <b>608</b> is discharged from a supply port <b>609</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the fuel cartridges are connected serially. While only two fuel cartridges are shown in the drawing, a greater number of fuel cartridges can be connected serially. The supply port <b>609</b> of the last fuel cartridge (left in the drawing) and the inlet <b>607</b> of the adjacent fuel cartridge are connected, so as to use as an integrated fuel cartridge. The supply port <b>609</b> of the front-most fuel cartridge (right in the drawing) is connected to the main device side inlet <b>604</b>, and fuel is supplied to a fuel cell <b>605</b>, thereby generating electricity for driving a load device <b>603</b>. In this case as well, the supply port <b>609</b> for connecting to the inlet <b>607</b> is just one, so the flow of fuel and the voltage generated remains the same, but the greater the number of fuel cartridges are connected, the more fuel the overall fuel cartridge can store, meaning that the battery can be used for a longer time.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a controlling microcomputer <b>700</b> performs non-contact communication with an IC chip <b>706</b> of fuel cartridges by a first communicating unit <b>701</b> and a second communicating unit <b>702</b>. The fuel cartridges are filled with fuel from an inlet <b>707</b> of the fuel cartridge, and the fuel is stored in a fuel tank <b>708</b>. The fuel within the fuel tank <b>708</b> is discharged from a supply port <b>709</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the fuel cartridges are connected in parallel.

The supply ports <b>709</b> of the fuel cartridges and inlets <b>704</b> and <b>710</b> on the main device side are each connected, and the flow of fuel is adjusted to a constant flow, and then the fuel is supplied to a fuel cell <b>705</b> by a flow adjuster <b>711</b>, thereby generating electricity for driving a load device <b>703</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this case, there is more than one supply port and inlet, so the flow can be made greater than with the case wherein there is only one fuel cartridge. Accordingly, the number of fuel cells <b>705</b> can be increased and the voltage generated can be increased. The greater the number of containers connected in parallel, the more fuel can be discharged at once, and accordingly the greater the load that can be handled.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, providing a fuel inlet and a fuel supply port separately on fuel cartridges enables the fuel cartridges to be arranged serially or in parallel, so that either the same amount of flow as with one fuel cartridge can be provided for a longer time, meaning the same voltage is generated for a longer time, or more fuel can be provided at once, meaning that higher voltage can be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The present invention can also be achieved by providing a storage medium storing program codes for performing the aforesaid processes to an image sensing system or apparatus, reading the program codes, by a CPU or MPU of the image sensing system or apparatus, from the storage medium, then executing the program.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this case, the program codes read from the storage medium realize the functions according to the embodiments, and the storage medium storing the program codes constitutes the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, the storage medium, such as a floppy disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magneto-optical disk, CD-ROM, CD-R, a magnetic tape, a non-volatile type memory card, and ROM, and computer network, such as LAN (local area network) and WAN (wide area network) can be used for providing the program codes.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, besides aforesaid functions according to the above embodiments are realized by executing the program codes which are read by a CPU of the image sensing system or apparatus, the present invention includes a case where an OS (operating system) or the like working on the computer performs a part or entire processes in accordance with designations of the program codes and realizes functions according to the above embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Furthermore, the present invention also includes a case where, after the program codes read from the storage medium are written in a function expansion card which is inserted into the image sensing system or apparatus or in a memory provided in a function expansion unit which is connected to the image sensing system or apparatus, CPU or the like contained in the function expansion card or unit performs a part or entire process in accordance with designations of the program codes and realizes the functions of the above embodiments.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the control of an elevator. In particular, the invention concerns a method for controlling an elevator that works without changing the torque direction, such as an elevator without counterweight, and a control system designed for applying said method. The control method of the invention is applicable for use e.g. in an elevator without counterweight having an alternating-current electric motor rotating at a relatively high speed and a gear system for adapting the speed for elevator operation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Brief Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Elevator control systems nowadays typically comprise an elevator control section and a drive section controlling the electric motor (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The elevator control section comprises traffic control TRC, to which the calls issued from different floors are directed. The drive section again typically comprises motion control MOC, speed control SPC, torque control TOC and a safety circuit SAC. The drive control section receives feedback data giving the position of the elevator car for motion control, the speed for speed control, the motor current for torque control, and safety-related control data from safety contactors, by means of which the supply of current to the motor drive can be switched off to stop at a landing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In present control systems, between the control blocks a relatively large amount of data traffic, generally serial data traffic is needed for the transmission of signals (generally in serial form). Due to this, present control systems are relatively complex. Moreover, speed control is relatively important especially in the case of elevators having a high capacity (high speed, height). By contrast, in slower elevators having a gear system with a large transmission ratio, speed control is not such a critical factor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of the present invention is to overcome the drawbacks of prior art and to achieve a new and very simple elevator control method and system especially for elevators without counterweight or corresponding elevators in which the torque direction does not change.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the control method of the invention, a speed reference is computed in the elevator control section instead of in the motor drive section, and it is converted at an early stage into a position reference (position profile), which is thus a signal controlling the motor. In this case, the motor control signal need not be in serial form, which would require e.g. two microcontrollers transmitting and receiving complicated messages, but the motor control signal may be a pulse diagram wherein it is coded e.g. by PWM or frequency modulation, which is used to control the current or voltage signal to be fed into the motor. The motor is typically a synchronous or asynchronous motor provided with permanent magnets.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the control according to the invention for controlling the motor, only position and torque control signals are transmitted between the elevator control section and the motor drive.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The features of the control method and system of the invention are presented in the claims below.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">By applying the invention, the speed control in the motor drive section can be eliminated completely and the motion control partially. In addition, the following advantages are achieved:

        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0014">due to the use of basic components, a long product life span,</li>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents a control system according to the invention for the control of a relatively slow elevator without counterweight. The elevator has an elevator motor M<b>1</b>, e.g. a discoid permanent-magnet alternating-current electric motor mounted in the elevator shaft, and its control system, which is also disposed in the elevator shaft. The control system comprises a drive section DRIVE <b>1</b> integrated in conjunction with the elevator motor M<b>1</b> and, disposed separately from the control section, an elevator control section ECO<b>1</b>, including the control of safety switches SASW<b>1</b>. Between the drive section and the control section, only two signals are transmitted in two channels: position POS<b>1</b> and torque TORQUE<b>1</b>, as will be described later on.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0024">In the control system, the traditional control of the motor drive can be omitted and the computation of the speed profile is transferred to a traffic control block provided in the elevator control section. The system works as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0025">The position reference (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>), which is obtained from motion control, is used directly to control the current or voltage signal to be fed into the motor M<b>1</b>. The position reference is a pulse diagram SPEED<b>1</b>, either frequency-coded (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>) or PWM-coded (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>), which is passed to a so-called look-up table block TABLE1, either directly (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>) or via a multiplier X<b>1</b>, to which is also fed an oscillator signal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>). From the table block is obtained directly the vector phase of the voltage or current reference vector feeding the motor M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0026">The essential feature of the invention is the use of the position reference as a channel interrupting the motion. Without the position reference, the voltage vector cannot rotate, and consequently the elevator cannot move (and will not cause a danger situation).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0027">Motion control becomes simpler, and no speed profile is needed any more. Instead, the system utilizes a position profile, which may form part of very simple traffic control. Each pulse in the position profile moves the elevator through a certain distance.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0028">As for torque control, it can be stated that, when a permanent magnet synchronous motor is used in an elevator without counterweight, there is no need to use torque control based on weighing of the load. The motion profile rotates the magnetic field of the motor, and the torque is generated automatically on the basis of the load-induced variation of the electrical angle of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0029">The elevator control section must give some sort of torque reference because the torque varies in elevators of different sizes. The reference may be based on the elevator size or on the properties of the wire ropes and motor. In addition, the reference can be adjusted based on elevator car position feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0030">One method of controlling the torque is to generate a simple V/f conversion based on the position profile. In the present invention, another channel is used between the traffic control and the motor drive (e.g. a PWM signal).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">As was already stated in connection with motion control, the safety of the motor drive is based on two channels between the traffic control and the motor drive: the position profile and the torque reference. If either of these is absent, the elevator cannot move.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">The control system of the invention requires no operating parameters on the motor drive side. The motor is controlled by only two signals: position and torque.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">Some sort of diagnostics is needed on the motor drive side as well. In this invention, diagnosing can be carried out while the elevator is stationary. The above-mentioned two channels can be used if they are bi-directional.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application hereby claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 on German patent application number DE 10 2004 057 741.2 filed Nov. 30, 2004, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention generally relates to a method for testing the quality of a detector module for an x-ray computer tomograph and/or to the use of a test gantry corresponding to the gantry of the x-ray computer tomograph.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a result of manufacturing, detector modules for a detector of an x-ray computer tomograph do not always exhibit identical imaging properties, that is to say in some circumstances they supply divergent signals when the same x-ray intensity is irradiated. When a detector is constructed by using detector modules whose properties exhibit an impermissibly high spread, this can have a negative influence on the quality of an image produced thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With regard to this, the quality of the detector modules is tested in accordance with the prior art. The detector modules are usually mounted on a detector device. This is a frame of generally arcuate design and having a multiplicity of juxtaposed slots for connecting the detector modules. With regard to the quality of the detector module, it is possible to tolerate spreads of different intensity in the properties, depending on the position of a detector module on the detector device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Detector modules with a large spread in their properties are usually mounted in the vicinity of the ends of the detector device, whereas detector modules with a low spread in their properties are mounted in the middle of the detector device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with a first method according to the prior art, the detector device for holding detector modules is fitted completely with detector modules. Subsequently, the image quality that can be achieved with the detector is tested. If the image quality does not correspond to prescribed criteria, the arrangement of the detector modules is changed using the &#x201c;try and error&#x201d; principle until the desired image quality has been achieved. The known method is lengthy and requires the use of specially qualified staff. Apart from this, it is not possible to predict the time period for testing the image quality, and this disturbs the production cycle. Finally, it is possible with the aid of the known method for the quality of the detector modules used to be determined only relatively and not absolutely.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with a second method, known from DE 198 11 044 C2, the imaging properties of each detector module are tested before the production of the detector by using a special test station. The measurement results obtained in this case are then used with the aid of a special selection method to allocate the detector modules installation positions on the detector device. The provision of a special test station is costly. Moreover, there is a need, in turn, for specially trained staff to operate the special test station.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of at least one embodiment of the invention to reduce or even eliminate at least one of the disadvantages according to the prior art. One aim of at least one embodiment, for example, is to specify a method that is simple and accurate, and to specify a method for testing the quality of detector modules for x-ray computer tomographs. According to a further aim of at least one embodiment of the invention, the intention is also thereby, inter alia, to enable an absolute determination of the quality of the tested detector module.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to at least one embodiment of the invention, a method for testing the quality of a detector module for an x-ray computer tomography having the following steps is provided:</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">providing a measuring device including an x-ray source and a holding device which is equipped with at least one reference detector module and has at least one free space for inserting the detector module to be tested,</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">inserting the detector module to be tested into the free space,</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">irradiating a prescribed x-ray intensity distribution onto a detector comprising the reference detector module and the detector module to be tested,</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">measuring the reference signals supplied by the reference detector module, and measuring the test signals supplied by the detector module to be tested, and</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">evaluating the supplied signals.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The proposed method can be carried out relatively easily. It is particularly exact and timesaving. No specially experienced or trained expert staff are required. It is thereby possible, in particular, to acquire the suitability of the detector module for a specific installation position in the detector with reference to the x-ray source. There is no need to provide a special test station.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An absolute determination of the quality of the detector modules is possible as a consequence of the proposed use of reference detector modules. Defective detector modules can be identified at an early stage and rejected. A holding device in the meaning of the present invention is to be understood as including a frame or a carrier for holding the detector modules. It can be, for example, a frame that is bent in a &#x3c6;-direction and serves as a component of a gantry of an x-ray computer tomograph. A reference detector module in the meaning of the present invention is understood to include a detector module whose properties correspond to defined prescribed criteria. These are selected detector modules that exhibit only slight deviations with regard to prescribed specified properties.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a particularly advantageous refinement of at least one embodiment, a test gantry corresponding to the gantry of the x-ray computer tomograph is used as a measuring device. It is thereby possible to keep the outlay on testing the quality of the detector modules particularly low. A mass-produced gantry can be used as measuring device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, it is possible to use an electronic test device corresponding to the electronic device of the x-ray computer tomograph for measuring and processing the signals. The detector modules are therefore tested in the same system environment as when being used in the detector of the x-ray computer tomograph. The results obtained for the quality of the detector modules are particularly exact. It is possible, for example, to use as measuring device and electronic device a test x-ray computer tomograph corresponding to the x-ray computer tomograph. All that is required is to provide a special software for operating the electronic device or the hardware of the test x-ray computer tomograph.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a further refinement of at least one embodiment, the detector module to be tested is inserted between two reference detector modules. It is also possible to insert a number of detector modules between two reference detector modules in each case. A particularly exact measurement is possible given that the detector module(s) to be tested is/are held in each case between two reference detector modules. It is possible here, in particular, to determine the quality of the detector module when there is a dependence between the x-ray intensity and the spectral composition of the x radiation in a &#x3c6;-direction.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to further simplify the method the holding device is not rotated during the measurement. It is thereby possible to dispense with fastening the detector element to be tested in a special way by means of fastening elements such as screws. It suffices simply to plug the detector element into a plug-in connector provided on the holding device, and thereby to produce a connection with the downstream electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">At least one of the following reference parameters is advantageously determined from the reference signals: spectral linearity, signal drift, signal strength, persistence, temperature drift, z-gradient, current linearity. Particularly when a number of reference detector modules are used, the reference parameter can be determined by averaging. The averaging can be performed, for example, by interpolation or second or third degree. It is possible thereby to correct deviations in the signals supplied by the reference detectors or in the reference parameters resulting therefrom. However, the averaging can also be performed by another mathematical combination of a multiplicity of reference signals.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A test parameter corresponding to the reference parameter can be determined from the test signals. The evaluation can be performed by normalizing the test signals by using the reference signals and/or by normalizing the test parameters by use of the reference parameters corresponding thereto. This enables an absolute determination of the quality of the detector modules in a simple way.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a further refinement of at least one embodiment of the method, each normalized test signal and/or test parameter is assigned a value range. This enables the detector modules to be rejected and/or classified as a function of the quality determined. A tested detector module can be rejected when at least one of the normalized test signals and/or test parameters is outside the value range provided therefore. It is expedient for this purpose to take account of all the acquired normalized test signals and/or test parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The unrejected detector modules can be classified with the aid of prescribed classification rules. It suffices to test a subset of the normalized test signals and/or test parameters. Using only a prescribed subset for classification contributes to speeding up at least one embodiment of the method. The classification of the detector modules can be performed, for example, by allocating each tested detector module a preferred installation position on the holding device. The classification can be performed using conventional classification methods such as are known, for example, from DE 198 11 044 C1, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a further measure of at least one embodiment of the invention, it is provided to use test gantry, which corresponds to the gantry of an x-ray computer tomograph and is provided with at least one reference detector module, as measuring device for testing the quality of detector modules for the x-ray computer tomograph. The proposed use renders the provision of a special test station superfluous. It is possible to have recourse to a component of the x-ray computer tomograph that is mass-produced and therefore available at a relatively favorable price. There is no need to design and produce a special test station.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a particularly advantageous refinement of the use, an electronic test device corresponding to the electronic device of the x-ray computer tomograph is used for measuring and processing the signals supplied by the detector module to be tested. The proposed refinement can be implemented, for example, by using an x-ray computer tomograph that corresponds in terms of its design and hardware implementation to the x-ray computer tomograph for which the detector modules to be tested are provided.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An arcuately designed holding device <b>1</b> with a multiplicity of slots <b>2</b> (shown schematically here) for plugging in and connecting detector modules is provided in the figure. Specific slots <b>2</b> are fitted with reference detector modules <b>3</b>. An x-ray source <b>4</b> is provided opposite the detector device <b>1</b>. An x-ray fan emanating therefrom is denoted by the reference numeral <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The apparatus shown is a test gantry G that, apart from the fitting of the detector device <b>1</b> with reference detector modules <b>3</b> or detector modules to be tested, is identical in construction to the gantry of the x-ray computer tomograph. A drive, usually provided thereon, for rotating the measuring device, formed from the detector D and the x-ray source <b>4</b> in a &#x3c6;-direction can be omitted. The reference numeral <b>6</b> schematically denotes an electronic test device downstream of the detector G. This is expediently the hardware of an x-ray computer tomograph that is identical in construction to an x-ray computer tomograph for which the detector modules to be tested are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The apparatus shown is used as follows for testing the quality of the detector modules:</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The detector device <b>1</b> is fitted at the slots <b>2</b> with the detector modules to be tested (not shown in the figure). The detector D is subsequently irradiated with the aid of the x-ray source <b>4</b> with a prescribed x-ray intensity. The irradiation can be performed repeatedly for a prescribed time period.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The reference and test signals produced by the reference detector modules <b>2</b> and the detector modules are evaluated with the aid of the downstream electronic test device <b>6</b>. For this purpose, a suitable software is used to determine the following reference parameters from the measured reference signals: spectral linearity, signal drift, signal strength, persistence, temperature drift, z-gradient. The reference parameters can be determined by averaging.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The test parameters are normalized for each detector module by using the transmitted reference parameters, formed by averaging, if appropriate. The normalized test parameters form absolute values with the aid of which the quality of the detector modules can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Subsequently, the normalized test parameters are used as a basis for classifying the detector modules, in a way known from DE 198 11 044 C1, for example. In the process, each detector module is allocated a preferred installation position on the holding device. The determined values are stored in a database. A suitable program can be used for automatically specifying a set of detector modules for constructing a detector, each detector module being allocated an installation position on the holding device of the detector D.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Example embodiments being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the present invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to mechanical engineering and may be used in high-pressure low pulsation reversible machines, able to operate both as a motor and a pump. Gaseous and liquid working fluids are applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In known adjustable rotary machine (UK 2207953), the rotor is mounted within the housing containing inlet and outlet openings. The rotor has the slots containing radially sliding valves. The pump comprises of a mechanism for positioning the valves in the rotor slots, a working chamber, and a regulating member movable in radial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Taken as the closest prior-art a high-pressure low pulsations reversible adjustable pump (RU 2123602) comprises housing with inlet and outlet openings, and a rotor mounted inside the housing. The rotor has the slots for the valves which are able to reciprocate along the rotor rotation axis. (Further, instead of the term &#x201c;valve&#x201d; the more common one &#x201c;displacer&#x201d; will be used). The pump comprises mechanism mounted in the housing providing for axial positioning of the displacers in the rotor slots, a working chamber, and a partition which, together with the rotor, separates the suction and pumping spaces, thus preventing back flow of the working fluid between them. This partition is actually the one of the insulating members preventing back flow of the working fluid between the pump cavities, and a special case of one of the partitions, since any pump of this design has at least two partitions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this pump the working chamber is bounded in axial direction on one side by the surface of the rotor flank which has a sliding contact with the partition and is called the first flank of the rotor and on the other side by the regulating member which actually is a movable insulating member namely the second partition mounted opposite to the first flank of the rotor and moving axially.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Rotor pumps of this design always have two distinguishable groups of members, which simultaneously rotate relative to one another with equal values of the angular velocity and in opposite directions around their common axis. Usually they distinguish one by one basic member in each group and these two members rotating relatively to one another cause rotation of the rest of the pump elements. One of these basic members is usually called the rotor and the other one relative to which the rotation is viewed is called the stator (or also often it is called the housing).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The terms &#x201c;rotor member&#x201d; and &#x201c;stator member&#x201d; (hereinafter &#x201c;rotor&#x201d; and &#x201c;stator&#x201d;) are relative and depend only on which member is viewed as rotating relative to the other one. It should be noted that all rotations are viewed (unless something else is mentioned) relative to the common axis of rotation and the axial direction means that one is parallel to this common axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the rotor starts to rotate relative to the stator, the assembly of the pump members kinematically tied to the rotor starts rotating as well. The combination of these members and the rotor itself will hereinafter be called the rotor unit. The rest of the pump members which do not rotate together with the rotor relative to the stator and the stator itself will hereinafter be called the stator unit. I's always possible to distinguish the assembly of parts forming the pump working chamber in the rotor unit and the stator unit. The working chamber comprises of a suction space and a pumping space, and the members which are the working parts of the pump that directly do the work of delivering the working fluid from the suction space to the pumping space can also be distinguished in the rotor unit and the stator unit. The suction and pumping spaces are the working spaces of a pump (which are connected correspondingly to the inlet and outlet ports). In the aforementioned pumps when the rotor unit and the stator unit do one revolution of their mutual rotation the working parts of these units do rotational movements as well, together with the above mentioned units, besides the working parts of one of these units also do the cyclic movements along their common axis of rotation per every revolution of this unit and together with the working parts of the second unit (other unit) which do not do such cyclic movements.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The pump unit in which the members that are the working parts do also the cyclic movements along the common axis of rotation per every revolution of the rotor will hereinafter be called the rotor unit and accordingly, the basic member of it will be called the rotor. The rest of the unit will hereinafter be called the stator unit and accordingly the basic member of it will be called the stator.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It should be noted that rotation of the rotor will be always viewed relative to the stator, no matter what device the stator is mounted on to provide rotation of the rotor relative to the stator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In many practical cases of the present invention usage, the pump member called the stator may be mounted on a rotating shaft of a certain device, whereas the pump member called the rotor may be mounted on a frame or another rotating shaft of the same device. Hereinafter all rotations of the rotor will be viewed relative to the stator in accordance with the above mentioned meanings of these terms. The working parts which rotate with the rotor and directly do the work of delivering the working fluid to the pumping space of the pump are usually called displacers (hereinafter we will use this term), and the members of the stator unit which together with the members of the rotor unit which separate the suction space from the pumping space are called partitions (hereinafter we will use this term). In adjustable types of pumps one of the partitions is usually mounted so that it can move relative to the rotor and is called the regulating member. The suction space is connected to the inlet port and the pumping space is connected to the outlet port. The pumps with one cycle of the displacers' movement per one revolution of the rotor always have at least two partitions which separate the suction space from the pumping space. Two cycle pumps have twice the number of partitions, three cycle pumps have three times the number of partitions, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The difference between the distances from the rotor to the flanks of the partitions faced to the rotor determines the delivery per one rotor revolution for this type of pump (in other words the axial distance between the flanks of the partitions faced to the rotor determines the delivery per one rotor revolution for these pumps).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When chosen as the prior-art rotary machine operates as a pump it is not possible to reverse the direction of working fluid delivery without reversing the rotor rotation direction. When it operates as a hydraulic motor it is also not allowing reversing the rotor rotation direction without reversing the direction of working fluid delivery.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The object of the present invention is to widen the range of functionality for such rotary machines and to improve their operating parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This problem has been solved by the design of the rotary machine which comprises the combination of the members of a stator unit and a rotor unit, namely it has a stator, a rotor with slots in which the displacers capable of moving along the axis of the rotor rotation are located, a mechanism for setting the axial mutual disposition of the displacers, a working chamber bounded in axial direction by the first flank of the rotor and including a suction space and a pumping space, a partition mounted on the stator opposite the first flank of the rotor and a regulating member mounted on the stator opposite the first flank of the rotor (in the same place) movable axially; accordingly to the present invention the rotary machine has an additional working chamber bounded axially by the second flank of the rotor and comprising of its own suction space and pumping space (the flanks of the displacers extend to these spaces), a partition and a regulating member mounted both on the stator opposite the second flank of the rotor, the regulating member is mounted so that it can move axially, besides the regulating member is positioned so that its flank perpendicular to the axis of the rotor rotation is located opposite to the perpendicular to the axis of the rotor rotation flank of the partition, which is mounted on the stator opposite the first flank of the rotor and the partition mounted opposite the second flank of the rotor is mounted so that its flank perpendicular to the rotor rotation axis is located opposite the perpendicular to the rotor rotation axis flank of the regulating member which is mounted on the stator opposite the first flank of the rotor and the regulating members are tied to one another via a rigid kinematic joint so that the movement of one regulating member causes the other regulating member to move, moreover the working spaces of both working chambers located axially opposite one another are connected between themselves by the channel and a mechanism for setting the axial mutual position of the displacers is designed so that it insures sliding contact of each regulating member with at least one displacer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Introducing the above mentioned features to the rotary machine makes it possible to reverse the direction of working fluid delivery without reversing the rotor rotation direction and without using any special switch apparatuses when the machine operates as a pump. When it operates as a hydraulic motor it is possible to reverse the rotor rotation direction without reversing the direction of working fluid delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover the effort required to apply the regulating members to control the rotor machine does not depend any more on the working pressure in the system and the variations of the pressure in the system caused by irregular load of the pump do not transmit through the working fluid to the mechanism of the displacers axial positioning and to the delivery regulating unit. This allows to depart from a hydraulic actuator in the regulating unit and to decrease the control time of the rotary machine. Such mutual positioning of the regulating members and the partitions allows for this type of the rotary machines to reverse the direction of working fluid delivery by using just one set of displacers, one mechanism for setting their axial mutual position and to have the rotor completely balanced from the working fluid pressure forces acting on the rotor flanks.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Besides that in the particular embodiment of a rotary machine in order to unload the rotor from radial pressure forces of the working fluid, and to diminish radial vibrations of the rotor and the noise caused by them as well as to diminish the fluid friction on the walls bounding the working chamber radially both working chambers may be bounded radially by the surfaces of the annular grooves provided in the opposite flanks of the rotor so that they pass through the channels in the rotor, wherein the displacers are located and the said channels form recesses in the inner surfaces of the annular grooves by intersecting them.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In other words the annular grooves are disposed at the rotor flanks so that they pass through the rotor bores wherein the displacers are located and the radial width of the annular cylindrical grooves is less than the width of the displacers. The bottom of the first annular groove is actually the first flank of the rotor and the bottom of the second groove is the second flank of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The combination of all the above mentioned features introduced into a rotor machine widens its functionality, namely: it allows to reverse the direction of working fluid delivery with invariable direction of the rotor rotation when this rotary machine operates as a pump; to reverse the direction of the rotor rotation under fixed direction of the working fluid delivery when this rotary machine operates as a hydraulic motor; to increase the control speed, to get a constant regulating effort independently of the working pressure in the system, to simplify the design, and to increase essentially the resistance with respect to abrupt pressure jumps in the system which the machine is connected to.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In common with the other types of rotary machines this machine may have a multi-chamber design with several working cycles of the displacers per one rotor revolution.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The rotary machine of the present invention embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) comprises of housing (stator) <b>1</b> with end closures <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. Rotor <b>5</b> is mounted on shaft <b>4</b> within housing <b>1</b>. Bores <b>6</b> are made through rotor <b>5</b> wherein axially movable displacers <b>7</b> are located.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The flank of rotor <b>5</b> which is opposite end closure <b>2</b> and called the first flank of rotor <b>5</b> has annular groove <b>8</b> passed through bores <b>6</b>. Also the flank of rotor <b>5</b> opposite end closure <b>3</b> has a similar annular groove <b>9</b> which is made so that it passes through bores <b>6</b> as well. The annular grooves <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> are made so that bores <b>6</b> form recesses <b>10</b> in their inner cylindrical surfaces. The rotor machine comprises partition <b>11</b> mounted on end closure <b>2</b> opposite the first flank of rotor <b>5</b> and axially movable regulating member <b>12</b> mounted on the same end closure <b>2</b> opposite the same flank of rotor <b>5</b>. The flank of partition <b>11</b> is in sliding contact with the bottom of annular groove <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">This annular groove <b>8</b> together with end closure <b>2</b> bounds the first working chamber. Partition <b>11</b> and regulating member <b>12</b> divide this working chamber into suction space <b>13</b> and pumping space <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Suction space <b>13</b> is connected to inlet port <b>15</b> and pumping space <b>14</b> is connected correspondingly to outlet port <b>16</b>. The said rotary machine has partition <b>17</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) mounted on end closure <b>3</b> opposite the second flank of rotor <b>5</b> and axially movable regulating member <b>18</b> mounted on the same end closure <b>3</b> opposite the same flank of rotor <b>5</b>. The flank of partition <b>17</b> is in sliding contact with the bottom of annular groove <b>9</b>. This annular groove <b>9</b> together with end closure <b>3</b> bounds the additional working chamber. Partition <b>17</b> and regulating member <b>18</b> divide the additional working chamber into suction space <b>19</b> and pumping space <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Partition <b>17</b> is mounted so that its flank facing the second flank of rotor <b>5</b> is located opposite the flank of regulating member <b>12</b> mounted opposite the first flank of rotor <b>5</b>. And regulating member <b>18</b> is mounted so that its flank facing the second flank of rotor <b>5</b> is located opposite the flank of partition <b>11</b> which is opposite the first flank of rotor <b>5</b>. Suction space <b>19</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the additional working chamber is connected via channel <b>21</b> to pumping space <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the first working chamber and pumping space <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is connected via channel <b>22</b> to suction space <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). These slots pass through housing <b>1</b> but in the general embodiment of the present invention they can be made in the rotor and in the displacers but it is important that the slots connect the opposite chambers of the rotary machine.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The rotary machine comprises the mechanism positioning the displacers <b>7</b> axially which is made so, that it ensures sliding contact between at least one of the displacers and each of regulating members <b>12</b> and <b>18</b>. The mechanism for positioning the displacers axially is made by a hollow cylinder surrounding rotor <b>5</b> and mounted so that it can move axially. On the inner surface of this hollow cylinder closed curved groove <b>24</b> is made so that its curvature defines the axial mutual position of displacers <b>7</b>. Besides that each displacer <b>7</b> is supplied with follower <b>25</b>. These followers <b>25</b> enter closed curved groove <b>24</b>. Closed curved groove <b>24</b> is made so that at least one of displacers <b>7</b> disposed opposite the flank of regulating member <b>12</b> is in contact with the flank of the regulating member <b>12</b> and at least one of displacers <b>7</b> disposed opposite the flank of regulating member <b>18</b> is in contact with the flank of regulating member <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Moreover regulating members <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> and hollow cylinder <b>23</b> are tied via pull stud <b>26</b> so that the axial movement of pull stud <b>26</b> causes similar movement of regulating members <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> as well as hollow cylinder <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The rotary machine used as a pump functions the following way.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At start pull stud <b>26</b> is positioned so that regulating member <b>12</b> and regulating member <b>18</b> are disposed at equal distances from the flanks of rotor <b>5</b> which they are opposite and hollow cylinder <b>23</b> is also at the midposition. For this purpose pull stud <b>26</b> is tied to them as required.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When rotor <b>5</b> starts to rotate followers <b>25</b> of displacers <b>7</b> begin to slide over the surfaces of closed curved groove <b>24</b> and displacers <b>7</b> begin to reciprocate along the axis of the rotor rotation. Closed curved groove <b>24</b> is made so that the movement of each displacer <b>7</b> per one revolution of rotor <b>5</b> is characterized by the following cycle: displacer <b>7</b> having at the start point sliding contact with the flank of regulating member <b>12</b> begins to slide over its flank towards partition <b>11</b> separating at the same time suction space <b>13</b> from pumping space <b>14</b> in the first working chamber. With further rotation of rotor <b>5</b> at a certain moment displacer <b>7</b> starts to go into rotor <b>5</b> and stops separating suction space <b>13</b> from pumping space <b>14</b> i.e. loosing its sliding contact with regulating member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">But displacer <b>7</b> which is next to it at the same time slides over the flank of regulating member <b>9</b> separating suction space <b>13</b> from pumping space <b>14</b>. The working fluid confined between two neighboring displacers <b>7</b> and also inside slots <b>6</b> wherein these displacers <b>7</b> are located, starts moving from suction space <b>13</b> to pumping space <b>14</b> which displacers <b>7</b> come to when rotor <b>5</b> rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With further rotation of rotor <b>5</b>, displacer <b>7</b> passes over partition <b>11</b> and again begins to come to regulating member <b>12</b>. Then at some moment displacer <b>7</b> again touches the flank of regulating member <b>12</b> with its own flank and begins to slide over this flank separating suction space <b>13</b> from pumping space <b>14</b> as at the start moment.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The work cycle in the additional working chamber is almost the same, with the only difference being that displacer <b>7</b> which is in sliding contact with regulating member <b>12</b> passes over partition <b>17</b> at the same moment and then when displacer <b>7</b> passes over partition <b>11</b> it is a sliding contact with regulating member <b>18</b> separating suction space <b>19</b> from pumping space <b>20</b>. Suction space <b>19</b> of the additional working chamber at the same time is opposite pumping space <b>14</b> of the first working chamber and pumping space <b>20</b> is correspondingly opposite suction space <b>13</b>. Since suction space <b>19</b> is connected via channel <b>21</b> to pumping space <b>14</b> and pumping space <b>20</b> is connected via channel <b>22</b> to suction space <b>13</b> and regulating members <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> are at the midposition there is no working fluid flow through inlet port <b>12</b> and outlet port <b>16</b>. This occurs because the amount of working fluid going into pumping space <b>14</b> is equal to the amount of working fluid going out off suction space <b>19</b> (these spaces are connected via channel <b>21</b>) and the amount of working fluid going out of suction space <b>13</b> is equal to the amount of working fluid going into pumping space <b>20</b> (these spaces are connected via channel <b>22</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When regulating member <b>12</b> is shifted by pull stud <b>26</b> to the end of its range from rotor <b>5</b>, hollow cylinder <b>23</b> and regulating member <b>18</b> also move in the same direction. Displacers <b>7</b> being in sliding contact with the flank of regulating member <b>12</b> slide out from rotor <b>5</b> to the same axial extent as regulating member <b>12</b> and displacers <b>7</b> being in sliding contact with the flank of regulating member <b>18</b> correspondingly slide into rotor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The working fluid delivery to pumping space <b>14</b> from suction space <b>13</b> increases and the intake of working fluid from suction space <b>19</b> and its flow to pumping space <b>20</b> decreases, therefore the working fluid starts pumping into outlet port <b>16</b> and flowing out of inlet port <b>15</b>. In order to reverse the direction of the working fluid flow in the rotary machine pull stud <b>26</b> must be shifted to the other extreme position where regulating member <b>18</b> is furthermost from rotor <b>5</b>. When regulating member <b>18</b> is in this position the direction of the working fluid flow is reversed and the working fluid starts pumping now into port <b>15</b> and flowing out of port <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should be noted that when regulating members <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> are in these extreme positions the rotary machine works with maximum delivery and different directions of the working fluid pumping. When regulating members <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> approach the midposition, delivery of the rotary machine reduces to zero and begins to increase again when regulating members <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> pass over the midposition but at the same time the direction of working fluid pumping reverses.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since the working chambers located in the same axial direction opposite each other are connected to each other via the channels the working pressures in them are equal and the pressure forces acting on rotor <b>5</b> from these working chambers are completely balanced. When the rotary machine operates as a hydraulic motor it is possible to change both speed and direction of rotor <b>5</b> rotation by the positioning of pull stud <b>26</b> similar to other reversible rotary machines.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to an electric distribution box in which female-female terminals for electrically and mechanically connecting connection terminals of bus bars, distribution parts, etc., are received and supported in a case or a plate such as a board.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In many electric connection equipments of the type in which high voltage is dealt with within a limited space, electric wiring within the equipment is formed by installing strip-like bus bars. One example of such equipments is an electric distribution box.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, in a hybrid car, an electric car, a fuel cell car or the like, a battery, an ignition switch, an inverter, etc,. are provided via this electric distribution box, and an electromagnetic relay is operated based on an output signal from the ignition switch, and main power is transmitted to the inverter while a voltage sensor detects the condition of the battery (see, for example, JP-A-2004-282908 (Page 1, FIG. 1)).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One example of the construction of such electric distribution box will be described. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the electric distribution box comprises a lower case z<b>1</b> having distribution part-receiving portions (not shown) respectively receiving distribution parts (such as fuses, an electromagnetic relay and a pressure sensor) and recess portions z<b>2</b>, bus bars z<b>4</b> each installed on the lower case z<b>1</b> and having a connection terminal z<b>5</b> received in an upstanding manner within the corresponding recess portion z<b>2</b>, female-female terminals z<b>3</b> which are completely received within the respective recess portions z<b>2</b>, and grip the respective connection terminals z<b>5</b>, and an upper case z<b>6</b> which is detachably fitted on the lower case z<b>1</b>, and has external connection terminal-inserting holes z<b>7</b> for the passage of external connection terminals of the distribution parts, etc., therethrough. As described above, for example, main power is transmitted to the inverter or the like by the ON/OFF operation of the ignition switch.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the related electric distribution box, the upper case z<b>6</b> is fitted on the lower case z<b>1</b> having the female-female terminals completely received with the respective recess portions z<b>2</b> as described, and therefore the following problems have been encountered.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Namely, there are occasions when the external connection terminal-inserting hole z<b>7</b> and the corresponding female-female terminal z<b>3</b> are slightly displaced out of registry with each other from some cause, so that the external connection terminal can not be easily inserted into the female-female terminal z<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, when the upper case is caused to strike against a working table or the like, the external connection terminal-inserting hole z<b>7</b> and the corresponding female-female terminal z<b>3</b> are slightly displaced out of registry with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In such a case, the worker again carefully inserted the external connection terminal into the female-female terminal, and therefore there has been room for further improvement.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">And besides, the side surfaces of the related female-female terminal are flat, and therefore there are occasions when the female-female terminal is inserted in a wrongly-oriented manner into the recess portion. In this case, the external connection terminal-inserting hole and a holding portion of the corresponding female-female terminal are completely displaced out of registry with each other, so that the external connection terminal, in some cases, has failed to be connected to the female-female terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there has been proposed an electric distribution box in which external connection terminal-inserting holes z<b>10</b> for the passage of external connection terminals of distribution parts, etc., therethrough are formed in an upper case z<b>9</b>, and recess portions z<b>11</b> for respectively receiving female-female terminals z<b>3</b> are formed on this upper case in surrounding relation respectively to the peripheries of the holes z<b>10</b>, thereby preventing a holding portion of the female-female terminal z<b>3</b>, received in each recess portion z<b>11</b>, from being brought out of registry with the corresponding external connection terminal-inserting hole z<b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the above electric distribution box, although the misregistration of the holding portion of each female-female terminal z<b>3</b> relative to the external connection terminal-inserting hole z<b>10</b> can be prevented, the following problem is encountered.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Namely, an upper surface of a lower case on which a plurality of bus bars are installed is flat, and therefore the shortest distance (that is, the creeping distance measured along an insulating surface) between the two conducting members, that is, each female-to-female terminal z<b>3</b> and each of those bus bars (other than the bus bar to which this female-female terminal z<b>3</b> is connected) disposed near to this female-female terminal z<b>3</b>, becomes smaller as compared with the related structure in which the recess portions are formed on the upper surface of the lower case, and as a result a problem has arises with the insulating performance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is therefore an object of this invention to provide an electric distribution box in which each external connection terminal-inserting hole is prevented from being disposed out of registry with a corresponding female-female terminal while securing a sufficient creeping distance between the female-female terminal and each of nearby bus bars, and besides wrong insertion of the female-female terminal into a recess portion is prevented, thereby enhancing the connecting reliability of external connection terminals.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A preferred embodiment of an electric distribution box of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The electric distribution box of this embodiment is used as an automotive part. A battery, an ignition switch, an inverter, etc., are provided via the electric distribution box, and an electromagnetic relay is operated based on an output signal from the ignition switch, and main power is transmitted to the inverter while a voltage sensor detects the condition of the battery, and the functions of the electric distribution box are well known. In the drawings, reference numeral <b>1</b> denotes female-female terminals, reference numeral <b>2</b> denotes a lower case, reference numeral <b>3</b> denotes bus bars, and reference numeral <b>4</b> denotes an upper case.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The electric distribution box A of this embodiment includes the female-female terminals <b>1</b>, the lower case <b>2</b>, and the upper case <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The female-female terminal <b>1</b> is formed of an electrically-conductive metallic material. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the female-female terminal <b>1</b> includes a frame body <b>11</b> (having a generally rectangular shape when viewed from the top) having an overlapping portion formed at one corner portion thereof. One side wall of the frame body <b>11</b> is bent back downwardly at an upper portion of the frame body <b>11</b>, and is further is bent back upwardly at a lower portion of the frame body <b>11</b> to thereby form a strip-like resilient piece portion <b>12</b> having generally U-shaped upper and lower portions. The female-female terminal <b>1</b> has a pair of holding portions <b>1</b><i>a </i>formed respectively between one of the opposite side walls of the frame body <b>11</b> and the resilient piece portion <b>12</b> and between the other side wall of the frame body <b>11</b> and the resilient piece portion <b>12</b>. A connection terminal <b>31</b> of the bus bar <b>3</b> (The bus bars <b>3</b> form circuits of the electric distribution box A) is inserted into one of the two holding portions <b>1</b><i>a </i>from the lower side, while a connection terminal <b>31</b>&#x2032; of a distribution part or an external equipment is inserted into the other holding portion <b>1</b><i>a </i>from the upper side.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The frame body <b>11</b> has the overlapping portion formed at the one corner portion thereof (that is, at an upper left corner portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the overlapping portion defining a convex portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each of the bus bars <b>3</b> is formed by blanking a strip-like member from an electrically-conductive metal sheet (such as a copper sheet) by a pressing machine or the like so that a desired wiring pattern can be provided, and then if necessary, a desired portion of the blanked portion is bent to form the connection terminal <b>31</b> for connection to the female-female terminal <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The bus bars <b>3</b> are installed on the lower case <b>2</b> in such a manner that the connection terminals <b>31</b> (each formed by bending the end portion of the bus bar <b>3</b> upwardly) project upwardly. The lower case <b>2</b> has first recess portions <b>21</b> and distribution part-receiving portions (not shown) formed on an upper surface of the lower case <b>2</b>. The first recess portions <b>21</b> receive the respective female-female terminals <b>1</b> each gripping the connection terminal <b>31</b>, and the distribution part-receiving portions receives the respective distribution parts (such as fuses, an electromagnetic relay and a pressure sensor) forming the electric circuits of the electric distribution box A. Engagement portions <b>24</b> for engagement with respective retaining portions <b>43</b> of the upper case <b>4</b> (described later) are formed on side surfaces of the lower case <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, each first recess portion <b>21</b> has a generally rectangular shape when viewed from the top, and has an open portion <b>22</b> for installing the bus bar <b>3</b>. A projecting portion <b>25</b> is formed within the first recess portion <b>21</b>, and is disposed close to the open portion <b>22</b>. The projecting portion <b>25</b> supports the female-female terminal <b>1</b> in such a manner that the female-female terminal <b>1</b> is spaced upwardly from a bus bar installation surface <b>23</b> formed on the upper surface of the lower case <b>2</b>, and also the projecting portion <b>25</b> abuts against the bus bar <b>3</b> to thereby guide the connection terminal <b>31</b> upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first recess portion <b>21</b> (having the generally rectangular shape when viewed from the top) has an inserting direction-limiting portion <b>26</b> (into which the convex portion <b>13</b> of the female-female terminal <b>1</b> is inserted) formed in an inner side surface thereof, and this inserting direction-limiting portion <b>26</b> serves to prevent wrong insertion of the female-female terminal <b>1</b> into the first recess portion <b>21</b></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first recess portion <b>21</b> is formed into such a predetermined depth that a generally upper half portion of the female-female terminal <b>1</b> projects outwardly from the first recess portion <b>21</b> when the female-female terminal <b>1</b> is received in the first recess portion <b>21</b>. Also, the inner periphery of the first recess portion <b>21</b> has such a predetermined size that the female-female terminal <b>1</b> can be inserted and fitted thereinto.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Thanks to the provision of the first recess portions <b>21</b>, a sufficient creeping distance is secured between each female-female terminal <b>1</b> and each of the nearby bus bars (that is, those bus bars other than the bus bar to which this female-female terminal <b>1</b> is connected), thereby securing a satisfactory insulating performance.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Second recess portions <b>41</b> for respectively receiving the generally upper half portions of the female-female terminals <b>1</b> are formed in a lower surface of the upper case <b>4</b>. External connection terminal-inserting holes <b>42</b> for the passage of the downwardly-extending external connection terminals <b>31</b>&#x2032; of the distribution parts and external equipments therethrough are formed respectively in predetermined portions of the upper case <b>4</b>. The retaining portions <b>43</b> for engagement with the respective engagement portions <b>24</b> of the lower case <b>2</b> are formed on side surfaces of the upper case <b>4</b> so that the upper case <b>4</b> can be detachably engaged with the lower case <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A second inserting direction-limiting portion <b>44</b> is formed within each second recess portion <b>41</b> so as to be continuous with the corresponding inserting direction-limiting portion <b>26</b> formed at the lower case <b>2</b>, and the female-female terminal <b>1</b> can be inserted into this limiting portion <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, a procedure of assembling the electric distribution box A of this embodiment, having the above construction, will be described. First, the distribution parts are received respectively in the distribution part-receiving portions (not shown) of the lower case <b>2</b>, and the bus bars <b>3</b> are installed on the bus bar installation surface <b>23</b>, thereby forming the desired circuits on the lower case <b>2</b>. At this time, the connection terminal <b>31</b> of the bus bar <b>3</b> is brought into abutting engagement with the projecting portion <b>25</b> of the first recess portion <b>21</b>, thereby positioning the connection terminal <b>31</b> received in a projecting manner within the first recess portion <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Then, while confirming the orientation of the female-female terminal <b>1</b> so that its convex portion <b>13</b> can be engaged in the inserting direction-limiting portion <b>26</b>, each female-female terminal <b>1</b> is inserted the corresponding first recess portion <b>21</b> (in which the connection terminal <b>31</b> of the bus bar <b>3</b> is received in a projecting manner) until the female-female terminal <b>1</b> is brought into abutting engagement with the projecting portion <b>25</b>. At this time, the connection terminal <b>31</b> of the bus bar <b>3</b> is fitted in the holding portion <b>1</b><i>a, </i>and the female-female terminal <b>1</b> is received in the first recess portion <b>21</b>. This received condition is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, the upper case <b>4</b> is fitted on the lower case <b>4</b> in such a manner that the retaining portions <b>43</b> of the upper case <b>4</b> are engaged respectively with the engagement portions <b>24</b> of the lower case <b>2</b>. At this time, the generally upper half portion of the female-female terminal <b>1</b> is received in the second recess portion <b>41</b> in such a manner that the generally upper half portion of the convex portion <b>13</b> of the female-female terminal <b>1</b> is engaged in the second inserting direction-limiting portion <b>44</b> formed within the second recess portion <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Then, the external connection terminals <b>31</b>&#x2032; of the distribution parts and external equipments are passed respectively through the external connection terminal-inserting holes <b>42</b> formed in the upper case <b>4</b>, and as a result each of these external connection terminal <b>31</b>&#x2032; is inserted into the other holding portion <b>1</b><i>a </i>opposed to the holding portion <b>1</b><i>a </i>in which the connection terminal <b>31</b> of the bus bar <b>3</b> is fitted. Therefore, the external connection terminals <b>31</b>&#x2032; of the distribution parts and external equipments are electrically connected to the respective connection terminals <b>31</b> of the bus bars <b>3</b> via the respective female-female terminals <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described above, in the electric distribution box A of this embodiment, the first recess portions <b>21</b> for respectively receiving the generally lower half portions of the female-female terminals <b>1</b> are formed on the lower case <b>2</b>, while the second recess portions <b>41</b> for respectively receiving the generally upper half portions of the female-female terminals <b>1</b> are formed at the upper case <b>4</b>. The female-female terminals <b>1</b> are held by the upper case <b>4</b> and the lower case <b>2</b>, thereby eliminating a fear that the external connection terminal-inserting holes <b>42</b> are disposed out of registry with the respective female-female terminals <b>1</b>, and at the same time the sufficient creeping distance is secured, thereby positively insulating each female-female terminal <b>1</b> from the nearby bus bars.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">And besides, the convex portion <b>13</b> is formed on the female-female terminal <b>1</b>, and the inserting direction-limiting portions <b>26</b> and the second inserting direction-limiting portions <b>44</b> (in which the convex portions <b>13</b> can be engaged) are formed in the lower case <b>2</b> and the upper case <b>4</b> so as to limit the inserting direction of each female-female terminal <b>1</b>, thereby preventing the wrong insertion of the female-female terminal <b>1</b> into the first and second recess portions <b>21</b> and <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although the electric distribution box A of this embodiment has been described above, this electric distribution box is merely one example of preferred embodiments of the invention, and therefore the invention is not limited to the above embodiment, and various modifications can be made without departing from the subject matter of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, in the above embodiment, although the convex portion <b>13</b> is defined by the overlapping portion formed at the one corner portion of the frame body <b>11</b> (that is, the upper left corner portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the shape and disposition of the convex portion are arbitrary and are not limited in so far as it can limit the inserting direction of the female-female terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Although the invention has been illustrated and described for the particular preferred embodiments, it is apparent to a person skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made on the basis of the teachings of the invention. It is apparent that such changes and modifications are within the spirit, scope, and intention of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The present application is based on Japan Patent Application No. 2005-117654 filed on Apr. 15, 2005, the contents of which are incorporated herein for reference.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, cigar lighter plugs of the type improved in removability from and insertability into a socket are known as a plug removable from and insertable into a cigar lighter socket of a motor vehicle. It is disclosed by, for example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication Nos. 10-326648, 10-199629, and 2000-30814. The plugs disclosed in the three patent publications each have a construction incorporating a technique that enables removal from and insertion into sockets having inside diameters different from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, electrical appliances, such as TV receiver sets and refrigerators, for being used with power supplied through a cigar lighter plug of a motor vehicle are pervasive, and hence there is a tendency towards increase of power consumption. As such, especially in an environment, such as in the summer season, in which the temperature rises in the vehicle cabin interior, the plug inserted into the cigar lighter socket is heated to an abnormally high temperature, and a part of a housing is melted thereby in a worst case.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various embodiments according to the invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. In general, according to one embodiment of the invention, a plug removable from and insertable into a cigar lighter socket includes a plug body; a first contact provided to a lead end of the plug body; a second contact extended externally from a peripheral surface of the plug body and coupled to a second lead wire; a slender fuse provided in the plug body and including one of contact terminals that is brought into contact with the first contact; a fixed electrode fixedly provided in the plug body and coupled to a first lead wire; a spring provided in a compressed state between the fixed electrode and the other one of the contact terminals of the fuse; a conductive member that is deformable and electrically short-circuits between the other one of the contact terminals of the fuse and the fixed electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The embodiments of the invention will be described in detail herebelow with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exterior view showing a major-portion of a plug equipped cord <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partially enlarged schematic view showing an interior construction of a plug <b>10</b>. The plug equipped cord <b>1</b> (or, the plug <b>10</b>) is removable from or insertable into a cigar lighter socket (not shown) of a motor vehicle. The plug equipped cord <b>1</b> is used to supply power from the cigar lighter socket to electrical appliances, such as a TV receiver set and a refrigerator.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the plug equipped cord <b>1</b> (or, the plug <b>10</b>) includes a plug body <b>2</b> having a substantially cylindrical shape and formed of an insulation material, such as plastic. A contact pin <b>3</b> (corresponding to the first contact) having the electro-conductivity is retractably provided on the side of the lead end along removal/insertion direction (arrow direction) with respect to the cigar lighter socket of the plug body <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the contact pin <b>3</b> is inserted from the inner side to be slidable with respect to an opening <b>2</b><i>a </i>provided to the lead end of the plug body <b>2</b>, and is prevented by a fall-out prevention structure (not shown) from falling out. Two lead wires <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are connected to a rear end side of the plug body <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Two contact springs <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>(second contacts) each formed of a metal plate outwardly arcuate are provided on the peripheral surface of the plug body <b>2</b>. The two contact springs <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>are disposed substantially symmetric with respect to a center axis of the plug body <b>2</b>. The contact springs <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>work to cause pressure against the inner wall of the cigar lighter socket in the event of removing/inserting the plug body <b>2</b> to/from the cigar lighter socket. More specifically, clamping forces are generated by the spring forces of the contact springs <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>between the plug body <b>2</b> and the socket, and the contact springs <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>are electrically conductive to the inner wall of the socket. The lead wire <b>12</b>, which is one (second lead wire) of the two lead wires, is soldered and thereby connected to an end portion of the contact spring <b>4</b><i>b</i>, which is one of the contact springs.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a slender fuse <b>5</b> having a substantially cylindrical shape and including contact terminals <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>at both ends is replaceably mounted in the plug body <b>2</b>. In this event, the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>a </i>located at one end portion of the fuse <b>5</b> is abutted against the rear end of the contact pin <b>3</b>, and then the fuse <b>5</b> is compressed towards the contact pin <b>3</b> by a compression spring <b>6</b> (described below) disposed on a side spaced apart from the contact pin <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A metallic fixed base <b>7</b> fixedly mounted to the plug body <b>2</b> is provided on the rear end side of the fuse <b>5</b> spaced apart from the contact pin <b>3</b> in the plug body <b>2</b>. The fixed base <b>7</b> functions as a fixed electrode of the invention, and is soldered and thereby connected to the lead wire <b>11</b> (first lead wire), which is the other one of the two lead wires described above. The above-described compression spring <b>6</b> is disposed in the compressed state between the fixed base <b>7</b> and the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>provided to the rear end side of the fuse <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As such, when the plug <b>10</b> having the above-described construction is inserted into the cigar lighter socket (not shown), the contact springs <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>flex and thereby generate clamping forces for compressing the socket inner wall. Thereby, the contact pin <b>3</b>, which is located at the lead end in the removal/insertion direction, is abutted against a bottom wall (not shown) of the socket and is then pushed in. In this state, the contact pin <b>3</b> is prevented by restoring forces of the contact springs <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>from falling out of the socket of the plug body <b>2</b>. Concurrently, the contact pin <b>3</b> is compressed by restoring forces of the compression spring <b>6</b> onto the bottom wall of the socket, whereby electrical connection or coupling is secured.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partially enlarged view of a connection structure between the fixed base <b>7</b> and the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the fuse <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In general, the fuse <b>5</b> is replaceable for the plug body <b>2</b>, and simple compression contact is made between the compression spring <b>6</b> and the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>for compressing the fuse <b>5</b>. It is known that since the compression spring <b>6</b> has a coil shape, the contact resistance between the compression spring <b>6</b> and the plain contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>is relatively high, and heat is generated in that portion. In this manner, when the heat is generated at the site where the contact resistance is high, a worst case can take place in which the plug body <b>2</b> is melted by the heat. In this case, there is a probability of burning injury of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, in the event that a 14-inch wide TV set is connected to the cigar lighter socket by using the conventional plug equipped cord, the power consumption is about 70 [W]. In this case, a connection portion between the compression spring and the contact terminal of the fuse is heated to a very high temperature. As such, the probability of the burning injury by the heat is very high.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In consideration of the above, in the present embodiment, a RITZ wire <b>8</b> for electrically short-circuiting the compression spring <b>6</b> is provided between the fixed base <b>7</b> and the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the fuse <b>5</b>. The RITZ wire <b>8</b> functions as a conductive member of the invention and has a structure fabricated by interlacing a large number of slender metal wires. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the present embodiment, one end of the RITZ wire <b>8</b> is connected to an end portion on the side that is in contact with the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the fuse <b>5</b> of the compression spring <b>6</b>, and the other end thereof is fixed to a connection portion between the fixed base <b>7</b> and the lead wire <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As described above, the RITZ wire <b>8</b> has the structure fabricated by interlacing a large number of slender metal wires, such that the RITZ wire <b>8</b> is flexibly bendable, and is capable of following expansion/compression of the compression spring <b>6</b>. More specifically, in the event of removal from or insertion into the socket of the plug <b>10</b>, the RITZ wire <b>8</b> followingly deforms in the event of expansion/compression of the compression spring <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, because of the structure fabricated by interlacing a large number of metal wires, the cross-sectional area of the RITZ wire <b>8</b> can be formed to be relatively large. Thus, the RITZ wire <b>8</b> is capable of reducing electrical resistance of its own, thereby making it possible to reduce current flowing through the compression spring <b>6</b>. Consequently, the provision of the RITZ wire <b>8</b> makes it possible to significantly reduce the degree of heat generation between the compression spring <b>6</b> and the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">More specifically, the RITZ wire <b>8</b> of the present embodiment was practically connected to between the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>and the fixed base <b>7</b>, and a current of 7 [A] was continually applied and flowed therethrough. As a consequence, the contact resistance between the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the fuse <b>5</b> and the compression spring <b>6</b> was reduced to about one fifth, thereby reducing the temperature of heat by about 20&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described above, according to the present embodiment, only by the addition of the simple construction in which the RITZ wire <b>8</b> is wired between the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the fuse <b>5</b> and the fixed base <b>7</b>, heat in the contact portion between the fuse <b>5</b> and the fixed base <b>7</b> can be significantly reduced, and safety of the plug in use can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a partially enlarged view of a major portion of a plug equipped cord (or, a plug) according to a second embodiment of the present invention. A construction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is similar to the construction described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, a plug <b>10</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has a construction including, instead of the RITZ wire <b>8</b>, a metal piece <b>9</b> extending from the fixed base <b>7</b>. The other portions of the construction are identical to those of the plug <b>10</b> described above. As such, in the present case, only the different portion (that is, the metal piece <b>9</b>) will be described in more detail below, and detailed descriptions of the other portions will be omitted herefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The fixed base <b>7</b> of the plug <b>10</b>&#x2032; has the metal piece <b>9</b> integrally extending towards the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the fuse <b>5</b>. The metal piece <b>9</b> functions as the conductive member of the invention, and has a leaf spring structure causing an extensional end portion thereof to be compressed against the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the fuse <b>5</b>. In the present embodiment, the direction of compression by the metal piece <b>9</b> against the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>is the direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the fuse <b>5</b> (direction shown by the arrow F). Preferably, a surface portion of the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b </i>with which the metal piece <b>9</b> is in contact is arcuate along a peripheral surface of the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b</i>, thereby making it possible to reduce contact resistance therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">By employing the construction described above, in the event of expansion/compression of the compression spring <b>6</b>, the metal piece <b>9</b> slides along the peripheral surface of the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b</i>, whereby the expansion and compression of the compression spring <b>6</b> are not disturbed. In addition, by the compression of the lead end of the metal piece <b>9</b> against the contact terminal <b>5</b><i>b</i>, contact therebetween can be stabilized. Further, since the leaf spring structure integral with the fixed base <b>7</b> is employed as the conductive member, the fuse <b>5</b> can easily be replaced, the number of components/parts can be reduced, and the manufacturing costs can be reduced. Consequently, compared to the RITZ wire <b>8</b> of the first embodiment described above, since the time and labor for soldering both ends of the RITZ wire <b>8</b> are not necessary, the number of steps can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While certain embodiments of the inventions have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions. Indeed, the novel methods and systems described herein may be embodied in a variety of other forms; furthermore, various omissions, substitutions and changes in the form of the methods and systems described herein may be made without departing from the spirit of the inventions. The accompanying claims and their equivalents are intended to cover such forms or modifications as would fall within the scope and spirit of the inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, while the respective embodiments have been described with reference to the case where the RITZ wire <b>8</b> or the metal piece <b>9</b> is employed as the conductive member for short-circuiting the compression spring <b>6</b>, no limitations are imposed thereto. The conductive member may be of any type as long as it has an electrical resistance lower than at least the compression spring <b>6</b> and is deformable following the expansion and compression of the compression spring <b>6</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a magnetic disk to be mounted on a magnetic disk device such as a hard disk drive (HDD) or the like, or a method for manufacturing a glass substrate for a magnetic disk.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A magnetic disk is known as one of recording media for information processing equipment and is widely used for a hard disk drive (HDD). Such a magnetic disk has a substrate and a thin film such as a magnetic layer and the like on a substrate. As the substrate, an aluminum substrate has been employed. However, recently, in order to respond to the demand for increased recording density, recent tendency is that glass substrates have been widely used instead of the aluminum substrates because a spacing between the magnetic head and the magnetic disk can be narrowed in the glass substrates as compared with aluminum substrates. Also, each surface of the glass substrates is precisely polished, which makes it possible to realize high recording density and to lower a flying height of the magnetic recording head as low as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As described above, high smoothness of the magnetic disk surface is required and indispensable for lowering a flying height (flying amount) necessary for realizing high recording density. In order to obtain high smoothness of the magnetic disk surface, requirement is directed to high smoothness of the substrate surface. However, realizing high recording density on the magnetic disk has become difficult now only by simply polishing the substrate surface in high precision. That is to say, no matter how much the substrate surface is polished, high smoothness cannot be obtained when a foreign object is adhered on the substrate. Of course, removal of foreign objects has been performed conventionally, but the technology has reached a state wherein foreign objects conventionally neglected or allowed on the substrate are recognized as a problem in today's high-density requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The glass substrate having high smoothness can be obtained by fine polishing by the use of a cerium oxide polishing agent. However, after the polishing process using a cerium oxide polishing agent, foreign objects which are protruded often remain without being removed with a normal cleaning process. This results in a problem wherein the surface roughness thereof cannot be reduced. The protruded foreign objects are frequently formed by polishing abrasives remaining on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As for a technique for removing the protruded foreign objects formed by adhered cerium oxide abrasives, with the technology field of glass substrates for a information recording medium, for example, performing sulfate cleaning after polishing with cerium oxide abrasives has been proposed (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2000-348338). Further, for example, with the technology field such as information recording media, liquid crystal or organic EL displays, photo-masks, and the like, a technique for cleaning the glass substrate with cleaning chemical solution including three components of acid, reducer, and fluorine ion, has been proposed (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2004-059419).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, with hard disk drives (HDD), information recording density of 60 gigabits/inch<sup>2 </sup>is demanded. This relates to a phenomenon wherein, in addition to needs for conventional computer storage drives, hard disk drives have been mounted in cellular phones, navigation systems, digital cameras, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In such new applications, the chassis space for mounting a hard disk drive is markedly small as compared with computers, so hard disk drives need to be reduced in size. To this end, the diameter of a magnetic disk to be mounted on a hard disk drive needs to be reduced in size. For example, with computer applications, 3.5 inch or 2.5 inch magnetic disks have been able to be employed, but with the above new application, smaller diameter magnetic disks than those, such as 0.8 inch through 1.8 inch for example, are employed. Thus, even with a case of reducing magnetic disks in size, information capacity of a predetermined level or more should be increased, which accelerates augmentation of information recording density.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, in order to use a restricted disk area more effectively, hard disk drives employing an LUL (Load/Unload) method have been employed instead of hard disk drives employing the conventional CSS (Contact Start and Stop) method. With the LUL method, when a hard disk drive is stopped, the magnetic head thereof is evacuated to a tilting table called a ramp, positioned outside of the magnetic disk, and when the hard disk drive is activated, following the magnetic disk starting rotations, the magnetic head is slid on the magnetic disk from the ramp, and is subjected to flying flight to perform recording and reproduction. When the hard disk drive is stopped, the magnetic head is evacuated to the ramp outside of the magnetic disk, and then rotation of the magnetic disk is stopped. These series of movements are called LUL movements. With the magnetic disks for a hard disk drive employing the LUL method, a contact sliding region (CSS region) as to the magnetic head needs not to be provided unlike the CSS method, and a recording/reproducing region can be enlarged, which is preferable for realizing increase of information capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to improve information recording density under such a situation, spacing losses need to be infinitely reduced by decreasing the flying amount of the magnetic head. In order to achieve information recording density of 60 gigabits/inch<sup>2 </sup>or more, the flying amount of the magnetic head needs to be reduced to 10 nm or less. With the LUL method unlike the CSS method, a convex/concave shape for the CSS method needs not to be provided on the magnetic disk surface, resulting in readily realizing smoothness on the magnetic disk surface. Accordingly, with the magnetic disk employing the LUL method, the flying amount of the recording head can be further decreased as compared with that employing the CSS method, and increase in S/N ratio of recording signals can be realized, which contributes to realization of high recording capacity of the magnetic disk device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Due to further decrease of the flying amount of the magnetic head according to introduction of the recent LUL method, even with extremely low flying amount of 10 nm or less, stable movements of the magnetic disk have been demanded. However, upon the magnetic head being subjected to flying over the magnetic disk surface with such an extremely low flying amount, a problem has resulted wherein a fly-stiction frequently occurs. Fly-stiction is a malfunction wherein the flying attitude of the magnetic head suddenly becomes unstable during recording/reproducing, causing abnormal fluctuation in recording signals and reproducing signals. This fly-stiction especially readily occurs with the magnetic head which performs flying with an NPAB (negative pressure air bearing surface) slider, i.e., a negative pressure slider. The magnetic head including a negative pressure slider has an advantage wherein stable flying flight can be performed even at low flying amount of 10 nm or less, but this causes strong negative pressure upon the magnetic head undersurface (i.e., surface facing the magnetic disk). Accordingly, this makes for a situation wherein fly-stiction readily occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, with the flying amount of the magnetic head reaching 10 nm or less, with the magnetic head on which a magneto-resistance effect-type reproducing device, e.g., a TMR (tunneling magneto-resistance) type reproducing device is mounted, a problem is created in that thermal asperity readily occurs. Upon thermal asperity occurring, the error rate drastically deteriorates, and it is hard to perform recording/reproducing of information with a predetermined recording density, e.g., 60 gigabits/inch<sup>2 </sup>or more, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In light of these situations, the present inventor has attempted to develop a magnetic disk, and a glass substrate for a magnetic disk, which can perform safely recording/reproducing without crashing, fly-stiction, and thermal asperity, even in the event of the magnetic head flying within 10 nm. For example, the present inventor has attempted to remove adhered polishing agent in a precise manner, by refining polishing abrasives to perform accurate mirror polishing process, and then preparing a cleaning chemical solution in a subsequent cleaning process. For example, the present inventor has used various cleaning techniques including cleaning that utilizes the techniques of the above Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2000-348338, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2004-059419, but has found out that these problems cannot be always prevented in a sure manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention has been made to solve these problems, and a first object thereof is to provide a method for manufacturing a glass substrate for a magnetic disk particularly useful in a case of manufacturing a magnetic disk for subjecting the magnetic head to flying flight with a low flying amount such as a flying amount of 10 nm or less, or a method for manufacturing a magnetic disk using the glass substrate manufactured by the above manufacturing method.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A second object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a glass substrate for a magnetic disk particularly useful in a case of manufacturing a magnetic disk for reproducing recorded information with a magnetic head on which a magneto-resistance effect-type reproducing device, in particular, a TMR (tunneling magneto-resistance reproducing device is mounted, or a method for manufacturing a magnetic disk using the glass substrate manufactured by the above manufacturing method.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A third object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a glass substrate for a magnetic disk particularly useful in a case of manufacturing a magnetic disk to be mounted on a hard disk drive for performing starting/stopping movements using the load/unload method, or a method for manufacturing a magnetic disk using the glass substrate manufactured by the above manufacturing method.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A fourth object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a glass substrate for a magnetic disk particularly useful in a case of manufacturing a magnetic disk to be recorded/reproduced with high information recording density of 60 gigabits/inch<sup>2 </sup>or more, or a method for manufacturing a magnetic disk using the glass substrate manufactured by the above manufacturing method.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present inventor, in order to solve the above problems, has observed the surface of a glass substrate for a magnetic disk which was subjected to mirror surface polishing using a cerium oxide polishing agent, and then cleansed with a cleaning solution including acid such as sulfuric acid and the like, in detail using an atomic force microscope or an electron microscope. In particular, upon a minute rectangular region of which one side is 5 &#x3bc;m being enlarged and observed carefully, with the glass substrate surface following cleaning, the present inventor found that a small hole (recessed portion) is opened wherein the opening portion thereof is around 0.1 through 0.5 &#x3bc;m in size, and is around 6 nm through 8 nm in depth. Protruding foreign objects have not been observed on this glass substrate, so adhered polishing abrasives are assumed to have been generally removed, but a minute recessed portion has been formed. Conventionally, with a glass substrate for a magnetic disk, focus has been put on removal of protruding foreign objects which adversely affect the magnetic head to be subjected to upward flying flight. A recessed shape has not been encountered with the upper magnetic head, so this shape has not been seen as a problem at all. The present inventor has felt strongly that this recessed shape causes the above problems. This is because the present inventor has considered that the flying amount of the magnetic head further decreases as compared with the conventional flying amount, and accordingly, a recessed portion, which has not conventionally been seen as a problem, adversely affects the magnetic disk.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Consequently, the present inventor has performed research focusing on in that first, the mirror surface state of the glass substrate surface subjected to mirror surface polishing is to be maintained, second, protruding foreign objects (protruding portions) formed by a polishing agent being adhered are to be removed in a sure manner, and third, in the event that the magnetic head passes through upward with a low flying amount of 10 nm or less, opening portions (recessed portions) which adversely affects the magnetic head are not to be formed, and has completed the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to a first aspect of the present invention, a method for manufacturing a glass substrate for a magnetic disk comprises mirror polishing process and cleaning process of the glass substrate.

The polishing agent is supplied to the glass substrate and, thereafter, the surface of the glass substrate is subjected to mirror surface polishing by relatively moving a polishing cloth and the glass substrate. Subsequently, the glass substrate is brought into contact with a cleaning solution including ascorbic acid, fluorine ion, and sulfuric acid of 3% by weight or more, and the polishing agent is dissolved and removed. With the glass substrate surface after cleaning, recessed portions are not formed which adversely affect the magnetic head subjected to flying flight with a flying amount of 10 nm or less, for example while protrusions formed by the polishing agent being adhered are removed, and the glass substrate surface is also a mirror surface. This makes it possible to prevent head crashes, thermal asperity, and fly-stiction, with the magnetic disk manufactured using this glass substrate.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Description will be made below regarding an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present inventor made various kinds of cleaning reagents, compared performance of solutions as to cerium oxide (cerium dioxide) serving as a principal component of a polishing agent, and found that appropriate performance of solution can be obtained as to a processing solution including sulfuric acid and ascorbic acid. In particular, upon fluorine ion being supplied by further adding hydrofluoric acid or sodium fluoride as an additive to the processing solution including sulfuric acid and ascorbic acid, the present inventor confirmed that rapid performance of solution can be obtained. The present inventor confirmed performance of solution as to rare-earth oxide such as lanthanum oxide, praseodymium oxide, neodymium oxide, and the like other than cerium oxide, and found that the same performance of solution as that of cerium oxide can be obtained. Actually, when the present inventor subjected a glass substrate to mirror surface polishing with a polishing solution including cerium oxide polishing agent, following which cleansed the glass substrate with a cleaning solution including sulfuric acid, ascorbic acid, and fluorine ion, the present inventor was able to remove protrusions (protruding portions) formed by the polishing agent being adhered to the glass substrate regardless of the concentration of sulfuric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">However, when the present inventor observed the surface thereof in detail with an atomic force microscope, in the event of bringing the glass substrate into contact with a cleaning solution of which the concentration of sulfuric acid is lower than a predetermined concentration, the present inventor discovered that small holes (recessed portions) are opened on the glass substrate surface. Specifically, in the event that the concentration of sulfuric acid is less than 3% by weight, the present inventor found that recessed portions are formed on the glass substrate surface. With a cleaning solution belonging to a system wherein sulfuric acid, ascorbic acid, and fluorine ion coexist, in the event that the concentration of sulfuric acid is less than 3% by weight, sulfuric acid causes leaching from the glass, and roughens the surface roughness by deforming the surface thereof, which can be conceived. Note that the term &#x201c;leaching&#x201d; means a phenomenon wherein with multi-component glass such as aluminosilicate glass and the like, substance fusible to acid included in the glass is dissolved out while maintaining the skeleton portion (SiO skeleton) of the glass. Leaching is a phenomenon markedly occurring with multi-component glass including elements other than SiO. Leaching is a phenomenon different from etching wherein the glass itself is dissolved.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Accordingly, in order to solve the problems of the present invention by preventing recessed portions on the glass substrate surface from formation, the present inventor found that sulfuric acid needs to exceed at least 1.5% by weight, preferably 3% by weight or more with a cleaning solution belonged to a system wherein sulfuric acid, ascorbic acid, and fluorine ion coexist.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, when subjecting the glass substrate to cleaning using this cleaning solution, the present inventor found that the forms of protruding portions and recessed portions generated on the glass substrate differ depending on the type of cerium oxide polishing agent. Many types of cerium oxide polishing agents used for mirror surface polishing of a glass substrate exist depending on the manufacturing method thereof, and others. Also, with a cerium oxide polishing agent, cerium oxide is a principal component, but other rare-earth oxide other than cerium oxide, for example, lanthanum oxide, praseodymium oxide, neodymium oxide, and the like are included. That is to say, a cerium oxide polishing agent is a rare-earth oxide polishing agent including cerium oxide as a principal component.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At the present (as of the year 2004), cerium oxide polishing agents, which are available, are classified into two types of a cerium oxide polishing agent which is manufactured by performing processing such as baking and the like with bastnaesite ores including fluorine substance as raw materials, and a cerium oxide polishing agent which is manufactured by performing processing such as baking and the like with a refined rare-earth compound as a raw material. The former cerium oxide polishing agent principally includes fluorine in a form of rare-earth fluoride since a raw material ore itself includes fluorine substance. On the other hand, the latter cerium oxide polishing agent includes no fluorine, or includes a minute amount of fluorine even if fluorine is included. Note that the content of fluorine within a polishing agent can be measured as the content of fluorine atoms using the XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis method) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Comparison was made regarding performance of cleaning of a cleaning solution according to the present invention in a system wherein sulfuric acid (however, the concentration of sulfuric acid is 3% by weight or more), ascorbic acid, and fluorine ion coexist, as to cerium oxide polishing agents including various contents of fluorine, and the present inventor found that with a polishing agent of which content of fluorine exceeds a predetermined content, protruding portions generated on the glass substrate surface cannot be removed in a predetermined manner. With a polishing agent of which content of fluorine exceeds a predetermined content, the present inventor also found that recessed portions are formed in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">From this perspective, in the event of cleaning a glass substrate for a magnetic disk using a cleaning solution according to the present invention, the present inventor found out that a cerium oxide polishing agent (i.e., rare-earth oxide polishing agent) adhered to the surface thereof needs to include no fluorine, or include fluorine of which content is 5% by weight or less even with a fluorine polishing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With a cerium oxide polishing agent including much content of fluorine, a lot of rare-earth fluoride such as cerium fluoride is included other than rare-earth oxide such as cerium oxide. When the glass substrate is brought into contact with a cleaning solution including sulfuric acid, cerium fluoride and sulfuric acid are principally reacted to generate cerium sulfate, which can be conceived. On the other hand, a reaction for generating water and cerium sulfate by cerium oxide and sulfuric acid being reacted is performed in parallel, but moderately, the reaction for generating hydrofluoric acid and cerium sulfate by cerium fluoride and sulfuric acid being reacted is conceived to have an advantage. That is to say, in the event that a rare-earth oxide polishing agent includes fluorine exceeding a predetermined amount, solution of rare-earth oxide serving as a principal component of a polishing agent is obstructed by the reason wherein reaction is generated between rare-earth fluoride serving as an impurity and sulfuric acid, and the like. Accordingly, protruding portions generated by the polishing agent being adhered on the glass substrate are conceived not to be removed appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also, as a result of the reaction between rare-earth fluoride and sulfuric acid, hydrofluoric acid is generated within the cleaning solution, but fluorine ion concentration in the cleaning is disturbed by the generated hydrofluoric acid, and accordingly, the concentration is in danger of increase as compared with a desired concentration. Further, when hydrofluoric acid is generated in the vicinity of the interface between the polishing agent adhered to the glass substrate and the glass, the glass substrate surface is in danger of subjecting to etching (generation of a recessed portion) at a minute region by the generated hydrofluoric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With the present invention, a low fluorine polishing agent of which content of fluorine is 5% by weight is employed, whereby a glass substrate in a mirror surface shape can be manufactured without causing the above problems, and without generating protruding portions and recessed portions.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With the present invention, in the event that the concentration of sulfuric acid included in the cleaning solution of a glass substrate is set to 3% by weight, recessed shapes can be prevented from generation on the glass substrate surface, but for example, from the perspective that the dissolving rate of a polishing agent and manufacturing efficiency are desired to be improved, the concentration of sulfuric acid can be practically set to 4% by weight or more. Also, the more the concentration of sulfuric acid increases, the more manufacturing efficiency improves, but exceeding 30% by weight is not preferable since the dissolving rate of cerium oxide decreases in some cases. From this perspective, the concentration of sulfuric acid is preferably set to 30% by weight or less. Further, in the event of a fluorine cerium oxide polishing agent, as described above, reaction occurs between rare-earth fluoride and sulfuric acid, so excessively increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid is not preferable. From this perspective, the concentration of sulfuric acid is 30% by weight or less, preferably 10% by weight or less.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With the present invention, ascorbic acid included in the cleaning solution of a glass substrate may be substituted with L-ascorbic acid. This may be supplied as the salt of L-ascorbic acid. The concentration of ascorbic acid included in the cleaning solution can be adjusted within a range wherein predetermined performance of solution as to a polishing agent can be maintained, for example, the concentration of 0.1% by weight or more. In the event that the concentration is less than 1% by weight, the dissolving rate of a polishing agent is slow, and accordingly, manufacturing efficiency is deteriorated in some cases. When considering manufacturing velocity, the concentration is 0.5% by weight or more, preferably 1% by weight or more. The upper limit value of the concentration of ascorbic acid needs not to be restricted to any value, but practically 4% by weight or less is preferable. However, the vicinity of 4% by weight is close to the saturated concentration of ascorbic acid, so making up a cleaning solution is practically difficult. Accordingly, when considering manufacturing efficiency, 3% by weight or less is preferable. In the vicinity of 3% by weight, a cleaning solution is rapidly made up, thereby improving manufacturing efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With the present invention, fluorine ion included in the cleaning solution of a glass substrate is preferably supplied by adding hydrofluoric acid or sodium fluoride to the cleaning solution. In particular, employing hydrofluoric acid is preferable. The concentration of fluorine ion can be adjusted in a predetermined manner within a range wherein the operation of the present invention is obtained, but is preferably 1 ppm or more. When the concentration of fluorine ion is less than 1 ppm, the dissolving rate of the cleaning solution as to a polishing agent is slow, and accordingly, which deteriorates manufacturing efficiency, and also in some cases, dissolving performance as to the polishing agent is insufficient. From this perspective, in particular, the concentration of fluorine ion is preferably set to 3 ppm or more. Also, the upper limit value of the concentration of fluorine ion is recommended to be set to 40 ppm or less, preferably 20 ppm or less. When exceeding 40 ppm, the dissolving rate of the cleaning solution as to the polishing agent is slow, and accordingly, which deteriorates manufacturing efficiency, and also in some cases, dissolving performance as to the polishing agent is insufficient. Also, when exceeding 40 ppm, etching of the glass substrate is in danger of occurring. When etching occurs upon the glass substrate, the degree of roughness on the mirror surface polishing surface of the glass substrate increases, and also the surface of the glass substrate is in danger of formation of protruding shapes and recessed shapes thereupon.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Note that with a fluorine cerium oxide polishing agent, as described above, hydrofluoric acid is generated by the reaction between rare-earth fluoride and sulfuric acid included in the cleaning solution. Accordingly, with the present invention, the concentration of sulfuric acid needs to be managed within a ppm level. In particular, when fluorine included in the polishing agent exceeds 5% by weight, managing the concentration of fluorine ion within the cleaning solution is difficult in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">With the present invention, the polishing agent to be used for mirror surface polishing of a glass substrate is not restricted to a particular agent as long as the polishing agent of which the principal component is rare-earth oxide of which the content of fluorine is 5% by weight or less. In particular, a cerium oxide polishing agent including cerium oxide as a principal component is preferably employed. Here, the polishing agent of which the principal component is rare-earth oxide of which the content of fluorine is 5% by weight or less means a polishing agent of which a principal component is rare-earth oxide including no fluorine, or including fluorine of 5% by weight or less even with a fluorine polishing agent. Also, the term &#x201c;content of fluorine&#x201d; means the content of fluorine atoms included in the polishing agent. Fluorine atoms are included in the polishing agent as fluorine substance (fluoride and/or fluorine). In the event of including fluorine within the polishing agent, the content of fluorine is preferably set to 3% by weight or less.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The method of mirror surface polishing according to the present invention is not restricted to a particular method, for example, the surface of the glass substrate should be polished in a mirror surface shape by bringing the glass substrate into contact with polishing cloth, and moving the polishing cloth and the glass substrate relatively while supplying a polishing agent. A polishing pad can be employed as polishing cloth. A polishing pad made up of flexible polisher is preferably employed. The hardness of the polishing pad is ASKER C-type hardness, and is preferably 60 or more but 80 or less. The contact surface between the polishing pad and the glass substrate is a foamed resin wherein a foamed pore is opened, preferably foamed polyurethane. The average particle diameter of polishing abrasives (polishing abrasives of which the principal component is cerium oxide in the present invention) included in the polishing agent can be set to 0.1 &#x3bc;m or more but 1 &#x3bc;m or less. Upon polishing being performed thus, the surface of the glass substrate can be polished in a smooth mirror surface shape.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With the present invention, glass making up a glass substrate is preferably amorphous aluminosilicate glass. Such a glass substrate can be finished to a smooth mirror surface by subjecting the surface thereof to mirror surface polishing. As for such aluminosilicate glass, aluminosilicate glass (however, aluminosilicate glass excluding phosphorous acid) including SiO<sub>2 </sub>of 58% by weight or more but 75% by weight or less, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>of 5% by weight or more but 23% by weight or less, Li<sub>2</sub>O of 3% by weight or more but 10% by weight or less, and Na<sub>2</sub>O of 4% by weight or more but 13% by weight or less as principal components can be employed. For example, amorphous aluminosilicate glass including SiO<sub>2 </sub>of 62% by weight or more but 75% by weight or less, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>of 5% by weight or more but 15% by weight or less, Li<sub>2</sub>O of 4% by weight or more but 10% by weight or less, Na<sub>2</sub>O of 4% by weight or more but 12% by weight or less, and Z<sub>r</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>of 5.5% by weight or more but 16% by weight or less, as principal components, also having the ratio by weight of Na<sub>2</sub>O/ZrO<sub>2 </sub>of 0.5 or more but 2.0 or less, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/ZrO<sub>2 </sub>of 0.4 or more but 2.5 or less, but excluding phosphorous acid, can be employed. The glass excluding alkaline earth metal oxide such as CaO and MgO is preferable. An example of such glass is N5 glass (product name) manufactured by HOYA Corp.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With aluminosilicate glass, leaching sometimes occurs by coming into contact with sulfuric acid, and the surface of the glass substrate is sometimes deformed to roughen the surface roughness. The cleaning solution according to the present invention is, as described above, composed in light of these problems, and accordingly is suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With the present invention, the surface of the glass substrate following cleaning process is preferably a mirror surface of which the maximum valley depth Rv is 4 nm or less. When the Rv exceeding 4 nm, i.e., when the depth of a recessed portion is deep, the flying attitude of the magnetic head for performing flying flight with a flying amount of 10 nm or less is sometimes disturbed, and also the magnetic head is in danger of fly-stiction. Further, the mirror surface of which the maximum roughness Rmax is 6 nm or less is preferable. Such a mirror surface state can be realized by performing the mirror polishing process and cleaning process according to the present invention in this order.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With the present invention, the glass substrate is preferably subjected to chemical strengthening processing following the cleaning process according to the present invention. As for a method of the chemical strengthening processing, for example, a low temperature ion exchange method for performing ion exchange at a temperature which does not exceed the glass transition point, e.g., at temperature of 300&#xb0; C. or more but 400&#xb0; C. or less, and so forth is preferable. The term &#x201c;chemical strengthening processing&#x201d; means processing wherein ion exchange is performed between an alkali metal element having a relatively large atomic radius within chemical strengthening salt and an alkali metal element having a relatively small atomic radius within the glass substrate by bringing melted chemical strengthening salt into contact with the glass substrate, an alkali metal element having a large ion radius is infiltrated in the surface layer of the glass substrate to cause compression stress on the surface of the glass substrate. The glass substrate subjected to chemical strengthening processing excels in crashproof properties, so is particularly preferable for mounting on a mobile HDD. As for chemical strengthening salt, alkali metal nitrate such as potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, or the like can be preferably employed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With the surface of the glass substrate according to the present invention, a polishing agent is removed in a sure manner, so uniform compression stress can be brought about on the surface of the glass substrate by performing chemical strengthening processing. When the chemical strengthening processing of the glass substrate is performed without removing the polishing agent sufficiently, the polishing agent is fixed to the glass substrate during a process wherein the glass substrate is subjected to ion exchange processing at temperature of 300 degrees or more centigrade but 400 degrees or less centigrade, which cannot be moved easily. Further, the glass beneath the adhered polishing agent is prevented from generation of compression stress, and accordingly, the portion thereof may be deformed to a protruding shape or a recessed shape. The average particle diameter of the polishing agent to be employed for the mirror polishing process is 0.1 &#x3bc;m through 1 &#x3bc;m, so the shape deformation, i.e., protruding shape deformation or recessed shape deformation in size equivalent thereto is sometimes caused. With the present invention, a polishing agent can be removed in a sure manner, and also the surface of a glass substrate to be subjected to the chemical strengthening processing is a smooth surface in a mirror surface shape without protruding and recessed shapes, so uniform compression stress can be caused even at a minute region. Accordingly, even following the chemical strengthening processing, a smooth surface in a mirror surface shape without protruding and recessed shapes can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">With the present invention, tape polishing processing can be performed following the cleaning process according to the present invention. With the present invention, the surface of a glass substrate to be subjected to the tape polishing processing is a smooth surface in a mirror surface shape without protruding and recessed shapes, so the surface shape is not in danger of being disturbed by insertion of a foreign object in the tape polishing processing.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Recently, magnetic anisotropy is sometimes applied to the magnetic layer of the magnetic disk in the circumferential direction of the disk to improve the information recording density of the magnetic disk. The circumferential direction of the disk is, that is to say, the movement direction of the magnetic disk, so applying magnetic anisotropy along in this direction contributes to realization of high recording density. Texture can be formed which is made up of streaks oriented in the circumferential direction of the disk by subjecting the surface of the disk-shaped glass substrate to the tape polishing processing. When a magnetic layer is formed on the glass substrate subjected to this texture processing, magnetic anisotropy can be created in the circumferential direction of the disk. With the tape polishing processing of this texture processing, a diamond polishing agent is employed. Texture is formed on the surface of the glass substrate by bringing the polishing tape into contact with the glass substrate, supplying the diamond polishing agent, and relatively moving the polishing tape and the glass substrate. At this time, in the event that a foreign object is adhered to the surface of the glass substrate, or a protruding or recessed shape is formed, the desired texture is prevented from formation. Accordingly, applying predetermined magnetic anisotropy to the magnetic disk is difficult. With the present invention, the surface of a glass substrate is a smooth surface in a mirror surface shape without protruding and recessed shapes, so uniform texture can be formed even at a minute region. Accordingly, the present invention contributes to realization of high recording density of a magnetic disk.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The magnetic disk according to the present invention is manufactured by forming at least a magnetic layer on the glass substrate for a magnetic disk according to the present invention. As for a material of the magnetic layer, CoPt strong magnetic alloy serving as a large hexagonal system in the anisotropy magnetic field can be employed. As for a method for forming the magnetic layer, a method for forming the magnetic layer on the glass substrate can be employed using the sputtering method, for example, the DC magnetron sputtering method. Also, the orientation direction of the magnetic grain of the magnetic layer, and the size of the magnetic grain can be controlled by providing a base layer between the glass substrate and the magnetic layer. For example, the magnetic easy direction of the magnetic layer can be oriented along the magnetic disk surface by employing a cubic base layer such as Cr alloy. In this case, the magnetic disk employing the in-plane magnetic recording method is manufactured. Also, for example, the magnetic easy direction of the magnetic layer can be oriented along the normal line of the magnetic disk surface by employing a hexagonal base layer including Ru and Ti. In this case, a magnetic disk employing the vertical magnetic recording method is manufactured. The base layer can be formed using the sputtering method, as with the magnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Also, with the present invention, a protective layer and a lubricant layer are preferably formed in this order above the magnetic layer. As for the protective layer, an amorphous hydride carbonaceous protective layer is preferably employed. For example, the protective layer can be formed using the plasma CVD method. As for the film thickness of the protective layer, 30 &#x212b; through 80 &#x212b; are preferable. Also, as for the lubricant layer, a lubricant agent having a functional group at the low-end of the principal chain of a perfluoro polyether compound can be employed. In particular, a perfluoro polyether compound having a hydroxyl group at the low-end as a polar functional group is preferably employed as a principal component. The film thickness of the lubricant layer is preferably 5 &#x212b; through 15 &#x212b;. The lubricant layer can be applied and formed using the dip method.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The magnetic disk according to the present invention is preferably employed as a magnetic disk for a hard disk drive to be mounted on mobile equipment such as a cellular phone, navigation system, digital camera, and so forth. Also, the glass substrate for a magnetic disk is preferably employed as a glass substrate for a magnetic disk.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">EXAMPLES </heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Description will be made below in detail regarding a method for manufacturing a glass substrate for a magnetic disk, and a method for manufacturing a magnetic disk, with reference to examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A method for manufacturing a glass substrate for a magnetic disk according to an example 1 comprises (1) Rough grinding process, (2) End-face mirror surface polishing process, (3) Lapping process, (4) First polishing process, (5) Second polishing process (principal surface mirror surface polishing process), (6) Cleaning process (cleaning process after mirror surface polishing), and (7) Chemical strengthening process. Description will be made below in detail about each of the above-mentioned processes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">(1) Rough Grinding Process</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">First, the glass disk molded with the press method was subjected to grinding processing with a relatively rough diamond whetstone. As a glass composite serving as a material, a glass composite including SiO<sub>2 </sub>of 62% by weight or more but 75% by weight or less, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>of 5% by weight or more but 15% by weight or less, Li<sub>2</sub>O of 4% by weight or more but 10% by weight or less, Na<sub>2</sub>O of 4% by weight or more but 12% by weight or less, and ZrO<sub>2 </sub>of 5.5% by weight or more but 15% by weight or less as principal components, and also having the ratio by weight of Na<sub>2</sub>O/ZrO<sub>2 </sub>of 0.5 or more but 2.0 or less, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/ZrO<sub>2 </sub>of 0.4 or more but 2.5 or less, was employed. This glass composite is glass excluding alkali rare-earth metal oxide such as CaO and MgO. Specifically, N5 glass (product name) serving as amorphous aluminosilicate glass manufactured by HOYA Corp. was employed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, the both surfaces of the glass disk were subjected to grinding processing with a diamond whetstone of which grain size is finer than the above whetstone. Thus, the surface roughness of the glass substrate surface is finished to 10 &#x3bc;m or so with the Rmax (measured by JISB0601). Next, a hole is made in the central portion of the glass substrate in a disk shape using a cylindrical whetstone to create a donut-shaped glass substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">(2) Mirror Surface Polishing Process of an End Surface</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Next, the surface roughness of each end surface of the glass substrate was subjected to mirror surface polishing with 1 &#x3bc;m at the Rmax, and 0.3 &#x3bc;m at the Ra while rotating the glass substrate using brushing polishing. As for a polishing agent, a cerium oxide polishing agent was employed. Subsequently, the surface of the glass substrate was subjected to water cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">(3) Lapping Process</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, the glass substrate was subjected to lapping processing. This lapping process is for improving dimensional accuracy and shape accuracy. The lapping processing was performed using a lapping tool, and the grain size of abrasives was changed twice with #400 and #1000. More specifically, first, the alumina abrasives in the grain size #400 were employed, the principal surfaces of both surfaces of glass substrate stored in a carrier are subjected to lapping with surface accuracy of 0 through 1 &#x3bc;m, and surface roughness (Rmax) of 6 &#x3bc;m or so by rotating an adducent gear and an abducent gear. Next, the grain size of the alumina abrasives was changed to #1000, lapping was performed, and surface roughness (Rmax) of 2 &#x3bc;m or so was obtained. The glass substrate subjected to the lapping processing was dipped in a neutral detergent cleaning bath, and in a water cleaning bath in this order, and was subjected to cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">(4) First Polishing Process</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, the glass substrate was subjected to the first polishing process. This first polishing process is for removing scratches and deformation remaining from the above lapping process. This process was performed using a polishing apparatus. More specifically, the first polishing process was performed under the following polishing conditions using a hard polishing pad made up of polyurethane. As for a polishing agent, a cerium oxide agent was employed. The glass substrate subjected to the first polishing process was dipped in a neutral detergent cleaning bath, a deionized water cleaning bath, a deionized water cleaning bath, an IPA (isopropyl alcohol) cleaning bath, and an IPA (steam drying) cleaning bath, in this order, and was subjected to cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">(5) Second Polishing Process (Principal Surface Mirror Surface Polishing Process)</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, the second polishing process was performed by employing the same polishing apparatus employed in the first polishing process, and changing the polishing pad from the hard polishing pad to a soft polishing pad. The processing performed in this second polishing process is mirror polishing process for finishing the principal surfaces in a smooth mirror surface with the surface roughness Rmax of around 6 nm or less of the principal surfaces while maintaining the flat principal surfaces obtained in the first polishing process. The soft polishing pad of ASKAR C-type hardness 72 was employed as a polishing pad. Also, foamed polyurethane on which foamed pore is opened was employed for the surface of the polishing pad. A polishing solution wherein a cerium oxide polishing agent is dispersed in deionized water was employed. The average particle diameter of the polishing agent was 0.8 &#x3bc;m. Note that the content of fluorine included in this cerium oxide polishing agent was analyzed using the XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis method), 3% by weight at F (fluorine atoms) was obtained. The surface of the glass substrate was subjected to mirror surface polishing by supplying the polishing solution to the glass substrate, and sliding the polishing pad and the glass substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Next, the cleaning process of the glass substrate subjected to the second polishing process (mirror surface polishing process of each principal surface, namely, principal surface mirror polishing process) was performed as follows. The glass substrate subjected to the second polishing process was stored under water without drying (including sun drying), and conveyed to the next cleaning process still in a wet state. This is because once the glass substrate dries with polishing residuals remaining thereupon, removing the polishing agent is sometimes difficult in the cleaning process.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">(6) Cleaning Process (Cleaning Process After Mirror Surface Polishing, Namely, Post-Cleaning Process)</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">This cleaning process is for removing the polishing agent remaining on the surface of the glass substrate finished in a mirror surface in the mirror surface polishing process and will be called a post-cleaning process hereinafter. The polishing agent needs to be removed without roughening the glass surface finished in the mirror surface. For example, in the event that the polishing agent has etching and leaching effects on glass, the polishing agent roughens the mirror finished glass surface to change the mirror finished glass surface into a mat finished surface. The mat finished substrate cannot reduce the flying amount of the magnetic head sufficiently. Accordingly, the cleaning solution according to the present invention has neither etching nor leaching effects on glass, and is composed as a cleaning solution having selective performance of solution as to a specific polishing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">A cleaning solution including sulfuric acid of 4.5% by weight and L-ascorbic acid of 1% by weight was prepared beforehand, and hydrofluoric acid of 10 ppm was added thereto such that the fluorine ion concentration within this cleaning solution becomes 10 ppm. As described above, the cleaning solution in this cleaning process was composed. When the same cerium oxide polishing agent as that employed in the second polishing process (principal surface mirror surface polishing process) was dispersed, the polishing agent was found to be completely dissolved for around four minutes. Also, no etching or leaching problematic to glass (aluminosilicate glass) were found.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Note that with the cleaning solution made up of sulfuric acid and L-ascorbic acid without adding hydrofluoric acid, the dissolving rate of the polishing agent is slow, it takes around 20 minutes until the polishing agent is dissolved. Accordingly, with the present example, cleaning of the glass substrate was determined to be performed with a cleaning solution made up of sulfuric acid, L-ascorbic acid, and hydrofluoric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The glass substrate subjected to the second polishing process (principal surface mirror surface polishing process) was dipped in the above cleaning solution made up of sulfuric acid, L-ascorbic acid, and hydrofluoric acid to perform the cleaning process. The glass substrate was dipped in this cleaning solution for five minutes, and the temperature of the cleaning solution was set to 40&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">When the surface roughness of a 5 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;5 &#x3bc;m square region on the principal surface of the glass substrate subjected to this cleaning process was measured with an atomic force microscope (AFM), 4.0 nm at the Rmax, 2.0 nm at the Rp, 2.0 nm at the Rv, and 0.4 nm at the Ra were measured. Also, when the surface thereof was analyzed with an atomic force microscope and an electron microscope, the surface was a mirror surface shape, and no protruding shaped and recessed shaped faults and foreign objects were observed. No residue of the polishing agent was detected.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">(7) Chemical Strengthening Process</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The glass substrate subjected to the cleaning process was subjected to chemical strengthening processing. The chemical strengthening processing is performed by putting chemical strengthening salt into a chemical strengthening processing bath, and dipping the glass substrate held by a holding member in the dissolved chemical strengthening salt. According to the specific method of the chemical strengthening processing, the chemical strengthening salt wherein potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate are mixed was prepared, this chemical strengthening salt was heated to 400&#xb0; C. to be dissolved, and the glass substrate subjected to cleaning was preheated to 300&#xb0; C., and dipped for around three hours. Thus, lithium and sodium in the glass substrate surface layer are substituted with sodium and potassium within the chemical strengthening molten salt respectively by dipping the glass substrate in the chemical strengthening molten salt, thereby subjecting the glass substrate to chemical strengthening. The thickness of the compression stress layer formed on the surface layer of the glass substrate was around 100 &#x3bc;m. The glass substrate subjected to the chemical strengthening processing was subjected to the cleaning and drying processes in order of sulfuric acid cleaning, neutral detergent cleaning, deionized water cleaning, alcohol cleaning, and alcohol steam drying.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Upon the principal surfaces of the glass substrate obtained through the above processes being analyzed using an atomic force microscope and an electron microscope, the principal surfaces were in a mirror surface shape, and no protruding and recessed shaped defects and foreign objects were found. No residue of the polishing agent was detected either. The surface roughness was generally the same as that following the cleaning process.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Thus, the glass substrate for a magnetic disk was manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">(8) Magnetic Disk Manufacturing Process</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">On both surfaces of the glass substrate for a magnetic disk obtained through the above processes, the first base layer of NiTa, the second base layer of Ru, and a CoCrPtB magnetic layer were formed in order using a DC magnetron sputtering device, and subsequently, a hydride carbonaceous protective layer was formed with film thickness of 40 angstroms using the plasma CVD method, and an alcohol denatured perfluoro polyether lubricant agent was applied and formed with film thickness of 10 angstroms using the dip method, thereby manufacturing a magnetic disk. This magnetic disk is a magnetic disk employing the vertical magnetic recording method.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">[HDD Mounting Test]</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The obtained magnetic disk was mounted on a hard disk drive (HDD) employing the load/unload method of which the maximum recording density was 60 gigabits/inch<sup>2</sup>. The flying amount of the magnetic head to be mounted on this hard disk drive was 10 nm, and an NPAB slider (negative pressure slider) was employed as a slider. A magneto-resistance effect-type reproducing device was employed as a reproducing device. Upon a test being performed with this hard disk drive, recording and reproducing were safely performed without any occurrence of head-crashing, thermal asperity, or fly-stiction. Load/unload movements were repeated 600,000 times, with no failure detected.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Comparative Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Various cleaning solutions were composed as a cleaning solution at the cleaning process (cleaning process following mirror surface polishing), and performances in cleaning were compared. The composition, behavior, and effects of each cleaning solution are summarized in the following table 1. The same glass substrate for a magnetic disk, and the same magnetic disk manufactured by the same manufacturing method as the example 1 were used except for these points. The evaluation method and so forth are the same as described above.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Comparative Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, mirror surface polishing was performed using a fluorine cerium oxide polishing agent of 6% by weight at F (fluorine atoms) in the second polishing process (principal surface mirror surface polishing process). Except for these points, the same glass substrate for a magnetic disk, and the same magnetic disk manufactured by the same manufacturing method as the example 1 were used. The evaluation method and so forth were also the same.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Consequently, performance of solution as to the polishing agent was not sufficient, so upon the glass substrate surface following cleaning being</p>

observed using an atomic force microscope and an electron microscope, minute protrusions which were assumed to be residual polishing agent were confirmed on some glass substrates. Also, recessed portions and portions of which the surface roughness was great were found in some spots, which were supposed to be caused by etching due to the residual polishing agent at the minute regions of the glass substrate.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Similarly, upon a test being performed with a fluorine cerium oxide polishing agent of which the content of F (fluorine atoms) was changed variously (5% by weight, 2% by weight, and 1% by weight), we found that the same results as the example 1 can be obtained in the event of 5% by weight or less.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Referential Example</heading>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Next, a referential experiment according to the present invention was performed, so description will be added regarding this experiment.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">A reagent having the same composition as the cleaning solution employed in the cleaning process (cleaning process following mirror surface polishing) according to the example 1 was composed, and behavior thereof as to aluminosilicate glass was researched. Specifically, the compositions of sulfuric acid and ascorbic acid were the same as those in the cleaning solution according to the example 1, but reagents having various concentrations of fluorine ion were composed by adjusting the additional amount of hydrofluoric acid. Normally, hydrofluoric acid is liquid employed for an etching solution as to glass, so we assumed that we should disclose the concentrations of fluorine ion that do not inhibit the behavior and advantages of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Specifically, reagents of seven standards were composed of which the concentrations of fluorine ion are 1 ppm, 5 ppm, 10 ppm, 30 ppm, 40 ppm, 50 ppm, and 100 ppm. Etching velocity was surveyed by bringing these reagents into contact with aluminosilicate glass having the same composition as with the example 1. Consequently, we found that at the concentration of fluorine ion of 40 ppm or less, the etching velocity was 0.01 nm/min at most, which is essentially no etching, but on the other hand, the etching velocity rapidly increased to 0.1 nm/min at the concentration of 50 ppm, and exceeded 0.5 nm/min at 100 ppm. The etching amount may be maintained in a predetermined amount or less even at 50 ppm or more by strictly managing a period for performing the cleaning process, but this provides difficulty upon process control. Accordingly, from the perspective of maintaining a stable mass production line, the concentration of fluorine ion is preferably set to 40 ppm or less.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Next, with the example 1, the glass substrate for a magnetic disk and the magnetic disk subjected to the tape polishing processing were manufactured following the chemical strengthening process and prior to the magnetic disk manufacturing process. The texture made up of streak grooves oriented in the circumferential direction of the disk was formed by subjecting the surface of the disk-shaped glass substrate to the tape polishing processing. Specifically, the minute texture was formed on the surface of the glass substrate by bringing the polishing tape made up of resin fiber cloth into contact with the surface of the glass substrate subjected to the chemical strengthening processing, and rotating the glass substrate while supplying diamond abrasives. Upon the surface of the glass substrate subjected to this texture formation being observed with an atomic force microscope, the surface roughness was the same as that in the example 1, but an exquisite texture shape was formed on the surface thereof. The streaks making up the texture were oriented in the circumferential direction of the disk. Protruding and recessed portions and gouges formed by foreign objects which would disrupt the texture shape were also not detected. Film formation was performed on this glass substrate as with the example 1 to manufacture a magnetic disk. However, the first base layer was substituted with a CrTa base layer, the second base layer was substituted with an AlRu base layer, and a CrMo base layer was provided as the third base layer between the second base layer and the magnetic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Thus, the magnetic disk employing the in-plane magnetic recording method was manufactured. The same glass substrate for a magnetic disk, and the same magnetic disk manufactured by the same manufacturing method as the example 1 were shown except for these points. An HDD mounting test was performed regarding the obtained magnetic disk, and the same appropriate results as with the example 1 were obtained. Next, the magnetic anisotropy of the magnetic disk was surveyed. Specifically, coercive force (Hc1) in the circumferential direction of the magnetic disk and coercive force (Hc2) in the radius direction were measured, and Hc1/Hc2 was evaluated as a magnetic anisotropy index (OR). Measurement of coercive force was performed using the magnetic properties evaluation method with a VSM (vibration sampling-type magnetization measuring device). At this time, the maximum application external magnetic field was set to 8 kOe. Consequently, the OR was provided with 1.2 or so. This means that this magnetic disk was distinguished by 20% in the magnetic properties (coercive force in this case) in the circumferential direction as to those in the radius direction.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">While the present invention has thus far been described in conjunction with a few examples thereof, it will be readily possible for those skilled in the art to put the present invention into practice in various other manners. For example, the present invention may be applied to each end surface of the glass substrate. In other words, the post-cleaning process according to the present invention may be not only applied to the principal surface but also each end surface of the glass substrate. More specifically, the polishing agent tends to be left on the end surface also and is difficult to be removed from the end surface because the end surface is roughened in comparison with the principal surfaces. In addition, even when no polishing process is carried out on the principal surfaces, the grinding agent is often left on the end surface. At any rate, the post-cleaning process is very effective to remove any remnant from the end surface when the post-cleaning process is executed on the end surface of the glass substrate. With this method, it is possible to prevent occurrence of any dust from the end surface and therefore to avoid thermal asperity. This method is especially effective when the glass substrate has a small diameter equal to or less than 7 mm. This is because such a small glass substrate has an inner hole of a very small inner diameter so that cleaning becomes difficult and adhesion of the polishing agent is unavoidable on the end surface which defines the inner hole. The post-cleaning process according to the present invention enables to remove the polishing agent from the end surface. In this event, the present invention depends on a surface roughness of the end surface of the glass substrate. However, the present invention is effective when the surface roughness Ra of the end surface may be equal to or less than 1 micron meter and may be preferably equal to or less than 0.5 micron meter, more preferably equal to or less than 0.05 micron meter. In addition, the end surface may be preferably subjected to the mirror polishing process.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a gelatinizer for alkaline batteries, and an alkaline battery. More specifically, the present invention relates to a gelatinizer for cathodes of alkaline batteries made mainly of alkaline electrolyte and zinc powder, and an alkaline battery using the gelatinizer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hitherto, a mixture of a high-concentration alkaline electrolyte (a high-concentration potassium hydroxide aqueous solution, in which zinc oxide or the like is dissolved if necessary), and zinc powder and/or zinc alloy powder has been mainly used in cathodes of alkaline batteries. In order to prevent the precipitation or fluidization of the zinc powder and/or the like in the alkaline electrolyte, gelatinizers obtained by crosslinking poly(meth)acrylic acid or salts thereof with a crosslinking agent are used. The gelatinizers are usually classified into two types, one thereof being fine particle form crosslinked poly(meth)acrylic acids obtained by precipitation-polymerization or some other operation of (meth)acrylic acid in an organic solvent such as benzene in the presence of a very small amount of a crosslinking agent such as divinylbenzene, and the other being crosslinked polymers of poly(meth)acrylic acid and/or an alkali metal salt thereof having a relatively large particle size, a typical example of which is an water-absorbing resin. The former are used mainly to improve the viscosity of electrolytes or improve the injection property of batteries (supply the fluidity of electrolytes), and the latter are used mainly to improve the impact resistance of batteries. In many battery makers, the two are used together (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 6-349484 and 7-65818).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, these gelatinizers have advantageous effects for preventing the precipitation or fluidization of zinc powder, improving the impact resistance of batteries, preventing liquid leakage from batteries and attaining others, but if the amount of the added gelatinizer becomes larger, the gelatinizer causes the internal resistance value of the battery to be raised, so as to result in problems such that the discharge characteristic or the lifespan of the battery is lowered.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present inventors made eager investigation in light of the above-mentioned situation. As a result, it has been found out that the discharge characteristic, the lifespan and others of a battery can be improved, with the impact resistance and others of the battery being kept, by adding a super fine particle form additive to the above-mentioned gelatinizer or adding a super fine particle form additive together with the gelatinizer to an alkaline electrolyte.

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the present invention, crosslinked polymer particles (A), which constitute one of constituting components of a gelatinizer for alkaline batteries, are polymer particles comprising, as one or more main constituting monomer units, (meth)acrylic acid and/or an alkali metal salt thereof. It is necessary that this polymer is stable over a long period even under strong alkalinity of an alkaline electrolyte. The polymer is preferably a polymer crosslinked with a crosslinking agent which is not cut itself or a crosslinking agent wherein crosslinking points are not cut.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Herein, (meth)acrylic acid means acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. A metal salt thereof is a salt obtained by neutralizing acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with an alkali metal such as potassium, sodium, and lithium.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">About the neutralization of (meth)acrylic acid with an alkali metal in the present invention, the crosslinked polymer particles (A) may be non-neutralized particles or neutralized particles since the gelatinizer of the present invention is used in an aqueous alkaline solution having a high concentration; however, a part or the whole of (meth)acrylic acid may be neutralized as the need arises in order to improve workability, pulverize the (A) easily or attain others when the (A) are produced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When (meth)acrylic acid is neutralized, it is advisable that usually an alkali metal hydroxide, such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide, or an aqueous solution thereof is added to a monomer before polymerization or a polymer after the polymerization and then the components are mixed. The crosslinking agent which is not cut itself or the crosslinking agent wherein crosslinking points are not cut over a long period even under strong alkalinity of an alkaline electrolyte has a poor water-solubility in many cases. Thus, when (meth)acrylic acid is polymerized in the state that the neutralization degree thereof is high, the crosslinking agent is insufficiently dissolved in an aqueous solution of the monomer and separated even if a given amount of the crosslinking agent is added thereto. Consequently, a given uniform crosslinking cannot be performed so that the crosslinked polymer (A) having desired physical properties may not be obtained. It is therefore preferable to set the neutralization degree of (meth)acrylic acid into 0 to 30% by mole, polymerize the (meth)acrylic acid, and subsequently adjust the neutralization degree if necessary by adding, to the polymer, an alkali metal hydroxide.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the crosslinked polymer particles (A) are produced in the present invention, (meth)acrylic acid and/or an alkali metal salt thereof as one or more monomers is/are polymerized as one or more main constituting monomer units. If necessary, a different monoethylenic unsaturated monomer which can be copolymerized with (meth)acrylic acid (alkali) may be copolymerized therewith. The different monoethylenic unsaturated monomer may be any copolymerizable monomer, and is not particularly limited. Examples thereof include anionic ethylenic unsaturated monomers such as carboxylic acid (salt) group containing monomers such as maleic acid (alkali metal salts), fumaric acid (alkali metal salts) and itaconic acid (alkali), sulfonic acid (salt) group containing monomers such as acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (alkali), sulfoalkyl (meth)acrylate, and styrenesulfonic acid (alkali);</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">nonionic water-soluble ethylenic unsaturated monomers such as (meth)acrylamide, N-alkyl (having 1 to 3 carbon atoms) substituted (meth)acrylamide [such as N-methylacrylamide and N,N-dimethylacrylamide], N-vinylacetoamide, monohydroxyalkyl (having 1 to 3 carbon atoms) mono(meth)acrylate, polyethylene glycol (polymerization degree: 2 to 100) mono(meth)acrylate, polypropylene glycol (polymerization degree: 2 to 100) mono(meth)acrylate, and methoxypolyethylene glycol (polymerization degree: 2 to 100) mono(meth)acrylate; and</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">other monoethylenic unsaturated monomers such as (meth)alkyl (having 1 to 5 carbon atoms) acrylate, and vinyl acetate. These ethylenic unsaturated monomers may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof in an amount within a given range.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The amount of the added ethylenic unsaturated monomer other than (meth)acrylic acid and/or alkali metal salt thereof is preferably from 0 to 50% by mass, more preferably from 0 to 30% by mass of (meth)acrylic acid used at the time of polymerization thereof. Hereinafter, &#x201c;%&#x201d; represents % by mass unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the present invention, the crosslinking agent which is not cut itself or the crosslinking agent wherein crosslinking points are not cut over a long period even under strong alkalinity of an alkaline electrolyte is preferably a copolymerizable crosslinking agent which has in the molecule thereof no functional group which is easily hydrolyzed under strong alkalinity, such as an ester bond or an amide bond and which does not generate any functional group which is easily hydrolyzed under strong alkalinity even by crosslinking reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Examples of such a copolymerizable crosslinking agent include allyl ether type crosslinking agents such as (b1) crosslinking agents having in the molecule thereof two allyl groups and no hydroxyl groups, typical examples of which are alkylene (having 2 to 5 carbon atoms) glycol diallyl ether and polyethylene glycol diallyl ether (Mw: 100 to 4,000); (b2) crosslinking agents having in the molecule thereof two allyl groups and 1 to 5 hydroxyl groups, typical examples of which are glycerin diallyl ether, trimethylolpropane diallyl ether, pentaerythritol dially ether, and polyglycerin diallyl ether; (b3) crosslinking agents having in the molecule thereof 3 to 10 allyl groups and no hydroxyl group, typical examples of which are trimethylolpropane triallyl ether, glycerin triallyl ether, pentaerythritol tetraallyl ether, and tetraallyloxyethane; and (b4) crosslinking agents having in the molecule thereof 3 to 10 allyl groups and 1 to 5 hydroxyl groups, typical examples of which are pentaerythritol triallyl ether, diglycerin triallyl ether, and polyglycerin (polymerization degree: 3 to 13) polyallyl ether; and (b5) vinyl type crosslinking agents such as divinylbenzene and divinylbenzenesulfonic acid. These crosslinking agents may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Among these crosslinking agents, the (b4) are preferable. Since the (b4) have in the molecule thereof 1 to 5 hydroxyl groups and 3 to 10 allyl groups, the (b4) have good compatibility with acrylic acid and/or alkali metal salts. Additionally, the (b4) can make up for low copolymerizability peculiar to allyl groups since the number of the allyl groups in the (b4) is large. Consequently, effective crosslinking can be attained. Thus, the (b4) are preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the present invention, the added amount of the crosslinking agent (b), which depends on the kind of the used crosslinking agent and the average polymerization degree of (meth)acrylic acid, is preferably from 0.01 to 2.0% by mass, more preferably from 0.03 to 1.0% by mass of (meth)acrylic acid (alkali). If the added amount is 0.01% or more by mass, the spinnability of the produced gelatinizer in aqueous alkali solution can be decreased and further the stability of the gelatinizer in aqueous alkali solution is improved so that a fall in the viscosity with the passage of time can be prevented. If the added amount is 2.0% or less by mass, the crosslink density of the crosslinked polymer does not become very high so that the absorption thereof into aqueous alkali solution does not lower. Consequently, the viscosity of the aqueous alkali solution to which the gelatinizer is added does not lower. Thus, the separation of the alkali electrolyte can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described above, in the present invention, the crosslinking agent (b) which is not cut itself or the crosslinking agent (b) wherein crosslinking points are not cut over a long period even under strong alkalinity of an alkaline electrolyte is preferable as the crosslinking agent. When there is used an ester type copolymerizable crosslinking agent used in ordinary water-absorbing resins, such as trimethylolpropane triacrylate, amide type copolymerizable crosslinking agents, a typical example of which is methylenebisacrylamide, or carboxylic acid reactive type crosslinking agents, a typical example of which is ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, the resultant crosslinked structure decomposes easily under strong alkalinity. Accordingly, effect is hardly produced on decrease in the spinnability under strong alkalinity or improvement in the stability of gel concentration over a long period. However, some effect may be produced on improvement in the dispersibility of the gelatinizer in alkali electrolyte, improvement in the absorption rate thereof in alkali electrolyte, or the like. Thus, a small amount of a different crosslinking agent (c) may be used together with the (b).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Examples of the crosslinking agent (c) include (c1) copolymerizable crosslinking agents having in the molecule thereof 2 to 10 functional groups, typical examples of which are N,N&#x2032;-methylenebisacrylamide, ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane di(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol di(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tri(meth)acrylate, and pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate; and (c2) crosslinking agents reactive with carboxylic acid, typical examples of which include polyhydricglycidyl compounds, a typical example of which is ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, polyhydric isocyanate compounds, a typical example of which is 4,4&#x2032;-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, polyhydric amine compounds, a typical example of which is ethylenediamine, and polyhydric alcohol compounds, a typical example of which is glycerin.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the case that the above-mentioned reactive crosslinking agent (c2) is used, it is common that at any stage after the addition of the crosslinking agent the reaction system is heated preferably at 100 to 230&#xb0; C., more preferably at 120 to 160&#xb0; C. to advance the crosslinking reaction. The reactive crosslinking agents (c2) may be alone within the range of given amounts, or may be used in combination of two or more thereof. Furthermore, the agent(s) (c2) may be used together with the above-mentioned copolymerizable crosslinking agent (c1).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The added amount of these different crosslinking agents (c), which are added if necessary, is preferably from 0 to 0.5%, more preferably from 0 to 0.3% by mass of (meth)acrylic acid (alkali).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Examples of the polymerization method for obtaining the crosslinked polymer in the present invention include aqueous solution polymerization, reversed-phase suspension polymerization, (organic) solution polymerization, bulk polymerization, the so-called precipitation polymerization, wherein a difference between the solubility of a monomer and that of the resultant polymer in an organic solvent such as benzene is used to conduct polymerization, and emulsion polymerization, wherein a suitable emulsifier is used to polymerize an aqueous solution of (meth)acrylic acid (alkali metal salt) in an organic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Among these polymerization methods, aqueous solution polymerization, reversed-phase suspension polymerization and precipitation polymerization are preferable since the molecular weight of the cross-linked polymer is easily raised to improve the viscosity-increasing effect of the gelatinizer easily. Aqueous solution polymerization is more preferable when the following is also taken into consideration: the standpoint that an organic solvent which may produce a bad effect on the human body or environment, such as benzene, is not used.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thereafter, the crosslinked polymer obtained by the above-mentioned polymerization is subjected to distillation-off/removal of water or organic solvents or to drying if necessary. Furthermore, the resultant is pulverized and the particle size thereof is adjusted into a given particle size if necessary. In this way, crosslinked polymer particles (A) are produced.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The particle size of the crosslinked polymer particles (A) of the present invention is usually adjusted in such a manner that the average particle size of the dried product thereof will be from 0.1 to 2,000 &#x3bc;m, preferably from 0.1 to 1,000 &#x3bc;m. If the particle size is less than 0.1 &#x3bc;m, the production of the particles or the isolation thereof from the solvent or the like is difficult in many cases. On the other hand, if the particle size is more than 2,000 &#x3bc;m, in the cathode container or filling line of an alkaline battery the particles cannot be put into the container or the line may be clogged since the particles are too large. The average particle size in the present invention means mass-average particle size. The mass-average particle size is measured by the method of plotting each particle size distribution of the cross-linked polymer onto a logarithm probability sheet wherein its transverse axis represents the particle size thereof and its vertical axis represents the content thereof on the basis of mass, and then obtaining the particle size at the point where 50% of the mass of the whole is occupied. It is preferable about the particle size of the (A) that the content by percentage of the particles having a size of less than 0.1 &#x3bc;m is 3% or less and the content by percentage of the particles having a size of more than 2,000 &#x3bc;m is 3% or less.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the case that, in particular, particles having an average particle size of 100 to 2,000 &#x3bc;m (a1) or, in particular, particles having an average particle size of 100 to 1,000 &#x3bc;m (a1&#x2032;), among the particles having particle sizes within the above-mentioned range, are used as the gelatinizer for alkaline batteries, they produce a particularly good effect on improvement in the impact resistance of the batteries. On the other hand, in particular, particles having an average particle size of 0.1 to 100 &#x3bc;m (a2), more preferably particles having an average particle size of 0.1 to 50 &#x3bc;m (a2&#x2032;), have a high viscosity but can give fluidity to electrolyte; therefore, they have an excellent effect for improving the injecting property thereof into batteries using a pump or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the crosslinked polymer particles (A) having a given particle size are produced, pulverization, which is performed if necessary, may be based on an ordinary pulverizing method (for example, an impact crusher, a pin mill, a cutter mill, a Skirel mill, or a ball mill) in the case of the (a1). In the case of the (a2), it is preferable to use a high-speed rotation impact crusher such as an ACM pulverizer, air pulverization (a jet crusher or the like), freezing pulverization, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Usually, according to precipitation polymerization or emulsion polymerization, particles at a polymerization stage are already fine particles (0.1 to 100 &#x3bc;m) Therefore, if the solvent or the like is distilled off by such a method as spray drying or vacuum evaporation, pulverization or the like may not be newly performed in many cases.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The particle form crosslinked polymers (a1) and (a2) may be used alone or in combination. In order to aim for the above-mentioned two effects, that is, in order to improve the impact resistance of a battery and make a high-speed injection of an electrolyte having an increased viscosity into a battery container easy, using a pump or the like, it is preferable to use the (a1) and the (a2) together, or use the (a1) and the (a2) mixed in advance. The mixing ratio between the (a1) and the (a2) may be arbitrary.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The added amount of the crosslinked polymer particles (A) is preferably from 0.1 to 10% by mass, more preferably from 1 to 5% by mass of a 35-40% solution of potassium hydroxide in water, which is an alkaline electrolyte, as the total amount of the (a1) and the (a2). If the added amount is 0.1% or more by mass, the viscosity-increasing effect of the crosslinked polymer particles (A) is insufficiently exhibited. If the amount is 10% or less by mass, the increased viscosity of the electrolyte is not made very high. Thus, the electrolyte is easy to handle.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">(Super Fine Particle form Metal Oxide)</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The super fine particle form metal oxide (1) used in the present invention is any super fine particle form metal oxide which has an average particle size of 0.1 to 100 &#x3bc;m and is capable of being added to a gelatinizer or alkaline electrolyte, whereby the viscosity-increasing property of the gelatinizer can be made high. A metal oxide such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CuO, In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SnO<sub>2 </sub>or Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>is preferable when the following is also taken into consideration: the standpoint that even under ordinary use conditions for alkaline batteries, that is, even under strong alkalinity of an alkaline electrolyte having a temperature of &#x2212;10 to 80&#xb0; C., the oxide (1) is not dissolved over a long period and hydrogen gas is not generated in the cathode container thereof or a rise in the internal resistance value is not caused. TiO<sub>2 </sub>is practical and particularly preferable when the matter that TiO<sub>2 </sub>is easily available, costs thereof, and others are also taken into consideration. These metaloxides may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The impurity content in the super fine particle form metal oxide (1) used in the present invention is preferably as small as possible for the use thereof. In particular, the content of metals which may generate hydrogen gas or some other gas when the metals are incorporated into an alkaline battery cathode material, such as iron, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, lead, antimony and vanadium, is preferably 1% or less by mass, more preferably 0.1% or less by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The particle size of the super fine particle form metal oxide (1) is usually from 0.1 to 100 nm, preferably from 0.1 to 50 nm. If the particle size is more than 100 nm, the viscosity-increasing effect may be insufficient. On the other hand, if the particle size is less than 0.1 nm, the particles are neither easily produced nor easily obtained in many cases. About the shape of the super fine particle form metal oxide (1), no especial limitation is imposed thereon. Examples of the shape include spherical, granular, block and scaly shapes. The average particle size can be measured by an ordinary method, for example, calculation from values obtained by the BET method, Sears method or laser method.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the (1) is added to the crosslinked polymer particles (A), the added amount thereof is preferably from 0.1 to 50 parts by mass, more preferably from 0.5 to 30 parts by mass in relative to 100 parts by mass of the (A). If the added amount is 0.1 part or more by mass and 50 parts or less by mass, the viscosity-increasing effect of the gelatinizer is sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The adding method in the case of adding the (1) to the (A) may be performed at any stage when the crosslinked polymer particles (A) are produced if the particle size of the (1) can be maintained. However, if the (1) enters the inside of the (A), the (1) is covered with the (A) so that the particle size cannot be maintained. It is therefore preferable to add the (1) after or when the crosslinked polymer is pulverized into powder and, if necessary, perform blend.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Especial limitation is not imposed on the addition device in the case of the adding the (1) to the (A) if the device makes it possible to add a given amount thereof. When a powder mixer such as a conical blender, a V-shaped mixer, a ribbon blender or a kneader is used, they can easily be mixed.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">(Alkaline Battery)</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Another of the present invention is an alkaline battery wherein the (A) and the (1) are blended with a cathode material.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Usually, the cathode material of an alkaline battery is composed of 30 to 200 parts of zinc powder or zinc alloy powder having an average particle size of about 10 to 400 &#x3bc;m and about 0.1 to 10 parts of a gelatinizer {crosslinked polymer particles (A)} in relative to 100 parts of an alkaline electrolyte (an aqueous 35-40% solution of potassium hydroxide wherein zinc oxide is dissolved). However, the alkaline battery of the present invention is a battery wherein a given amount of the fine particle form metal oxide (1) is further added thereto. The added amount of the (1), which depends on the added amount of the used (A), is from 0.001 to 5% by mass, preferably from 0.01 to 3% by mass of the alkaline electrolyte. If the added amount is less than 0.001% by mass, the viscosity-increasing effect is insufficient. On the other hand, if the added amount is more than 5% by mass, a bad effect may be produced on the discharge characteristic of the alkaline battery.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The method for adding the (1) in the case of adding the (1) when the cathode material of the alkaline battery is produced may be any method which makes it possible that the cathode material of the alkaline battery can be homogeneously mixed with the (1). Examples thereof include a method of adding the (1) at the same time when an about 35-40% solution of potassium hydroxide in water, which is an alkaline electrolyte, is mixed with zinc powder, zinc oxide and the crosslinked polymer particles (A) so as to produce an alkaline battery cathode material, and then mixing the added components; a method of adding the gelatinizer of the present invention, that is, the (A) to which the (1) is added; a method of blending the (1) beforehand with used zinc powder, and subsequently adding another cathode material thereto; a method of adding the (A) and the (1) to an aqueous potassium hydroxide solution wherein zinc oxide is dissolved, and adding thereto zinc powder.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">After the mixing according to the above-mentioned method, the amount of the (1) can be mixed for further adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The thus-produced alkaline battery can be preferably used as a primary battery for toys, portable CD players, portable MD players, electrical appliances for which a good impact resistance or discharge characteristic is required, and portable household electrical appliances.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Hereinafter, the present invention is further described by way of the following examples and comparative examples. However, the present invention is limited thereto. As crosslinked polymers used in the examples and comparative examples, crosslinked polymers-1 to 3 were produced or obtained by the following methods.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">(Synthesis of a Crosslinked Polymer-1)</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Into a 2 L beaker were put 200 g of acrylic acid, 0.4 g (0.2% by mass of acrylic acid) of pentaerythritol triallyl ether (manufactured by Daiso Co., Ltd.), and 800 g of ion exchange water, and then the resultant was cooled to 8&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">This aqueous acrylic acid solution was put into a 1.5 L heat-insulated polymerizing tank, and nitrogen was caused to flow in the aqueous solution so as to set the amount of oxygen dissolved in the aqueous solution into 0.1 ppm or less. Thereto were added 4.0 g of 0.1% hydrogen peroxide water, 4.0 g of a 0.1% solution of L-ascorbic acid in water, and 1.0 g of a 10% solution of 2,2&#x2032;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (trade name: V-50, manufactured by Wako Pure Chemicals, Industries) in water. Nitrogen purge into the aqueous solution was continued till the start of polymerization. Since the polymerization started so that the viscosity of the aqueous acrylic acid solution started to rise, the nitrogen purge was stopped and the polymerization was continued for 6 hours. The temperature of the aqueous acrylic acid solution was measured with a dotting thermometer. As a result, the highest arrival temperature was 63&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A crosslinked hydrated gel in a block form was taken out from the heat-insulated polymerizing tank, and a small-sized meat chopper (manufactured by Loyal Co.) was used to subdivide the gel into a size of 3 to 10 mm. Thereafter, thereto was added 139 g of a 40% solution (neutralization degree: 50% by mol) of sodium hydroxide (extra pure reagent) in water, so as to neutralize the hydrated gel.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The neutralized hydrated gel was laminated into a thickness of 5 cm on a screen made of SUS and having a sieve opening of 850 &#x3bc;m size. A small-sized air-infiltrating drier (manufactured by Inoue Kinzoku Co.) was used to infiltrate hot wind of 120&#xb0; C. temperature into the hydrated gel for one hour to dry the hydrated gel.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A cooking mixer was used to pulverize the dried product, and a sieve was used to collect particles having particle sizes of 210 to 850 &#x3bc;m (average particle size: 400 &#x3bc;m). In this way, a crosslinked polymer-1 was obtained.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">(Synthesis of a Crosslinked Polymer-2)</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A jet mill crusher (manufactured by Nippon Pneumatic Mfg. Co., Ltd.) was used to subject the crosslinked polymer-1, which was obtained as described above, to pulverization and classification. In this way, a crosslinked polymer-2 having an average particle size of 15 &#x3bc;m was obtained.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">(Synthesis of a Crosslinked Polymer-3)</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A commercially available JUNLON PW-150 (crosslinked polyacrylic acid fine particles, a product obtained by precipitation polymer in benzene, average particle size of 1 &#x3bc;m, crosslinking agent: divinylbenzene, manufactured by Nihon Junyaku Co., Ltd.) per se was used as a crosslinked polymer-3.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A liquid chromatography having an UV detector (extracting solvent: hexane, measuring wavelength: 320 nm) was used to measure the amount of benzene remaining in this crosslinked polymer-3. As a result, the remaining amount of benzene was 15,100 ppm.</p>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">EXAMPLES 1 TO 3</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Into a vinyl polymer bag were put 100 g of each of the crosslinked polymers-1 to 3 and 5 g of highly-pure titanium oxide having an average particle size of 21 nm (trade name: P-25, manufactured by Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd.).

<heading id="h-0024" level="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 TO 3</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The crosslinked polymers-1 to 3 were used, as they were, as comparative gelatinizers (a) to (c).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The gelatinizers (1) to (7) of the present invention and the comparative gelatinizers (a) to (c) were used to measure the viscosity thereof in a 40% solution of potassium hydroxide in water and the added amount thereof for adjusting the viscosity of a cathode composition by the following methods. The results are shown in Table 1.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">(I) Viscosity in a 40% by Mass Solution of Potassium Hydroxide in Water</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Into a 250 ml transparent polymer container with a lid was put 200 g of a 40% by mass solution of potassium hydroxide in water, wherein 3% zinc oxide was dissolved. To this solution was added each of a 1.5% by mass gelatinizer, a 2.0% by mass gelatinizer, and a 2.5% by mass gelatinizer. The polymer container was tightly closed up, and then the whole of the container was vigorously shaken for about one minute. This container, in which the aqueous potassium hydroxide solution was put, was allowed to stand still in a thermostat of 25&#xb0; C. temperature for one hour. Thereafter, a digital B type viscometer (manufactured by TOKIMEC Co.) was used to measure the viscosity of the content therein. Before the measurement, a Teflon rod was used to stir the content uniformly. The resultant value was defined as the viscosity after one hour.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">(Measurement Temperature: 40&#xb0; C., Rotor No. 4, Rotation Number: 3 rpm)</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The sample the viscosity measurement of which was finished was again kept airtight. The sample was again put into the thermostat of 25&#xb0; C. temperature and was allowed to stand still in the state that the sample was kept airtight for 24 hours. Thereafter, the digital B type viscometer was used to measure the viscosity of the content under the same conditions. The resultant value was defined as the viscosity after one day.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">(II) Necessary Addition Amount of the Gelatinizer</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">There were added 500 g of a 40% by mass solution of potassium hydroxide in water, wherein 3% by mass zinc oxide was dissolved, and 300 g of zinc powder. The gelatinizer was added thereto until the viscosity after one day came up to 200 Pa&#xb7;s (25&#xb0; C., 3 rpm, Rotor No. 4). The added amount thereof was defined as the necessary addition amount of the gelatinizer.</p>
<heading id="h-0028" level="1">EXAMPLE 8</heading>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The crosslinked polymer-2 was used as a gelatinizer, and the viscosity and the necessary addition amount thereof were measured according to the above-mentioned methods (I) and (II) except that when the viscosity and the necessary addition amount were measured by the methods (I) and (II), 0.1% by mass titanium oxide (P-25) was separately added to the 40% by mass solution of potassium hydroxide in water. The results are shown in Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The necessary addition amounts of the gelatinizers (1) to (7) of the present invention, the comparative gelatinizers (a) to (c) and the gelatinizer obtained by the method of Example 8 were used to fabricate model batteries by the following method. The internal resistance values of the batteries, the durations of the batteries, and the impact resistance of the batteries were measured by the following methods. The results are shown in Table 2.</p>
<p id="h-0029" num="0000">(Fabrication of Each Model Battery)</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">To a kneader having an inner volume of 1 L (inner package: treatment with Teflon) were added 500 g of a 40% by mass solution of potassium hydroxide in water, wherein 3% by mass zinc oxide was dissolved, and the necessary addition amount of each of the gelatinizers, the amount being obtained as described above (in Example 8, 0.1% by mass titanium oxide was separately added to the 40% by mass solution of potassium hydroxide in water). The components were then sufficiently mixed for 60 minutes. Thereafter, the resultant was allowed to stand still for 24 hours to prepare a gelatinized zinc electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The gelatinized zinc electrolyte was degassed under reduced pressure. Subsequently, this zinc electrolyte was used, and 15 g thereof was injected into a cathode container of a LR-20 type model battery illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this way, a model battery was fabricated.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">(III) Internal Resistance Value of the Battery</p>

<p id="h-0032" num="0000">(V) Impact Resistance of the Battery</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">An external resistance having a resistance value of 2 &#x3a9; at room temperature (20 to 25&#xb0; C.) was connected to a model battery fabricated in the same way as described above. While the battery was continuously discharged, the model battery was repeatedly dropped 10 times from a height of 1 m. The voltage before the drop and the voltage just after the drop were measured, and then the impact resistance (%) was calculated from the following equation:

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The gelatinizer or the alkaline battery of the present invention produces advantageous effects as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">(i) The addition of a given amount of a super fine particle form metal oxide in the production of a gelatinizer or an alkaline batter makes it possible to raise the viscosity-increasing effect of the gelatinizer largely. Accordingly, the necessary addition amount of the gelatinizer, which is a cause for raising the internal resistance value of the alkaline battery so as to lower the duration of the battery, can be drastically reduced. Therefore, the duration of the battery can be raised while the impact resistance of the battery is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">(ii) The addition of the fine particle form metal oxide to a gelatinizer causes an improvement in the dispersibility of the gelatinizer in an alkaline electrolyte. Therefore, the viscosity of the electrolyte can be increased in a short time. The improvement contributes to a reduction in the time for producing a battery.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">(iii) In the case that an aqueous-solution-polymerized product is used as a gelatinizer, difference in viscosity-increasing effect, which is a problem of conventional aqueous-solution-polymerized products, can be overcome as compared with a product precipitation-polymerized in benzene. Accordingly, a battery containing none of materials harmful to the human body, such as benzene, can be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Since the above-mentioned advantageous effects are produced, the gelatinizer of the present invention is useful as a gelatinizer for primary and secondary alkaline batteries, such as alkaline button batteries, silver oxide batteries, nickel cadmium storage batteries, and nickel hydrogen storage batteries as well as cylindrical alkaline batteries.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national phase application of PCT International Application No. PCT/GB2003/004622, filed Oct. 23, 2003, and claims priority of British Patent Application No. 0225961.2, filed Nov. 7, 2002.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the production of hydrocarbons by the Fischer-Tropsch process and to the production of synthesis gas therefor. The synthesis gas contains hydrogen and carbon oxides and is produced by the catalytic reaction of steam with a hydrocarbon feedstock in a process known as steam reforming.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Steam reforming is widely practised and is used to produce hydrogen streams and synthesis gas for a number of processes such as ammonia, methanol as well as the Fischer-Tropsch process. In a steam reforming process, a desulphurised hydrocarbon feedstock, e.g. methane, natural gas or naphtha, is mixed with steam and passed at elevated temperature and pressure over a suitable catalyst, generally a transition metal, especially nickel, on a suitable support. Methane reacts with steam to produce hydrogen and carbon oxides. Any hydrocarbons containing two or more carbon atoms that are present are converted to carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and in addition, the reversible methane/steam reforming and shift reactions occur. The extent to which these reversible reactions proceed depends upon the reaction conditions, e.g. temperature and pressure, the feed composition and the activity of the reforming catalyst. The methane/steam reforming reaction is highly endothermic and so the conversion of methane to carbon oxides is favoured by high temperatures. For this reason, steam reforming is usually effected at outlet temperatures above about 600&#xb0; C., typically in the range 650&#xb0; C. to 950&#xb0; C., by passing the feedstock/steam mixture over a primary steam reforming catalyst disposed in externally heated tubes. The composition of the product gas depends on, inter alia, the proportions of the feedstock components, the pressure and temperature. The product normally contains methane, hydrogen, carbon oxides, steam and any gas, such as nitrogen, that is present in the feed and which is inert under the conditions employed. For applications such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, it is desired that the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide is about 2 and the amount of carbon dioxide present is small.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to obtain a synthesis gas more suited to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the primary reformed gas may be subjected to secondary reforming by partially combusting the primary reformed gas using a suitable oxidant, e.g. air or oxygen. This increases the temperature of the reformed gas, which is then passed adiabatically through a bed of a secondary reforming catalyst, again usually nickel on a suitable support, to bring the gas composition towards equilibrium. Secondary reforming serves three purposes: the increased temperature resulting from the partial combustion and subsequent adiabatic reforming results in a greater amount of reforming so that the secondary reformed gas contains a decreased proportion of residual methane. Secondly the increased temperature favours the reverse shift reaction so that the carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide ratio is increased. Thirdly the partial combustion effectively consumes some of the hydrogen present in the reformed gas, thus decreasing the hydrogen to carbon oxides ratio. In combination, these factors render the secondary reformed gas formed from natural gas as a feedstock more suited for use as synthesis gas for applications such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis than if the secondary reforming step was omitted. Also more high grade heat can be recovered from the secondary reformed gas: in particular, the recovered heat can be used to heat the catalyst-containing tubes of the primary reformer. Thus the primary reforming may be effected in a heat exchange reformer in which the catalyst-containing reformer tubes are heated by the secondary reformed gas. Examples of such reformers and processes utilising the same are disclosed in for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,690,690 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,695,442.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 00/09441 describes a process wherein a feedstock/steam mixture is subjected to primary reforming over a catalyst disposed in heated tubes in a heat exchange reformer, the resultant primary reformed gas is subjected to secondary reforming by partially combusting the primary reformed gas with an oxygen-containing gas, the resultant partially combusted gas then being brought towards equilibrium over a secondary reforming catalyst, and the resultant secondary reformed gas used to heat the tubes of the heat exchange reformer. In the process, no hydrocarbon feedstock by-passes the primary reforming stage. Carbon dioxide is separated from the secondary reformed gas before or after its use for the synthesis of carbon containing compounds, and is recycled to the primary reformer feed. In one embodiment described in WO 00/09441, the recycled carbon dioxide is part of the tail gas from a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process, and is added to the natural gas feedstock prior to desulphurisation of the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Fischer-Tropsch tail gas is liable to contain a significant amount of carbon monoxide. If this is added to the feedstock prior to primary reforming in a heat exchange reformer, the carbon monoxide undergoes the exothermic methanation reaction resulting in a faster increase in temperature of the gas undergoing reforming than if the tail gas had not been added. The temperature difference between the gas undergoing reforming and the heating medium is thus decreased and so more heat transfer area, e.g. more and/or longer heat exchange tubes, is required for a given reforming duty.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In our co-pending application PCT/GB 02/03311 we have demonstrated that this problem may be overcome by addition of the Fischer-Tropsch tail gas to the primary reformed gas before partial combustion thereof, i.e. addition of tail gas to the primary reformed gas between the steps of primary and secondary reforming. Such addition, where carbon dioxide is present in the tail gas or is added from another source, further has the effect of allowing lower steam ratios to be used in the primary reformer. [By the term &#x201c;steam ratio&#x201d; we mean the ratio of the number of moles of steam to the number of gram atoms of hydrocarbon carbon in the feed: thus a methane/steam mixture comprising 2 moles of steam per mole of methane has a steam ratio of 2.] This has advantages in respect of providing lower operating costs, for example in steam generation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Use of lower steam ratios, for example steam ratios below 1.00, can, however, lead to carbon formation on the exposed surfaces of the catalyst. Such carbon formation has the undesirable effect of increasing the pressure drop through the catalyst. It can also result in a loss of catalyst activity. Thus there is a desire to use lower steam ratios than those previously achieved without the risk of increasing carbon deposition.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">We have found that operation at low overall steam ratios with economical reforming of the hydrocarbon feedstock may be achieved by dividing the feedstock into two streams, mixing the first stream with steam and feeding it to the primary reformer and feeding the second stream to the primary reformed gas before secondary reforming along with at least part of the tail gas from the Fischer-Tropsch process. The steam ratio is therefore lower overall but still sufficiently high in the primary reforming step to avoid carbon deposition.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0026">In the present invention, the primary reforming is effected using a heat exchange reformer. In one type of heat exchange reformer, the catalyst is disposed in tubes extending between a pair of tube sheets through a heat exchange zone. Reactants are fed to a zone above the upper tube sheet and pass through the tubes and into a zone beneath the lower tube sheet. The heating medium is passed through the zone between the two tube sheets. Heat exchange reformers of this type are described in GB 1 578 270 and WO 97/05 947.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0027">Another type of heat exchange reformer that may be used is a double-tube heat exchange reformer as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,910,228 wherein the reformer tubes each comprise an outer tube having a closed end and an inner tube disposed concentrically within the outer tube and communicating with the annular space between the inner and outer tubes at the closed end of the outer tube with the steam reforming catalyst disposed in said annular space. The external surface of the outer tubes is heated by the secondary reformed gas. The mixture of hydrocarbon feedstock, carbon dioxide and steam is fed to the end of the outer tubes remote from said closed end so that the mixture passes through said annular space and undergoes steam reforming and then passes through the inner tube. As in the double-tube reformer of U.S. Pat. No. 4,910,228, in the present invention preferably insulation is provided on the walls of the inner tube.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0028">In the process of the invention the feedstock may be any gaseous or low boiling hydrocarbon feedstock such as natural gas or naphtha. It is preferably methane or natural gas containing a substantial proportion, e.g. over 90% v/v methane. If the feedstock contains sulphur compounds, before, or preferably after, compression, but before the feedstock is divided, the feedstock is subjected to desulphurisation, e.g. hydrodesulphurisation and absorption of hydrogen sulphide using a suitable absorbent, e.g. a zinc oxide bed. The feedstock is typically compressed to a pressure in the range 10-100 bar abs, particularly 20-60 bar abs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0029">Before, or preferably after, compression of the feedstock, the feedstock is divided into two streams. The first stream is mixed with steam: this steam introduction may be effected by direct injection of steam and/or by saturation of the feedstock by contact of the latter with a stream of heated water. The amount of steam introduced is such as to give an overall steam ratio of 0.5 to 2, preferably 1 to 2, i.e. 0.5 to 2, preferably 1 to 2 moles of steam per gram atom of hydrocarbon carbon in the feedstock. The steam ratios that may be employed in the process present invention without carbon deposition may be affected by the choice of primary steam reforming catalyst. Typically lower steam ratios may be used when the primary steam reforming catalyst is a precious metal-based catalyst compared to nickel-based catalysts. The amount of steam is preferably minimised as this leads to a lower cost, more efficient process. It is preferred that the steam ratio is below 1.5, more preferably below 1.0. When a steam ratio below 1.0 is used it is preferable that at least a portion of the primary steam reforming catalyst is a precious metal catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0030">The resultant feedstock/steam mixture is then subjected to reforming. Before it is fed to the heat exchange reformer, the feedstock/steam mixture may be subjected to a step of adiabatic low temperature reforming. In such a process, the hydrocarbon/steam mixture is heated, typically to a temperature in the range 400-650&#xb0; C., and then passed adiabatically through a bed of a suitable catalyst, usually a catalyst having a high nickel content, for example above 40% by weight. During such an adiabatic low temperature reforming step any hydrocarbons higher than methane react with steam to give a mixture of methane, carbon oxides and hydrogen. The use of such an adiabatic reforming step, commonly termed pre-reforming, is desirable to ensure that the feed to the heat exchange reformer contains no hydrocarbons higher than methane and also contains a significant amount of hydrogen. This is desirable in order to minimise the risk of carbon formation on the catalyst in the heat-exchange reformer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0031">After any such pre-reforming step, the mixture is further heated, if necessary, to the heat exchange reformer inlet temperature, which is typically in the range 300-500&#xb0; C. During passage through the reforming catalyst, the endothermic reforming reaction takes place with the heat required for the reaction being supplied from the secondary reformed gas flowing past the exterior surface of the outer tubes. The primary reforming catalyst may be nickel supported on a refractory support such as rings or pellets of calcium aluminate cement, alumina, titania, zirconia and the like. Alternatively, particularly when a steam ratio less than 1.0 is employed, a precious metal catalyst may be used as the primary reforming catalyst. Suitable precious metal catalysts include rhodium, ruthenium and platinum between 0.01 and 2% by weight on a suitable refractory support such as those used for nickel catalysts. Alternatively a combination of a nickel and precious metal catalyst may be used. For example, a portion of the nickel catalyst may be replaced with a precious metal catalyst, such as a ruthenium-based catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0032">The temperature of the secondary reformed gas is preferably sufficient that the gas undergoing primary reforming leaves the catalyst at a temperature in the range 650-850&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0033">In the present invention a proportion of the total hydrocarbon feedstock fed to the process (the second stream) bypasses the primary reforming step and is combined with the primary reformed gas to form a secondary reformer feed stream which is then subjected to partial combustion in a secondary reforming step. The resulting secondary reformed gas is de-watered and used as the synthesis gas for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons. A tail gas from the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is recycled to the secondary reformer feed stream. In forming the secondary reformer feed stream the Fischer-Tropsch tail gas and second hydrocarbon stream may be added separately in any order to the primary reformed gas or may be pre-mixed if desired before being fed to the primary reformed gas. Pre-mixing the tail gas and second hydrocarbon stream has the advantage that, if necessary, they may be heated together in one rather than two heat exchangers. Howsoever the second hydrocarbon stream and the Fischer-Tropsch tail gas are added it is preferable, to avoid decomposition of the hydrocarbons therein, that they are not heated to temperatures in excess of 420&#xb0; C. prior to combination with the primary reformed gas.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0034">The secondary reformer feed stream comprising the primary reformed gas/hydrocarbon/tail gas mixture is then subjected to secondary reforming by adding a gas containing free oxygen, effecting partial combustion and passing the partially combusted gas through a secondary reforming catalyst. Whereas some steam may be added to the oxygen containing gas, preferably no steam is added so that the low overall steam ratio for the reforming process is achieved. The secondary reforming catalyst is usually nickel supported on a refractory support such as rings or pellets of calcium aluminate cement, alumina, titania, zirconia and the like. The gas containing free oxygen is preferably substantially pure oxygen, e.g. oxygen containing less than 1% nitrogen. However where the presence of substantial amounts of inerts is permissible, the gas containing free oxygen may be air or enriched air. Where the gas containing free oxygen is substantially pure oxygen, for metallurgical reasons it is preferably fed to the secondary reformer at a temperature below about 250&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0035">The amount of oxygen required in the secondary reformer is determined by two main considerations, viz. the desired composition of the product gas, and the heat balance of the heat exchange reformer. In general, increasing the amount of oxygen, thereby increasing the temperature of the reformed gas leaving the secondary reformer, causes the [H<sub>2</sub>]/[CO] ratio to decrease and the proportion of carbon dioxide to decrease. Alternatively, if the conditions are arranged such that the temperature is kept constant, increasing the temperature at which the feedstock is fed to the heat exchange reformer decreases the amount of oxygen required (at a constant oxygen feed temperature). Decreasing the required amount of oxygen is advantageous as this means that a smaller, and hence cheaper, air separation plant can be employed to produce the oxygen. The temperature of the feedstock can be increased by any suitable heat source, which may, if necessary, be a fired heater, which of course can use air, rather than oxygen, for the combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0036">The amount of oxygen-containing gas added is preferably such that 40 to 60 moles of oxygen are added per 100 gram atoms of hydrocarbon feedstock fed to the primary and secondary reforming stages. Preferably the amount of oxygen added is such that the secondary reformed gas leaves the secondary reforming catalyst at a temperature in the range 800-1050&#xb0; C. For a given feedstock/steam mixture, amount and composition of the oxygen-containing gas and reforming pressure, this temperature largely determines the composition of the secondary reformed gas.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0037">The secondary reformed gas is then used to provide the heat required for the primary reforming step by using the secondary reformed gas as the hot gas flowing past the tubes of the heat exchange reformer. During this heat exchange the secondary reformed gas cools by transferring heat to the gas undergoing primary reforming. Preferably the secondary reformed gas cools by several hundred &#xb0; C. but of course it will leave the heat exchange reformer at a temperature somewhat above the temperature at which the feedstock/steam/carbon dioxide mixture is fed to the heat exchange reformer. Preferably the secondary reformed gas leaves the heat exchange reformer at a temperature in the range 500-650&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0038">After leaving the heat exchange reformer, the secondary reformed gas is then further cooled. Heat recovered during this cooling may be employed for reactants pre-heating and/or for heating water used to provide the steam employed in the primary reforming step. As described hereinafter, the recovered heat may additionally, or alternatively, be used in a carbon dioxide separation step.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0039">The secondary reformed gas is cooled to a temperature below the dew point of the steam in the secondary reformed gas so that the steam condenses. The condensed steam is then separated. The cooling to effect condensation of the steam may be effected by contacting the secondary reformed gas with a stream of cold water: as a result a stream of heated water is formed which may be used to supply some or all of the steam required for reforming.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0040">Typically the secondary reformed gas contains 5 to 15% by volume of carbon dioxide (on a dry basis). In one embodiment of the invention, after separation of the condensed water, carbon dioxide is separated from the synthesis gas prior to the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis stage and recycled to the synthesis gas production. Such recycle of carbon dioxide is preferred as it provides a means to control [H<sub>2</sub>]/[CO] ratio to achieve the optimal figure for FT synthesis of about 2. Preferably the amount of recycled carbon dioxide is maximised up to the quantity which is needed to achieve this ratio. Typically this may be at least 75%, particularly at least 90%, of the carbon dioxide in the de-watered secondary reformed gas. The recycled carbon dioxide stream may be added, as in the aforesaid WO 00/09441, to the feedstock prior to feeding the latter to the heat exchange reformer or preferably to the secondary reformer feed stream before the latter is fed to the secondary reforming step. The carbon dioxide may be added before, after or together with the hydrocarbon feedstock and tail gas. Preferably the recycled carbon dioxide is added separately to the secondary reformer feed stream because it may be heated to temperatures greater than 420&#xb0; C. As stated above, where the recycled carbon dioxide (either as carbon dioxide separated from the synthesis gas prior to synthesis and recycled, or as the recycled tail gas) is added to the primary reformed gas, rather than to the feedstock prior to primary reforming, there is an advantage in that the primary reforming process can be operated at a lower steam ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0041">The carbon dioxide may be separated by a conventional &#x201c;wet&#x201d; process or alternatively a pressure swing adsorption process may be employed. In a conventional &#x201c;wet&#x201d; process the secondary reformed gas is de-watered and is then contacted with a stream of a suitable absorbent liquid, such as an amine, particularly methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) solution so that the carbon dioxide is absorbed by the liquid to give a laden absorbent liquid and a gas stream having a decreased content of carbon dioxide. The laden absorbent liquid is then regenerated, for example by heating, to desorb the carbon dioxide and to give a regenerated absorbent liquid, which is then recycled to the carbon disoxide absorption stage. At least part of the desorbed carbon dioxide is recycled to the primary reforming step as described above. If the carbon dioxide separation step is operated as a single pressure process, i.e. essentially the same pressure is employed in the absorption and regeneration steps, only a little recompression of the recycled carbon dioxide will be required. Unless it is desired that the product synthesis gas has a very low carbon dioxide content, it is generally not necessary to effect the regeneration of the absorbent liquid to a very low carbon dioxide content.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0042">Alternatively, or in addition to a stage of carbon dioxide separation and recycle, before the de-watered synthesis gas is passed to the Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis stage it may be further subjected to a step of hydrogen separation, e.g. through a membrane in order to provide pure hydrogen for other uses e.g. hydrocracking or hydrodesulphurisation. In this situation, the tail gas recycle (in the absence of carbon dioxide separation and recycle) or the carbon dioxide recycle stream are controlled to give a [H<sub>2</sub>]/[CO] ratio, which is higher than the optimum for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, so that after the required amount of hydrogen is separated the resulting synthesis gas has an [H<sub>2</sub>]/[CO] ratio of about 2.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0043">In the Fischer-Tropsch process, a synthesis gas containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen is reacted in the presence of a catalyst, which is typically a cobalt- and/or iron-containing composition. The process may be effected using one or more fixed catalyst beds or one or more reactors using a moving catalyst, for example a slurry of the catalyst in a hydrocarbon liquid. The product hydrocarbon liquid is separated from the residual gas. The reaction may be carried out in a single pass or part of the residual gas may be combined with fresh synthesis gas and recycled to the Fischer-Tropsch reactor. Any residual gas which is not recycled to the Fischer-Tropsch reactor for further reaction is herein termed tail gas. Since the reaction of the synthesis gas is incomplete, the tail gas will contain some hydrogen and carbon monoxide. In addition, the tail gas may also contain some light hydrocarbons, e.g. paraffins including methane, ethane, butane, olefins such as propylene, alcohols such as ethanol, and traces of other minor components such as organic acids. It will generally also contain some carbon dioxide, which may be present in the synthesis gas fed to the Fischer-Tropsch reaction and/or is formed by side reactions. Possibly, as a result of incomplete separation of the liquid hydrocarbon product, the tail gas may also contain a small proportion of higher hydrocarbons, i.e. hydrocarbons containing 5 or more carbon atoms. These components of the tail gas represent a valuable source of carbon and hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0044">In the present invention at least part of the tail gas is recycled and used as part of the feedstock employed to make the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis gas. The amount of tail gas recycled is preferably between 5 and 100% by volume of the tail gas produced in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis stage.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0045">In the present invention the hydrocarbon feedstock is divided into two streams. The second hydrocarbon stream bypasses the primary reforming step and is added to the secondary reformer feed stream prior to combustion thereof in the secondary reformer. The second hydrocarbon stream comprises between 5 and 50% by volume, preferably between 5 and 40% by volume and most preferably between 5 and 30% by volume of the hydrocarbon feedstock. Amounts less than 5% by volume provide too small a benefit whereas amounts greater than 30%, especially 50% are less economically attractive due to a consequential increase in size and cost of the primary reformer (because of the resulting drop in the secondary reformed gas temperature and thereby heat exchange with the primary reformer), or increased requirement for oxygen in the secondary reforming step.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0046">By providing a proportion of the hydrocarbon feedstock and at least part of the Fischer-Tropsch tail gas to the primary reformed gas, it is possible to operate the process at low overall steam ratios without the risk of carbon deposition. Overall steam ratios in the range 0.8 to 1.2 may be achieved using the process of the present invention without the risk of significant carbon deposition in the primary reforming stage.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0047">Referring now to the drawing. in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, hydrocarbon feedstock, for example natural gas containing over 90% v/v methane, fed via line <b>10</b> is divided into two streams.

<p id="p-0040" num="0048">The feedstock/steam mixture undergoes primary steam reforming in the tubes <b>26</b> and the primary reformed gas leaves the heat exchange reformer <b>28</b> via line <b>30</b>, typically at a temperature in the range 650 to 850&#xb0; C.</p>

Part of the tail gas is purged as stream <b>72</b> to avoid a build up of inerts, e.g. nitrogen which may be present in the hydrocarbon feedstock or oxygen-containing gas fed to the secondary reformer. The purged tail gas may be used as fuel, for example in a fired heater used for heating the mixture of first hydrocarbon stream and steam fed to the heat exchange reformer.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a unidirectional mechanism useful in electrical disconnects and in particular to a unidirectional mechanism providing smooth rotation and high strength.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a disconnect in the form of a standard fuse block <b>10</b> of the prior art may receive fuse cartridges <b>12</b> along its front face and may attach at its rear face to the rear wall <b>14</b> of a metal cabinet <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Input terminals along the top of fuse block <b>10</b> may receive wires <b>18</b> which connect independently to one side of each fuse cartridge <b>12</b>, the latter which interconnect wires <b>18</b> to wires <b>20</b> attached to output terminals along the bottom of the fuse cartridge <b>12</b>. Wires <b>18</b>, for example, may be connected to a source of three-phase power and wires <b>20</b>, for example, may be connected to a motor or other piece of equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Fuse block <b>10</b> may be activated to electrically disconnect wires <b>18</b> from the respective fuse cartridges <b>12</b>. The fuse block <b>10</b> may be controlled by a rotary shaft <b>22</b> along one side of the fuse block <b>10</b> and extending in an orientation perpendicular to the rear wall <b>14</b> of cabinet <b>16</b> toward an open face of the cabinet.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The open face of the cabinet may be covered by a door <b>24</b> attached by hinges to one side of the cabinet <b>16</b>. Door <b>24</b> may support a captively mounted rotary knob <b>26</b> having an inwardly extending connector <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, knob <b>26</b> may include connector <b>28</b> that extends inwardly through an opening in the door <b>24</b>. Connector <b>28</b> includes retaining flanges <b>30</b> for retaining it rotatably within that opening.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When door <b>24</b> is closed about the cabinet <b>16</b>, connector <b>28</b> of the knob <b>26</b> engages the outermost end of rotary shaft <b>22</b>, thereby allowing rotary shaft <b>22</b> to be operated by knob <b>26</b> when door <b>24</b> is closed on cabinet <b>16</b>. Specifically, an inwardly facing end of connector <b>28</b> may include a keyway <b>32</b> receiving a rectangular end of rotary shaft <b>22</b> and a pin <b>34</b> extending perpendicularly through the rotary operator. Turning knob <b>26</b>, in turn, rotates shaft <b>22</b> to electrically disconnect or connect power to wires <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, knob <b>26</b> allows disconnection of power to wires <b>20</b> when the door <b>24</b> on the cabinet <b>16</b> is closed. However, when door <b>24</b> is open, rotary shaft <b>22</b> is exposed, thereby enabling power to be inadvertently reconnected by counter rotation the shaft <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One apparatus for preventing the reconnection of power while the door is open includes a mechanism that is connected to the exterior of fuse block <b>10</b> as described in U.S. Pat.

The mechanism enables knob rotation to connect and disconnect the power when the door is closed, and further prevents inadvertent counter rotation of the knob to reconnect the power when the door is open. While this apparatus is suitable for its intended purpose, the mechanism requires modification of an existing fuse block.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. Pat. No. 6,881,909, entitled: &#x201c;Fuse Block With Integral Door Sensing Rotary Disconnect&#x201d; also assigned to the assignee of the present invention and hereby incorporated by reference, describes a handle, accessible within the door, is open and incorporating a uni-directional mechanism that allows disconnecting of power by turning the handle, and the block reconnecting of power by turning the handle in the opposite direction until a secondary operation of pulling the handle out is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The unidirectional mechanism employed in the above inventions uses a set of pawl teeth that engage a slotted disk. U.S. Application 2005/0040019 entitled: &#x201c;Fuse Block with Integral Door Sensing Rotary Disconnect&#x201d;, also assigned to the assignee of the present invention and hereby incorporated by reference, describes a unidirectional mechanism employing balls fitting between a scalloped track and inner drive providing smooth relative rotation between the drive and the track in one direction, and a positive rotational locking of the drive in the other direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides an improved uni-directional mechanism using balls selectively locking a track and drive for one direction of motion. The present inventors have recognized that control of the contact surfaces to the ball, ideally to be parallel tangents, can significantly reduce shear force on the ridges of the track, preventing shearing of the ridges under high torque. By reducing shear forces, the ridges may be shaped for improved passage of the balls when locking of the track and drive is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Specifically then, in one embodiment, the invention provides a ball ratchet having an inner element rotatable within an outer element. A first substantially circular track is formed in one of the inner and outer elements providing a set of ridges extending radially toward an other of the inner and outer elements. A driving face is formed in the other of the inner and outer elements and facing the circular track. At least one spring-loaded ball fits between the driving face and the circular track so that (1) rotary force between the inner and outer elements in a first direction causes movement of the spring-loaded ball to compress its spring allowing the ball to navigate between the ridges, and the driving face to permit relative movement of the inner and outer elements, and (2) rotary force between the inner and outer elements in a second direction causes capture of the spring-loaded ball between the circular track, and the driving face locking the inner and outer elements for joint movement. A vector of force by the ball on the circular track does not pass through a ridge so that a shearing of the ridge would permit rotation in the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus it is one object of at least one embodiment of the invention to provide a ball ratchet mechanism with improved torsional strength for a given ridge depth. It is another object of at least one embodiment of the invention to relax the requirements of ridge height.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The tangent lines to contract points of the ball on the inner and outer elements when the ball is captured between the inner and outer elements may be parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is thus another object of at least one embodiment of the invention to eliminate, in one embodiment, force components along the track surface such as would promote shear of the ridges.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The circular track may be on the outer element.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus it is one object of at least one embodiment of the invention to provide a proportionally larger track length to provide improved manufacture and ridge size.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The outer element may be a handle graspable by a human operator to turn the outer element, and the inner element may include a keyed bore for receiving a shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is thus another object of at least one embodiment of the invention to provide a uni-directional mechanism suitable for use with a disconnect.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The ridges present continuously rounded surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus it is another object of at least one embodiment of the invention to provide an improved ridge shape reducing resistance and noise when the ball moves along the track.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The invention may provide two spring-loaded balls symmetrically located about the inner element.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus it is another object of at least one embodiment of the invention to provide a sharing of force over multiple balls further reducing the shear force on the track ridges.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The vector of force by the ball on the circular track does not pass into space between the first and second elements.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is thus another object of at least one embodiment of the invention to prevent forces directed against the ridges that would promote a shearing of the cantilevered profile of the ridges.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">These particular objects and advantages may apply to only some embodiments falling within the claims and thus do not define the scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the present invention modifies the fuse block <b>10</b> described above by mounting an operator assembly <b>36</b> to the axially outer end of a rotary shaft <b>22</b> coupled to the fuse block <b>10</b>. While an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is described of controlling electrical current through fuse block, it should be appreciated that the present invention is applicable to any electrical disconnect, including fuses, circuit breakers, and traditional switches.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Operator assembly <b>36</b> extends generally axially, and interfaces with door knob <b>26</b> and, in particular, with connector <b>28</b>. Operator assembly <b>36</b> is thus operable by a user to connect power to fuses on fuse block <b>10</b>, and disconnect power from fuse block <b>10</b>. Operator assembly <b>36</b> preferably comprises a plastic, though one skilled in the art will recognize that any material suitable to withstand the stress and strain experienced during operation falls within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in particular, one exemplary embodiment of operator assembly <b>36</b> is formed from a housing including an inner shell <b>38</b> fastened to an outer handle that retains a uni-directional coupling mechanism <b>64</b>, a clutch <b>43</b> including a spring <b>39</b>, and an inner cylindrical hub <b>44</b>. Operator assembly <b>36</b> is carried by the axially outer end of shaft <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, inner shell <b>38</b> includes an annular cup <b>56</b> open at its axially outer end and closed at its axially inner end by an end face <b>58</b>. A circular aperture <b>55</b> extends axially through face <b>58</b>, and is centrally disposed to pass shaft <b>22</b>. The diameter of aperture <b>55</b> is greater than the largest cross-sectional dimension across shaft <b>22</b> such that rotation of shell <b>38</b> does not cause face <b>58</b> to impart rotational forces onto shaft <b>22</b>. A clip <b>96</b> is provided that includes a pin <b>98</b> and a fastener clamp <b>100</b>. Pin <b>98</b> is inserted through an aperture <b>101</b> extending radially through shaft <b>22</b>, and is retained by clamp <b>100</b> which applies radial pressure against shaft <b>22</b>. Clip <b>96</b> abuts face <b>58</b> and, accordingly, the axial location of aperture <b>101</b> determines the position of operator assembly <b>36</b> with respect to shaft <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A plurality of beveled ribs <b>60</b> extends axially along the radially inner surface of annular cup <b>56</b>. Ribs <b>60</b> are equally spaced circumferentially about annular cup <b>56</b> to define a plurality of interposed recesses <b>62</b>. A plurality of radially spaced teeth <b>59</b> extend axially out from the outer end of annular cup <b>56</b>, and are equally spaced circumferentially about annular cup <b>56</b> to define a corresponding plurality of interposed recesses <b>61</b>. A pair of opposing mounting flanges <b>57</b> extends radially out from the axially outer end of annular cup <b>56</b>, and includes a pair of apertures sized to receive corresponding screws <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>14</b>-<b>16</b>, a uni-directional coupling mechanism <b>64</b> is provided in the form of a ratchet assembly that enables uni-directional operation to disconnect power from fuse block <b>10</b>. Ratchet assembly <b>64</b> includes a bearing cup <b>66</b> having a hexagonal outer wall <b>68</b> that is sized to be received by ribs <b>60</b> such that rotation of inner shell causes cup <b>66</b> to correspondingly rotate. Cup <b>66</b> further includes an internal substantially cylindrical bore <b>70</b> forming a grooved ratchet chamber. Specifically, a track <b>73</b> defined by a plurality of axially extending arc-shaped grooves <b>71</b> (and corresponding cusp-shaped ridges <b>75</b> interposed between adjacent grooves <b>71</b>) defines the outer periphery of chamber <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Chamber <b>70</b> is closed at its axially inner end by a base <b>72</b> having a circular aperture <b>74</b> extending centrally there through that is sized to loosely and rotatably pass shaft <b>22</b>. A hexagonal cover <b>77</b> is provided and affixed to the axially outer end of bearing cup <b>66</b>. Cover <b>77</b> is preferably transparent, and defines a central aperture <b>79</b> that matches aperture <b>74</b>. As a result, rotation of shaft <b>22</b> does not directly cause bearing cup <b>66</b> and cover <b>77</b> to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Ratchet assembly <b>64</b> further includes a bearing carrier plate <b>76</b> having a generally cylindrical outer wall <b>81</b> having a diameter slightly less than the inner diameter of chamber <b>70</b>. An aperture <b>85</b> extends axially through carrier plate <b>76</b>, and defines a square or other suitable cross-section configured to snugly receive shaft <b>22</b> such that rotation of shaft <b>22</b> causes carrier plate <b>76</b> to rotate therewith. Specifically, outer wall <b>81</b> rides along grooves <b>71</b> as carrier plate <b>76</b> rotates within chamber <b>70</b> during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A pair of opposing elongated rectangular cutouts forms pockets <b>78</b> in carrier plate <b>76</b> offset 180&#xb0; with respect to each other. Each pocket <b>78</b> forms a driving face <b>80</b> and a second support wall <b>82</b> oriented perpendicular to driving face <b>80</b>. Driving face <b>80</b> is elongated with respect to support wall <b>82</b>. Each pocket <b>78</b> receives a ball <b>84</b> supported by one end of a compression spring <b>86</b> that is grounded at its other end by support wall <b>82</b>. Each spring <b>86</b> biases its corresponding ball <b>84</b> against grooved track <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When a counterclockwise torque is applied to bearing cup <b>66</b>, the force causes ridges <b>75</b> to bias ball <b>84</b> against the corresponding non-resilient driving face <b>80</b>. The counterclockwise torque is thus transferred to carrier plate <b>76</b>. Accordingly, bearing cup <b>66</b>, carrier plate, and shaft <b>22</b> all rotate counterclockwise.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">On the contrary, when a clockwise torque is applied to bearing cup <b>66</b> as indicated by Arrow A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, bearing cup <b>66</b> is caused to rotate clockwise. As bearing cup <b>66</b> rotates, the radial forces resulting from engagement between ball <b>84</b> and ridges <b>75</b> cause springs <b>86</b> to compress. The compression causes ball <b>84</b> to slide along driving face <b>80</b> as they cam over ridges <b>75</b> and fall into adjacent grooves <b>71</b> whose surfaces are defined by a radius that generally match the radius of ball <b>84</b>. Ball <b>84</b> continues to ratchet along track <b>73</b> as carrier plate <b>76</b> continues to rotate clockwise.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, a clockwise force on the cup <b>66</b> indicated by arrow A causes the ball <b>84</b> to be compressed between the track <b>73</b> and the driving face <b>80</b>. Because the driving face <b>80</b> is generally planar, it touches the ball <b>84</b> at a single contact point <b>200</b> to produce a normal force <b>202</b> on the ball <b>84</b> perpendicular to the surface of the driving face <b>80</b>. As the ball <b>84</b> is captured, the track <b>73</b> must exert a countervailing force <b>204</b> on the ball <b>84</b> equal and opposite to the normal force <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the case where the ball <b>84</b> contacts the track <b>73</b> at a single point <b>206</b>, not necessarily along the line of normal force <b>202</b>, the countervailing force <b>204</b> will be a vector component of a normal force <b>208</b> perpendicular to a tangent <b>210</b> of the track <b>73</b> at point <b>206</b>. As a general mater, the tangent <b>210</b> will not be parallel to the driving face <b>80</b>. A second vector component <b>212</b> will be directed circumferentially along a line <b>214</b> tending to urge the ball <b>84</b> against ridge <b>75</b>. In cases where the line <b>214</b> of vector component <b>212</b> passes through a ridge <b>75</b> into the space between the track <b>73</b> and driving face <b>80</b>, the risk of shearing off of the ridge <b>75</b> is created. This risk is increased by the concentration of pressure on the ridge <b>75</b> at a signal point by ball <b>84</b> as a result of the two dimensions of curvature of the ball <b>84</b> and single dimension of curvature of the track <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the track <b>73</b> is such as to admit to an area of contact between the ball <b>84</b> and the track <b>73</b>, the same analysis can be performed by assuming a single contact point <b>206</b> and normal force <b>208</b> being the weighted average of all contact points weighted by their contributed vectors.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, in a second embodiment, a track <b>300</b> having a different shape will be used in which the contact point <b>206</b>&#x2032; between the ball <b>84</b> and the track <b>300</b> is opposite the contact point <b>200</b> between the ball <b>84</b> and the driving face <b>80</b> along the line of the normal force <b>202</b>. Further, the tangent <b>210</b>&#x2032; at point <b>206</b>&#x2032; is parallel to the driving face <b>80</b>. In this way, normal force <b>208</b>&#x2032; is directly opposite to force <b>203</b>, and there is no circumferential force vector (per vector component <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) eliminating the application of shear forces on the ridges <b>75</b>. For this reason, the ridges <b>75</b> can be rounded rather than cusp-shaped smoothing the passage of the ball <b>84</b> over the track <b>300</b> when clockwise rotation is effected. While this parallel orientation of the tangent <b>210</b>&#x2032; and driving face <b>80</b> is preferred, it will be noted that a small component vector of force <b>310</b> may be allowable as long as it is directed into the body of the cup <b>66</b> and not across a ridge <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref>, ratchet assembly <b>64</b> is illustrated in accordance with several alternative embodiments having any number of pockets <b>78</b> formed in carrier plate <b>76</b>. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, three pockets <b>78</b> can be oriented 120&#xb0; with respect to each other in carrier plate <b>76</b>. Because an additional pocket <b>78</b> is provided and an additional ball <b>84</b> engages track <b>73</b>, additional torque is required to cause each ball <b>84</b> to slide along track <b>73</b> as bearing cup <b>66</b> is rotated counterclockwise. The required amount of driving torque can be increased still by providing four pockets <b>78</b> oriented 90&#xb0; with respect to each other as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Alternatively, the required amount of driving torque can be decreased by providing a single pocket <b>78</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> further illustrates bearing cup outer wall <b>68</b> as being square-shaped and sized to engage ribs <b>60</b> in accordance with one of several alternative configurations of outer wall <b>68</b> intended to fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, bearing cup <b>66</b> can be provided with a track <b>73</b> having a smooth surface as an alternative to grooves <b>71</b>. Because the frictional resistance imparted onto ball <b>84</b> by smooth track <b>73</b> is reduced, the torque necessary to rotate bearing member <b>83</b> along track <b>73</b> is also reduced with respect to the grooved track described above. Furthermore, because a line extending tangentially to smooth track <b>73</b> at a location adjacent ball <b>84</b> intersects a line extending along driving face <b>80</b>, ball <b>84</b> will engage track <b>73</b> when a counterclockwise torque is applied to bearing cup <b>66</b>, thereby rotatably coupling bearing cup <b>66</b> and carrier plate <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>, hub <b>44</b> includes a generally cylindrical body <b>50</b> defining an internal seat that receives one end of a coil spring <b>39</b> that is seated at its opposite end against the outer axial surface of cover <b>77</b>. Spring <b>39</b> is a compression spring that provides a force biasing hub <b>44</b> axially out towards handle <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Cylindrical body <b>50</b> is closed at one end by an axially front face <b>46</b> sized to be engaged by connector <b>28</b>. Accordingly, when door <b>24</b> is closed, connector <b>28</b> depresses hub <b>44</b> against the force of spring <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">An aperture <b>65</b> extends axially through hub <b>44</b>, and defines a square cross-section configured to snugly receive shaft <b>22</b> such that rotation of hub <b>44</b> causes shaft <b>22</b> to also rotate. It should be easily appreciated, however, that shaft <b>22</b> and aperture <b>65</b> (along with the other shaft-engaging components) could assume any alternative cross-sectional shape without departing from the present invention. The axially outer end of aperture <b>65</b> defines a keyway <b>47</b> extending only partially into hub <b>44</b> sized to receive a pin <b>34</b> extending transverse from the axially outer end of shaft <b>22</b>. Shaft <b>22</b> and hub <b>44</b> thus rotate in concert while keyway <b>47</b> prevents shaft <b>22</b> from being pulled through hub <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, a bi-directional coupling mechanism <b>67</b> includes a plurality of beveled pawls <b>52</b> extending radially out from the axially inner end of body <b>50</b> and are equally spaced circumferentially about body <b>50</b> to define interposed recesses <b>53</b> that are sized to receive ribs <b>60</b>. Likewise, pawls <b>52</b> are received by recesses <b>62</b>. It will thus be appreciated that the diameter defined by opposing recesses <b>62</b> is slightly greater than the diameter defined by opposing pawls <b>52</b>, and the diameter defined by opposing ribs <b>60</b> is slightly greater than the diameter defined by opposing recesses <b>53</b> but less than the diameter formed by opposing pawls <b>52</b>. Coupling mechanism <b>67</b> is engaged and disengaged by clutch <b>43</b> as hub <b>44</b> is depressed and released, respectively, relative to shell <b>38</b>, as is described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When bi-directional coupling mechanism <b>67</b> is engaged, pawls <b>52</b> and ribs <b>60</b> interlock hub <b>44</b> and shell <b>38</b> with respect to rotation. Accordingly, rotation of operator assembly <b>36</b>, and in particular shell <b>38</b>, in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions causes hub <b>44</b> and shaft <b>22</b> to correspondingly rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, handle <b>40</b> is defined by an axially extending annular neck <b>48</b> that is connected at its outer end to a fluted grip <b>42</b> extending radially out from the axially outer end of handle <b>40</b>. Grip is thus configured to be intuitively engaged by the hand of a user to rotate operator assembly <b>36</b> in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions, selectively causing an internal fuse block switch (not shown) to connect and disconnect, respectively, power in fuse block <b>10</b>. It should be appreciated, however, that these directions of rotation can be reversed as desired to connect and disconnect the power.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A plurality of radially spaced notches <b>49</b> are formed in the axially inner end of neck <b>48</b>, and are equally spaced circumferentially about neck <b>48</b>, to define a corresponding plurality of locking teeth <b>51</b> interposed between adjacent notches <b>49</b>. Teeth <b>59</b> and recesses <b>61</b> of shell <b>38</b> are configured to interlock with teeth <b>51</b> and notches <b>49</b>, respectively, of handle <b>40</b>. A pair of threaded apertures <b>45</b> extends axially into grip <b>42</b> and face corresponding mounting flanges <b>57</b>. Screws <b>54</b> thus extend through flanges <b>57</b> and into apertures <b>45</b> to secure handle <b>40</b> to shell <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, annular neck <b>48</b> defines an inner diameter sized to receive cylindrical hub <b>44</b>. An annular flange <b>35</b> extends radially in from neck <b>48</b> that is sized sufficiently large to receive cylindrical body <b>50</b> of hub <b>44</b>, but is sufficiently small to abut the axially outer edges of pawls <b>52</b>. Flange <b>35</b> thus provides a stop that prevents hub <b>44</b> from sliding through handle <b>40</b> during operation while enabling relative rotation between handle <b>40</b> and hub <b>44</b> (i.e., when bi-directional coupling mechanism <b>67</b> is disengaged).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">System Operation</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Operation of operator assembly <b>36</b> will now be described with initial reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref> illustrating door <b>24</b> in an open position and hub <b>44</b> in its normal position biased outwards by spring <b>39</b>. In this position, pawls <b>52</b> are axially displaced and disengaged from ribs <b>60</b>, thus illustrating bi-directional coupling mechanism <b>67</b> in a disengaged position. As a result, when a user rotates operator assembly <b>36</b> (e.g., via handle <b>40</b>), the disengaged coupling mechanism <b>67</b> does not cause shaft <b>22</b> to correspondingly rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Rather, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, uni-directional ratchet assembly <b>64</b> operates as described above. Specifically, when a user applies a torque to operator assembly <b>36</b> in the counterclockwise direction, for example via handle <b>40</b> (i.e., in an attempt to disconnect power in fuse block <b>10</b>), inner shell ribs <b>60</b> impart a corresponding counterclockwise force onto bearing cup <b>66</b> which, in turn, causing ball <b>84</b> to engage grooved track <b>73</b> and rotatably couple bearing cup <b>66</b> and carrier plate <b>76</b>. Accordingly, counterclockwise rotation of operator assembly <b>36</b> causes carrier plate <b>76</b> (and shaft <b>22</b>) to correspondingly rotate, thus allowing power to be disconnected in fuse block <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">On the contrary, when a torque is applied to operator assembly <b>36</b> in the clockwise direction (i.e., in an attempt to connect power in fuse block <b>10</b>), bearing member(s) <b>84</b> compress corresponding spring(s) <b>86</b> and ratchet along track <b>73</b>. Accordingly, bearing cup <b>66</b> rotates about carrier plate <b>76</b> (and shaft <b>22</b>), thus preventing power from being reconnected in fuse block <b>10</b>. Furthermore, because operator assembly <b>36</b> is allowed to freely rotate in the clockwise direction, uni-directional ratchet assembly <b>64</b> provides tactile feedback that power is not permitted to be connected to fuse block <b>10</b> by simply rotating operator assembly <b>36</b>. Moreover, if the user is attempting to disconnect power from fuse block <b>10</b>, ratchet assembly <b>64</b> induces the user to rotate operator assembly <b>36</b> in the opposite, and correct, direction.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The present inventors have recognized that certain internal disconnect switches in fuse block <b>10</b> are configured to operate under a low amount of torque. The amount of torque necessary to cause ball <b>84</b> to ratchet along track <b>73</b> can be controlled at each individual pocket <b>78</b>, for example, by adjusting the spring constant of spring <b>86</b>, the geometric configuration of ridges <b>75</b>, and the size of ball <b>84</b>. Alternatively, the driving torque force can be controlled by the number of pockets <b>78</b> formed in carrier plate <b>76</b> as described above. Advantageously, the amount of torque necessary to cause ball <b>84</b> to ratchet along track <b>73</b> is less than the amount of torque necessary to operate the disconnect switch.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>12</b>, bi-directional coupling mechanism <b>67</b> can be engaged in one of two ways. First, door <b>24</b> can be closed, thus causing connector <b>28</b> to depress hub <b>44</b> relative to inner shell <b>38</b> against the biasing forces of spring <b>39</b> as indicated by Arrow B. Secondly, bi-directional coupling mechanism <b>67</b> can be engaged by manually depressing hub <b>44</b> relative to operator assembly <b>36</b> by either depressing hub <b>44</b> directly, or by pulling handle <b>40</b> out, thus raising inner shell <b>38</b> relative to hub <b>44</b>. Whether door <b>24</b> is closed or hub <b>44</b> is manually depressed relative to shell <b>38</b>, pawls <b>52</b> become interdigitated with ribs <b>60</b> thus rotatably interlocking hub <b>44</b> and operator assembly <b>36</b>. The beveled ends of teeth <b>51</b> and ribs <b>60</b> assist in engaging coupling mechanism <b>67</b>. Because shaft <b>22</b> is coupled to hub <b>44</b>, when operator assembly <b>36</b> is rotated clockwise and counterclockwise with bi-directional coupling mechanism <b>67</b> engaged, shaft <b>22</b> rotates along with operator assembly <b>36</b> causing power to be connected and disconnected, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It is thus appreciated that when door <b>24</b> is closed and a user wishes to access fuse block <b>10</b>, the user actuates knob <b>26</b>, which causes operator assembly <b>36</b> to rotate counterclockwise, thereby disconnecting power from fuse block <b>10</b>. Once door <b>24</b> is open (disconnecting bi-directional coupling mechanism <b>67</b>) and operator assembly <b>36</b> is rotated clockwise, uni-directional ratchet assembly <b>64</b> will prevent shaft <b>22</b> from reconnecting power in fuse block <b>10</b>. Rather, the user must first perform a predetermined sequence of events by manually depressing hub <b>44</b> relative to shell <b>38</b> in order to reengage bi-directional coupling mechanism <b>67</b>. While hub <b>44</b> is depressed, operator assembly <b>36</b> can be rotated clockwise to reconnect power in fuse block <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The invention has been described in connection with what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments. However, the present invention has been presented by way of illustration and is not intended to be limited to the disclosed embodiments. For example, while the present invention is applicable to fuse blocks of the type described above, it should be appreciated that the present invention is applicable to any handle-operated device that would benefit from ratchet assembly <b>64</b> and coupling mechanism <b>67</b>. Accordingly, those skilled in the art will realize that the invention is intended to encompass all modifications and alternative arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the invention, as set forth by the appended claims.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority benefit of Taiwan Patent Application Serial Nunber 093127003, filed on Sep. 7, 2004, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention generally relates to a voltage controlled oscillator, and more particularly to a multiphase voltage controlled oscillator.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, multiphase voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) have been widely applied to data-recovery systems and phase locked loop (PLL) circuits. A multiphase voltage controlled oscillator can output a plurality of oscillating signals, which have the same frequency but different phases, by controlling a voltage applied at its input, wherein the frequency of each oscillating signal is proportional to the voltage. Ideally, the phases of the oscillating signals outputted from the multiphase voltage controlled oscillator are spread uniformly throughout a range from 0 to 360 degrees so as to achieve an optimal control in applications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A typical multiphase VCO is generally formed by N delay elements as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The multiphase VCO <b>100</b> comprises N differential delay elements <b>102</b> serially connected to one another. Each differential delay element <b>102</b> has two inputs <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b </i>and two outputs <b>102</b><i>c</i>, <b>102</b><i>d</i>, and is serially connected to one another so as to form a ring-type oscillator, such that the outputs <b>102</b><i>c</i>, <b>102</b><i>d </i>of all of the delay elements <b>102</b> can output a plurality of oscillating signals, which have the same frequency but different phases. In such a configuration, the number of the generated oscillating signals is determined by the number of the delay elements. Accordingly, if, for example, 32 oscillating signals are desired to be generated by the multiphase VCO <b>100</b>, 16 differential delay elements <b>102</b> are required.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, since each delay element has a predetermined signal delay time according to its electrical characteristics, the phase differences among the oscillating signals generated by the multiphase VCO <b>100</b> may be confined by the length of the predetermined signal delay time, such that even smaller phase differences cannot be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Generally, the conventional multiphase VCO adopts a phase interpolation approach in order to obtain smaller phase differences. Taking the multiphase VCO <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for example, the phase interpolation approach can produce an extra oscillating signal between every two adjacent oscillating signals. Therefore, the multiphase VCO <b>110</b> using such a phase interpolation approach can generate more oscillating signals (i.e. more than 32) from the same 16 differential delay elements <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the uniformity of the phase differences generated through the phase interpolation approach is easily affected by manufacturing process variation or temperature fluctuation, and thus is difficult to achieve during high frequency and low frequency operations.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide a multiphase voltage controlled oscillator, which adopts a simple circuit structure to generate more oscillating signals having uniformly distributed phase differences.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The embodiments according to the present invention disclose a multiphase voltage controlled oscillator for generating a plurality of oscillating signals having uniform phase differences.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it shows a schematic circuit structure of a multiphase voltage controlled oscillator <b>200</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the multiphase voltage controlled oscillator <b>200</b> can provide 32 oscillating signals, which have the same frequency but different phases; the oscillating frequency of each oscillating signal is changed by adjusting a control voltage Vc.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this embodiment, the multiphase voltage controlled oscillator <b>200</b> comprises four ring oscillating units <b>202</b> and a phase clamping unit <b>204</b>. Each ring oscillating units <b>202</b> further comprises four differential delay elements <b>206</b>, and each differential delay element <b>206</b> has two inputs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b </i>and two outputs <b>206</b><i>c</i>, <b>206</b><i>d</i>. Each differential delay element <b>206</b> has a predetermined signal delay time such that there exist a delay (i.e. phase difference) between the signals at the inputs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b </i>and the signals at the outputs <b>206</b><i>c</i>, <b>206</b><i>d</i>. In addition, the phase difference between the signals at the input <b>206</b><i>a </i>and <b>206</b><i>b </i>is 180 degree, and the phase difference between the signals at the outputs <b>206</b><i>c </i>and <b>206</b><i>d </i>is also 180 degree.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The differential delay element <b>206</b> in this embodiment adopts the control voltage Vc as its power supply voltage (i.e. Vdd). When the control voltage Vc is larger, the oscillating frequency of each oscillating signal is higher; when the control voltage Vc is smaller, the oscillating frequency of each oscillating signal is lower. The configuration and the operation principle of the differential delay element <b>206</b> are well known in the art, and therefore are not described herein in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In each ring oscillating units <b>202</b>, the outputs <b>206</b><i>c</i>, <b>206</b><i>d </i>of the first-stage (leftmost) differential delay element <b>206</b> are, respectively, electrically connected to the inputs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b </i>of the second-stage differential delay element <b>206</b>; the outputs <b>206</b><i>c</i>, <b>206</b><i>d </i>of the second-stage differential delay element <b>206</b> are respectively electrically connected to the inputs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b </i>of the third stage differential delay element <b>206</b>; and the outputs <b>206</b><i>c</i>, <b>206</b><i>d </i>of the third-stage differential delay element <b>206</b> are respectively electrically connected to the inputs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b </i>of the fourth-stage differential delay element <b>206</b> in the same manner. Finally, the outputs <b>206</b><i>c</i>, <b>206</b><i>d </i>of the fourth-stage (rightmost) differential delay element <b>206</b> are respectively electrically connected to the inputs <b>206</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>a </i>of the first-stage (leftmost) differential delay element <b>206</b> in a manner where opposite polarities are connected together, thereby forming the ring oscillating units <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the above configuration, the four ring oscillating units <b>202</b> altogether define <b>32</b> connecting nodes, respectively labeled as a<b>1</b> through a<b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Every two connecting nodes are defined at the connections between the outputs <b>206</b><i>c</i>, <b>206</b><i>d </i>and the inputs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>d </i>of every two serially connected differential delay elements <b>206</b>. More specifically, each differential delay element <b>206</b> is electrically connected to its next-stage differential delay element <b>206</b> through two of the connecting nodes a<b>1</b>-a<b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The phase clamping unit <b>204</b> is coupled to the 32 connecting nodes a<b>1</b>-a<b>32</b> of the ring oscillating units <b>202</b> and is used for clamping the phases of the oscillating signals respectively at a plurality of specific phase angles according to its electrical characteristics, thereby achieving distribution uniformity of phase differences among the oscillating signals. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the phase clamping unit <b>204</b> can be implemented by using a resistor ring comprising a plurality of resistors.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The resistor ring <b>204</b> comprises 32 resistors R and 32 connecting nodes b<b>1</b> to b<b>32</b>, wherein the resistors R are serially connected to one another through the connecting nodes b<b>1</b> to b<b>32</b>, so as to form a ring-type structure. In this embodiment, the resistors R have substantially the same resistance value.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this embodiment, the connecting nodes b<b>1</b>-b<b>32</b> of the resistor ring <b>204</b> are respectively electrically connected to the connecting nodes a<b>1</b>-a<b>32</b> of the ring oscillating units <b>202</b> through wirings (not shown); that is, b<b>1</b> is connected to a<b>1</b>, b<b>2</b> is connected to a<b>2</b>, . . . and b<b>32</b> is connected to a<b>32</b>. In this connection manner, the four ring oscillating units <b>202</b> are electrically connected to one another through the connecting nodes b<b>1</b>-b<b>32</b> of the resistor ring <b>204</b>, thereby forming the multiphase voltage controlled oscillator <b>200</b>. The 32 oscillating signals provided by the multiphase voltage controlled oscillator <b>200</b> are outputted from the outputs <b>206</b><i>c</i>, <b>206</b><i>d </i>(i.e. the connecting nodes a<b>1</b>-a<b>32</b>) of all of the differential delay elements <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the multiphase voltage controlled oscillator <b>200</b>, the resistors R of the resistor ring <b>204</b> function as connecting devices for connecting the four ring oscillating units <b>202</b>, and have substantially the same resistance value such that the 32 oscillating signals provided by the outputs <b>206</b><i>c</i>, <b>206</b><i>d </i>(i.e. the connecting nodes a<b>1</b>-a<b>32</b>) of all of the differential delay elements <b>206</b> can have uniformly distributed phase differences through the voltage dividing effect of the resistors R. In such a configuration of the embodiment, the oscillating signals read out from two adjacent nodes (e.g. b<b>1</b> and b<b>2</b>) of each resistor R have adjacent phases.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the disclosure above only describes one embodiment of coupling manner between the ring oscillating units <b>202</b> and the phase clamping unit (i.e. resistor ring) <b>204</b>, one skilled in the art should understand that other coupling manners, which can achieve the phase clamping effect and uniformly distributed phase differences without departing from the spirit of the invention, will fall into the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each resistor R of the resistor ring <b>204</b> can be implemented by metal line or poly-silicon line. In the above embodiment, each resistor R can also be implemented by MOSFET, such as the NMOS transistor <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>. The MOSFET <b>300</b> includes a gate electrode <b>302</b>, a drain electrode <b>304</b>, and a source electrode <b>306</b>, and a voltage is applied to the gate electrode <b>302</b> for controlling the equivalent resistance value of the MOSFET <b>300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>is an equivalent circuit of the MOSFET shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>. In this embodiment, the control voltage Vc for controlling the oscillating frequency can also be applied to the gate electrode <b>302</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, so as to control the resistance value of an equivalent resistor R between the drain electrode <b>304</b> and the source electrode <b>306</b>. In such a manner, when a lower control voltage Vc is set for decreasing the oscillating frequency, it can increase the resistance value of the resistor R of the resistor ring <b>204</b> such that the ring oscillating units <b>202</b> can more easily start to oscillate; while when a higher control voltage Vc is set for increasing the oscillating frequency, it can decrease the resistance value of the resistor R of the resistor ring <b>204</b> so as to improve oscillating characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should be noted that the ring oscillating units <b>202</b> of the embodiment is not limited to be implemented by the differential delay elements each having two inputs and two outputs, and other circuit combinations formed by, for example, inverters each having only a single input and a single output, can also achieve the same objective. Although the phase clamping unit <b>204</b> in this embodiment is implemented by a resistor ring, other circuit configurations having a similar phase-clamping function can also be adopted. In addition, the number of the ring oscillating units <b>202</b> and the number of the delay elements within each ring oscillating unit <b>202</b> are not limited to four, and other numbers can also achieve the same objective.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Even only a single ring oscillating unit can achieve the same objective. Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it shows a schematic circuit structure of a multiphase voltage controlled oscillator, which only uses a ring oscillating unit, according to another embodiment of the present invention. Since the operation principle of the multiphase voltage controlled oscillator is similar to that of the previous embodiment and should be understood by the skilled in the art, it will not be described herein in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although the invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is not used to limit the invention. It is to be understood that many other possible modifications and variations can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.</p>

<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention consists of an antenna comprising at least two radiating structures, said radiating structures taking the form of two arms, said arms being made of or limited by a conductor, superconductor or semiconductor material, said two arms being coupled to each other through a region on first and second superconducting arms such that the combined structure of the coupled two-arms forms a small antenna with a broadband behavior, a multiband behavior or a combination of both effects. According to the present invention, the coupling between the two radiating arms is obtained by means of the shape and spatial arrangement of said two arms, in which at least one portion on each arm is placed in close proximity to each other (for instance, at a distance smaller than a tenth of the longest free-space operating wavelength) to allow electromagnetic fields in one arm being transferred to the other through said specific close proximity regions. Said proximity regions are located at a distance from the feeding port of the antenna (for instance a distance larger than 1/40 of the free-space longest operating wavelength) and specifically exclude said feeding port of the antenna.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">OBJECT AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present inventions relates generally to a new family of characteristic antenna structures of reduced size featuring a broadband behavior, a multiband behavior of a combination of both effects. The antennas according to the present invention include at least two radiating structures or arms, said two arms being coupled through a specific region of one or both of the arms called the proximity region or close proximity region.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There exists on the prior-art some examples of antennas formed with more than one radiating structure, said structures being electromagnetically coupled to form a single radiating device. One of the first examples would be the Yagi-Uda antenna (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, Drawing <b>3</b>). Said antenna consists of an active dipole structure, said active dipole structure being fed through a conventional feeding network typically connected at its mid-point, said dipole being coupled to a series of parasitic dipoles of different lengths, said parasitic dipoles being parallel to the active dipole. The skilled in the art will notice that the present invention is essentially different from the Yagi-Uda antenna for several reasons: first of all, because in the Yagi-Uda antenna the distance between any pair of dipoles is generally constant, that is all dipoles are parallel and no proximity region is included to strength the coupling between dipoles. The object of such a coupled parallel dipole arrangement in the Yagi-Uda antenna is to provide an end-fire, directive radiation pattern, while in the present invention the radiating arms are arranged together with the close proximity region to reduce the antenna size yet providing a broadband or multiband behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another prior-art examples of antennas including two radiating structures coupled together are stacked microstrip patch antennas (&#x201c;Miniature Wideband Stacked Microstrip Patch Antenna Based on the Sierpinski Fractal Geometry&#x201d;, by Anguera, Puente, Borja, and Romeu. IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium, Salt Lake City, USA, July 2000). In such an arrangement, an active microstrip patch of arbitrary shape placed over a ground-plane is coupled to a passive parasitic patch placed on top of said active patch. It will be noticed that said active and parasitic patches keep a constant distance between them and are not specifically coupled through a specific proximity region on any of the two patches which were closer the adjacent patch. Such a stacked microstrip patch antenna configuration provides a broadband behavior, but it is does not feature a close proximity region as described in the present invention and it does not feature a highly reduced size, since the patches are typically sized to match a half-wavelength inside the dielectric substrate of the patch, while in the present invention the antennas feature a characteristic small size below a quarter wave-length.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A prior art example of monopole and PIFA antennas which are coupled together to feature a broadband behavior are described in &#x201c;Realization of Dual-Frequency and Wide-Band VSWR Performances Using Normal-Mode Helical and Inverted-F Antennas&#x201d;, by Nakano, Ikeda, Suzuki, Mimaki, and Yamauchi, IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, Vol. 46, No 6, June 1998. Again, those examples are clearly different from the antennas described in the present invention because in all of said prior-art arrangements the active elements and the parasitic ones are parallel to each other and do not get the benefit of the close proximity region as disclosed in the present invention, which enhances the broadband behavior while contributing to the antenna miniaturization.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are some examples of structures in the prior art that include several radiating structures that are not parallel to each other. An example is the V-dipole (see for instance &#x201c;Antenna Theory, Analysis and Design&#x201d;, by Constantine Balanis, second edition) wherein there is a minimum distance between the two arms at the vertex of the V-shape, but it should be noticed that such a vertex is the feeding point of the structure and does not form a coupling proximity region between said arms as disclosed in the present invention. In the present invention, the feeding point is specifically excluded from the close proximity region since it does not contribute to a size reduction and/or multiband or broadband behavior as it is intended here. To form a dipole according to the present invention, at least one arm of the dipole needs to be folded such that said folded arm approaches the other arm to form the close proximity region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other prior-art examples of antennas with multiple radiating arms are multibranch structures (see for instance &#x201c;Multiband Properties of a Fractal Tree Antenna Generated by Electrochemical Deposition&#x201d;, by Puente, Claret, Sagu&#xe9;s, Romeu, L&#xf3;pez-Salvans, and Pous. IEEE Electronics Letters, vol. 32, No. 5, pp. 2298-2299, December 1996). Again those examples are essentially different to the present invention in which all radiating arms are interconnected through direct ohmic contact to a common conducting structure, while in the present invention at least two of the radiating arms of the antenna must be disconnected and coupled only through said close proximity region.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The skilled in the art will notice that the present invention can be combined with many prior-art antenna configurations to provide new antenna arrangements with enhanced features. In particular, it should be clear that the shape of any of the radiating arms can take many forms provided that at least two arms are included, and said arms include said close proximity region between them. In particular, in several embodiments one or several of the arms according to the present invention take the form of a Multilevel Antenna as described in the Patent Publication No. WO01/22528, a Space-Filling Antenna as described in the Patent Publication No. WO01/54225 or any other complex shape such as meander and zigzag curves. Also, in some embodiments, at least one of the arms approaches an ideal fractal curve by truncating the fractal to a finite number of iterations.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention consists of an antenna comprising at least two radiating structures, said radiating structures taking the form of two arms, said arms being made of or limited by a conductor, superconductor or semiconductor material, said two arms being coupled to each other through a region on first and second arms such that the combined structure of the coupled two-arms forms a small antenna with a broadband behavior, a multiband behavior or a combination of both effects. According to the present invention, the coupling between the two radiating arms is obtained by means of the shape and spatial arrangement of said two arms, in which at least one portion on each arm is placed in close proximity to each other (for instance, at a distance smaller than a tenth of the longest free-space operating wavelength) to allow electromagnetic fields in one arm being transferred to the other through said specific close proximity regions. Said proximity regions are located at a distance from the feeding port of the antenna (for instance a distance larger than 1/40 of the free-space longest operating wavelength) and specifically exclude said feeding port of the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Drawings <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> describe examples of antenna devices as described in the present invention. In the particular example of Drawing <b>4</b>, arms (<b>110</b>) and (<b>111</b>) are L-shaped and coupled trough a close proximity region (<b>200</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this case, the antenna is mounted on a ground-plane (<b>112</b>) and it is fed at one of the tips (<b>102</b>) of arm (<b>110</b>), while arm (<b>111</b>) is directly connected to ground (<b>103</b>). Although in a very basic configuration, this example contains the essence of the invention (the two arms or radiating structures coupled through a close proximity region (<b>200</b>), defined by folded parts (<b>108</b>) and (<b>109</b>) from arms (<b>110</b>) and (<b>111</b>)). In the particular example of Drawing <b>5</b>, it can be seen that the position of the proximity region (<b>201</b>) can be placed in other locations. Arm (<b>100</b>) is straight, whereas arm (<b>113</b>) has been folded. The antenna system is mounted on a ground-plane (<b>112</b>) and it is fed at one of the tips (<b>102</b>) or arm (<b>100</b>), whereas arm (<b>113</b>) is connected to ground (<b>103</b>). In both drawings <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> it can be seen that distance Ws is smaller than distance Wd. Other many embodiments and configurations are allowed within the scope and spirit of the present invention, as it is described in the preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It must be noticed that, according to the present invention the distance between the two radiating arms cannot be constant since at least a proximity region needs to be formed in a portion of the two arms to enhance the coupling from one arm to the other, according to the present invention. In other words, the distance between said two arms in the direction that is orthogonal to any of the arms is not constant throughout all the arms. This specifically excludes any antenna made of two radiating arms that run completely in parallel at a constant distance between them (such as the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The feeding mechanism of the present invention can take the form of a balanced or unbalanced feed. In an unbalanced embodiment, the feeding port (<b>102</b>) is defined between at least one point in a first of two said arms ((<b>110</b>) or (<b>100</b>)) and at least one point on a ground plane (<b>112</b>) or ground counterpoise (see for instance (<b>102</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In this unbalanced case, arm (<b>111</b>) or (<b>113</b>) is shorted to said ground plane or ground counterpoise (<b>112</b>). Also, in this unbalanced feeding scheme the proximity region ((<b>200</b>) and (<b>201</b>)) is clearly distinguished within the structure because the minimum distance between arms Ws in said proximity region is always smaller than the distance Wd between the feeding point (<b>102</b>) in said first arm ((<b>110</b>) or (<b>100</b>)) and the grounding point (<b>103</b>) at said second arm ((<b>111</b>) or (<b>113</b>)).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a balanced scheme (see for instance Drawing <b>75</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>), one point at each of the two radiating structures or arms defines the differential input port (<b>183</b>) between said two arms (<b>182</b>, <b>184</b>). In this case, the proximity region excludes such a differential feed region and it is located at a distance larger than 1/40 of the free-space operating wavelength from said feed region. Again, it must be noticed that in this arrangement the distance between said arms (<b>182</b>, <b>184</b>) cannot be constant and will typically include two close regions: the feeding region (<b>183</b>) defining said differential input, and the proximity region which is characteristic of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">One important aspect of the present invention is that no contact point exists between the two radiating arms defining the antenna. Said two arms form two separated radiating elements, which are coupled by the characteristic close proximity region, but no ohmic contact between said two arms is formed. This specifically excludes from the present invention any antenna formed by a single radiating multibranch structure where two or several of the radiating arms on said multibranch structure can be coupled through a proximity region. The difference between the present invention and said multibranch structures is obvious, since in a multibranch structure all radiating arms or branches are connected in direct ohmic contact to a single conducting structure, while the present invention is specifically made of at least two separated radiating structures with no direct contact among them.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Regarding the shape of the radiating arms of the antenna, they can take any form as long as they include the characteristic proximity region between them. In some embodiments L or U shaped arms are preferred. In other embodiments the arms take the form of complex multilevel and space-filling structures, and even in some embodiments one or two of the arms approach the shape of a fractal form. In fact, the shape of the arms is not a differential aspect of the invention; the differential aspect of the invention is the proximity region that provides a strong coupling between the otherwise independent radiating arms.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It can be noticed that the scope of the present invention is not limited to structure formed by two radiating arms. Three or more radiating arms can be included within the invention as long as at least two of them define a close proximity region as described above. In some embodiments, multiple arms are coupled together through a single close proximity region. In other embodiments, the some of the several arms are coupled together through several proximity regions.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The main advantages of the present invention with respect to other prior art antennas are:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0019">(a) A reduced size or height with respect to other quarter-wavelength resonating elements.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0020">(b) A broadband behavior with typical bandwidths around 50% and beyond.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0021">(c) A better return-loss and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) at the input port.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0022">(d) An enhanced radiation efficiency compared to other antennas of the same size.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0023">(e) An enhanced gain compared to other antennas of the same size.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">The skilled in the art will notice that, obviously, such advantages can be combined with other features, for instance, a multiband response. The skilled in the art will notice that such a multiband response can be obtained within the present invention by adjusting the length and size of the several-coupled arms, together with the spacing and size of the proximity region defined between the several arms. Another way of combining said advantages with a multiband behavior consists of shaping at least one of the arms as a multiband antenna, for instance by means of a multilevel structure or a space-filling structure.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">Depending on the arrangement and application, the arms of the present invention can take the form of any of the prior art antennas, including monopoles, dipoles, planar inverted-F (PIFA) and inverted-F (IFA) structures, microstrip structures, and so on. Therefore, the invention is not limited to the aforementioned antennas. The antenna could be of any other type as long as the antenna includes at least two radiating arms or structures, and that those arms define a close proximity region where the distance between arms reaches a minimum value.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">It will be clear that depending on the antenna embodiment included in the present invention, the resulting antenna would be suitable for several environments. In particular, the antennas can be integrated in handheld terminals (cellular or cordless telephones, PDAs, electronic pagers, electronic games, or remote controls), in cellular or wireless access points (for instance for coverage in micro-cells or pico-cells for systems such as AMPS, GSM850, GSM900, GSM1800, UMTS, PCS1900, DCS, DECT, WLAN, . . . ), in car antennas, in integrated circuit packages or semiconductor devices, in multichip modules, and so on.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">In order to construct a coupled antenna system according to embodiments of the invention, a suitable antenna design is required. Any number of possible configurations exists, and the actual choice of antenna is dependent, for instance, on the operating frequency and bandwidth, among other antenna parameters. Several possible examples of embodiments are listed hereinafter. However, in view of the foregoing description, it will be evident to a person skilled in the art that various modifications may be made within the scope of the invention. In particular, different materials and fabrication processes for producing the coupled antenna system may be selected, which still achieve the desired effects.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">Drawing <b>1</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows in a manner already known in prior-art an antenna system formed by two monopoles, one acting as the active monopole (<b>100</b>) and the other acting as the parasitic monopole (<b>101</b>). The feed point (<b>102</b>), represented with a circle in all the drawings in the present invention, can be implemented in several ways, such a coaxial cable, the sheath of which is coupled to the groundplane, and the inner conductor of which is coupled to the radiating conductive element (<b>100</b>). Parasitic element (<b>101</b>) is connected to groundplane through (<b>103</b>). In this configuration, there is no close proximity region, since both (<b>100</b>) and (<b>101</b>) are in parallel. The radiating conductive element (<b>100</b>) is usually shaped in prior art like a straight wire, but several other shapes can be found in other patents or scientific articles. Shape and dimensions of radiating element (<b>100</b>) and parasitic element (<b>101</b>) will contribute in determining the operating frequency of the overall antenna system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">Drawing <b>2</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows also in a manner known in prior-art an antenna system formed by a radiating element (<b>100</b>) and several parasitic monopoles (<b>104</b>). In this configuration, there is no close proximity region, since both the radiating element (<b>100</b>) and the parasitic elements (<b>104</b>) are in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">Drawing <b>3</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a prior-art configuration known as Yagi-Uda. With this structure, the distance between any pair of dipoles is generally constant, that is, all the dipoles (<b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>) are parallel and no proximity region is included to strength the coupling between dipoles. The object of such a parallel dipole arrangement in the Yagi-Uda antenna is to provide an end-fire, directive radiation pattern, whereas in the present invention the radiating arms are arranged together with the close proximity region to reduce the antenna size yet providing a broadband or multiband behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">Unlike the prior art structures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the newly disclosed coupled antenna system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, Drawing <b>4</b>, is composed by a radiating element (<b>110</b>) connected to a feeding point (represented by (<b>102</b>)) and a parasitic element (<b>111</b>) connected to the groundplane (<b>112</b>) through (<b>103</b>). It is clear in this configuration the close proximity region (<b>200</b>) between folded subpart arms (<b>108</b>) and (<b>109</b>). That is, Ws&#x3c;Wd. Feeding point (<b>102</b>) can be implemented in several ways, such a coaxial cable, the sheath of which is coupled to the groundplane (<b>112</b>), and the inner conductor of which is coupled to the radiating conductive element (<b>110</b>). Shape and dimensions of radiating element (<b>110</b>) and parasitic element (<b>111</b>) will contribute in determining the operating frequency of the overall antenna system. For the sake of clarity but without loss of generality, a particular case is showed in Drawing <b>5</b>. It is composed by a radiating element (<b>100</b>) connected to a feeding point (<b>102</b>), and a parasitic element (<b>113</b>) connected to the groundplane (<b>112</b>) through (<b>103</b>). It is clear in this configuration also that the close proximity region (<b>201</b>) between (<b>100</b>) and (<b>113</b>) contributes to the enhanced performance of the antenna system, and that Ws&#x3c;Wd. It is clear to those skilled in the art that these configurations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> could have been any other type with any size, and being coupled in any other manner as long as the close proximity region is formed, as it will be seen in the following preferred embodiments. For the sake of clarity, the resulting monopole structures are lying on a common flat groundplane, but other conformal configurations upon curved or bent surfaces for both the coupled antennas and the groundplanes could have been used as well. The ground-plane (<b>112</b>) being showed in the drawing is just an example, but several other groundplane embodiments known in the art or from previous patents could have been used, such as multilevel or space-filling groundplanes, or Electromagnetic Band-Gap (EBG) groundplanes, or Photonic Band-Gap (PBG) groundplanes, or high-impedance (Hi-Z) groundplanes. The ground-plane can be disposed on a dielectric substrate. This may be achieved, for instance, by etching techniques as used to produce PCBs, or by using a conductive ink.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">In some preferred embodiments, such as the ones being showed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, only the parasitic elements (<b>114</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>119</b>) are folded so as to form a close proximity region between radiating elements (<b>100</b>) and parasitic elements (<b>114</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>119</b>). Basic configurations (Drawings <b>6</b> to <b>11</b>) are being illustrated in this Figure, where folding of the parasitic elements (<b>114</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>119</b>) is formed by 90-degree angles. The described embodiments of this figure are presented by way of example only and do not limit the invention. Having illustrated and described the principles of the invention in several preferred embodiments thereof, it should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from the close proximity region principle.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">Some embodiments, like the ones being showed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, where space-filling curves are coupled, are preferred when a multiband or broadband behavior is to be enhanced. Said space-filling arrangement allows multiple resonant frequencies which can be used as separate bands or as a broadband if they are properly coupled together. Also, said multiband or broadband behavior can be obtained by shaping said elements with different lengths within the structure. Space-filling curves is also a way to miniaturize further the size of the antenna. For the sake of clarity but without loss of generality, particular configurations are being showed in this figure, where the active elements (that is, the radiating arms) are straight, whereas the space-filling properties have been utilized in the parasitic elements. However, the same space-filling principle could have been used to the radiating elements, as it will be shown in other preferred embodiments described later in this document.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">In some preferred embodiments, such as the ones being showed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, both the parasitic elements (<b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>125</b>, <b>127</b>, <b>129</b>) and the radiating/active elements (<b>120</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>) are folded so as to form a close proximity region between said radiating elements (<b>120</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>) and said parasitic elements (<b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>125</b>, <b>127</b>, <b>129</b>). Basic configurations (Drawings <b>18</b> to <b>23</b>) are being illustrated in this figure, where folding of the parasitic elements (<b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>125</b>, <b>127</b>, <b>129</b>) and radiating elements (<b>120</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>) is formed by 90-degree angles. The described embodiments of this figure are presented by way of example only and do not limit the invention. Having illustrated and described the principles of the invention in several preferred embodiments thereof, it should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from the close proximity region principle.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">For the preferred embodiments showed in Drawings <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>26</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the arms are being formed by means of using inductive stubs (<b>130</b>, <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>133</b>, <b>134</b>). The purpose of those is further reduce the size of the antenna system. The position of said stubs can be placed and distributed along the radiating or the parasitic arms.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0054">In some preferred embodiments, loop configurations for the coupled antennas further help matching the operating frequencies of the antenna system, such as the ones showed in Drawings <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>29</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. From these drawings it can be seen that the overall shape of the antenna system forms an open loop, yet still being within the scope of the present invention without departing from the close proximity region principle.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">To illustrate that several modifications of coupled antenna systems can be done based on the same principle and spirit of the present invention, other preferred embodiment examples are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Drawing <b>30</b> shows a structure where two parasitic elements (<b>135</b>, <b>136</b>) are included, and a close proximity region is being formed between the active element and the parasitic subsystem. Drawings <b>31</b> to <b>35</b> show other preferred configurations where several parasitic elements with different shapes have been placed in different locations and distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0056">Some embodiments, like the ones being showed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, where space-filling curves are coupled, are preferred when a multiband or broadband behavior is to be enhanced. Said space-filling arrangement allows multiple resonant frequencies which can be used as separate bands or as a broadband if they are properly coupled together. Also, said multiband or broadband behavior can be obtained by shaping said elements with different lengths within the structure. Space-filling curves is also a way to miniaturize further the size of the antenna. For the sake of clarity but without loss of generality, particular configurations are being showed in this figure, where the both the active elements (that is, the radiating arms) and the parasitic elements are being formed by means of space-filling curves.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057">In some preferred embodiments, sub-branches to the parasitic and the active elements need to be added so as to match the frequency response of the antenna to the required specifications. Drawing <b>42</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a configuration where a branch (<b>137</b>) has been added to the active element, and another branch (<b>138</b>) has been added to the parasitic element. The shape and size of the branch could be of any type, such as linear, planar or volumetric, without loss of generality. Drawings <b>43</b> to <b>47</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> show other examples of coupled antennas with a branch-like configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">It is interesting to notice that the advantage of the coupled antenna geometry can be used in shaping the radiating elements and the parasitic elements in very complex ways. Particular examples of coupled antennas using complex configuration and designs are being showed in Drawings <b>48</b> to <b>53</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, but it appears clear to any skilled in the art that many other geometries could be used instead within the same spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">The shape and size of the arms could be of any type, such as linear, planar or volumetric, without loss of generality. Drawings <b>54</b> to <b>59</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> show several examples of coupled antennas where shape of both radiating and parasitic elements varies within the same element.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows that not only linear structures can be adapted to meet the close proximity region principle defined in the scope of this invention. Drawing <b>60</b> shows an example of two planar elements (<b>143</b>, <b>144</b>). Drawing <b>62</b> shows an example of a multilevel structure acting as the radiating element. Drawing <b>63</b> shows a spiral active arm surrounding the parasitic arm. Drawing <b>64</b> shows another example of planar arms folded. Not only linear or planar structures are covered within the scope of the present invention, as seen in Drawing <b>65</b>, where two 3D arms are positioned so as to form a close proximity region.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows that not only monopoles or dipoles can feature a close proximity region, but also slot antennas, such as the ones showed in Drawings <b>66</b> and <b>67</b>. Both drawings are being composed by a conventional solid surface ground-plane (<b>151</b>) that has been cut-out so as to have some slots on it (<b>152</b>, <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>). The feedpoint (<b>155</b>) can be implemented in several ways, such as a coaxial cable, the sheath (<b>153</b>) of which is connected to the external part of (<b>151</b>), and the inner conductor (<b>154</b>) of the coaxial cable is coupled to the inner radiating conductive element, as shown in Drawing <b>66</b>. In the case of Drawing <b>67</b>, the inner conductor of the coaxial cable would be connected to (<b>157</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">Another preferred embodiment of coupled antennas is the one being showed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The Drawing represents a coupled antenna being placed in an IC (or chip) module, and is composed by a top cover (<b>159</b>), by an transmit/receive IC module (<b>163</b>), by bond wires (<b>162</b>), by the lead frame of the chip (<b>164</b>), and by a coupled antenna, being formed by an active element and a parasitic element (<b>160</b>, <b>161</b>). Any other type of chip technology could been used without loss of generality.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows different configurations of handheld applications where coupled antennas, as described in the present invention, can be used. Drawing <b>70</b> shows a PCB (<b>167</b>) of a handheld device (for instance, a cell phone) that acts as groundplane. Just for the sake of clarity, the antenna system in this example is formed by two arms, one acting as active (<b>165</b>), that is, connected to the feeding point, and the other one acting as parasitic (<b>166</b>). Drawing <b>71</b> shows a clamshell configuration (also known as flip-type) for a cell phone device, and where the antenna system presented in this invention could be located at. Drawing <b>72</b> shows a PCB (<b>172</b>) of a handheld device (for instance, a cell phone) that acts as groundplane. The antenna system in this example is formed by two arms that are, in this specific case, 3D structures, once acting as the active arm (<b>171</b>) and the other one acting as the parasitic arm (<b>170</b>). Here, the arms (<b>170</b>, <b>171</b>) of the antenna system are presented as a parallelepipeds, but any other structure can be obviously taken instead.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0064">Another preferred embodiment is the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, where the coupled antenna system (<b>173</b>, <b>174</b>) is mounted on or in a car.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, Drawing <b>74</b> shows a PIFA structure that is being composed by an active element formed by groundplane (<b>176</b>), a feeding point (<b>177</b>) coupled somewhere on the patch (<b>178</b>) depending upon the desired input impedance, a grounding or shorting point connection (<b>175</b>), and a radiator element (<b>178</b>). Also, the system is being formed by a parasitic element (<b>179</b>) that is connected to groundplane as well (<b>181</b>). In Drawing <b>74</b> it can be clearly seen that the close proximity region is formed by elements (<b>178</b>) and (<b>179</b>). PIFA antennas have become a hot topic lately due to having a form that can be integrated into the per se known type of handset cabinets. Preferably, for this type of antenna system, the antenna, the ground-plane or both are disposed on a dielectric substrate. This may be achieved, for instance, by etching techniques as used to produce PCBs, or by printing the antenna and the ground-plane onto the substrate using a conductive ink. A low-loss dielectric substrate (such as glass-fibre, a Teflon substrate such as Cuclad&#xae; or other commercial materials such as Rogers&#xae; 4003 well-known in the art) can be placed between said patches and ground-plane. Other dielectric materials with similar properties may be substituted above without departing from the intent of the present invention. As an alternative way to etching the antenna and the ground-plane out of copper or any other metal, it is also possible to manufacture the antenna system by printing it using conductive ink. The antenna feeding scheme can be taken to be any of the well-known schemes used in prior art patch or PIFA antennas as well, for instance: a coaxial cable with the outer conductor connected to the ground-plane and the inner conductor connected to the patch at the desired input resistance point; a microstrip transmission line sharing the same ground-plane as the antenna with the strip capacitively coupled to the patch and located at a distance below the patch, or in another embodiment with the strip placed below the ground-plane and coupled to the patch through a slot, and even a microstrip transmission line with the strip co-planar to the patch. All these mechanisms are well known from prior art and do not constitute an essential part of the present invention. The essential part of the present invention is the shape of the proximity close region, which contributes to reducing the size with respect to prior art configurations, as well as enhancing antenna bandwidth, VSWR, and radiation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0066">Drawings <b>75</b> to <b>77</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> show configurations of coupled antennas as described in the object of the present invention, but with balanced feeding points (<b>183</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0067">The above-described embodiments of the invention are presented by way of example only and do not limit the invention. Having illustrated and described the principles of our invention in several preferred embodiments thereof, it should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an improved vehicle-mounted apparatus and the method of controlling the same. More specifically, the present invention relates to an improvement in operability of the vehicle-mounted apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, a car audio player system, a car navigation system, or the combination thereof are known as equipment to be mounted on the moving body such as an automotive vehicle (herein after referred to as vehicle-mounted apparatus). The car audio player system is AV (audio visual) equipment also referred to as a car audio player for receiving radio or television, or for replaying music compact disks. The car navigation system guides the driver through the optimum path from the present location to the destination specified by the driver while calculating the present location by GPS or autonomous navigation, which is also referred to as a car navigation or car navigator.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This type of vehicle-mounted apparatus is attached on the dashboard of the automotive vehicle. However, since the space available in the interior of the car and the size of the vehicle-mounted apparatus are limited, the features such as a car navigator or a car audio player are formed in an apparatus and shares a single liquid crystal display and/or a single system loudspeaker so as to be switched between these two functions when used. More than one functions are allocated to the same operating switch for the respective features such as a car navigator and a car audio player.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The apparatus herein means a component that functions with organic integrity. For example, it includes the case where the GPS antenna unit and the CD automatic changer unit are separately installed on each section of the vehicle and interconnected by the signal cable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the vehicle-mounted apparatus described above, the contents shown on the display are switched depending on the user's selection. For example, when the car navigator is selected, a road map supplied by the car navigator is shown, and when the car audio player is selected, the display is changed into the animation display of the graphic equalizer supplied by the car audio player. Since the sound source of the audio player (hereinafter referred to as source) can be switched independently of the contents shown on the display, the user can listen to the radio while viewing a map screen of the car navigator.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the conventional vehicle-mounted apparatus has a single display for an apparatus, when two screens displays are required, a single display is subdivided into two screens. The function indications of the operation switches such as keys or the press buttons that have more than one functions are not differentiated by the states such as the car navigator in service, or the audio in service, but a plurality of functions are marked on the key or the location in the vicinity thereof. In addition, in conventional equipment, since the contents displayed on the screen is changed according to the function in service as described above, when the user wants to know the state of audio source while the display is showing the car navigator screen or the TV screen, the user has to access the specific screen first and then operate on that screen. Conventionally, the changeover of the sources has been made by key control, and the technique to change the source in synchronous with the operation of some mechanism, that is, a physical mechanism has not been known.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the related art described above, there is a problem in that the operation is complicated because information from a plurality of systems has to be handled. In other words, since an apparatus has only a single display, in the case where the user wants to operate the audio while the car navigator screen is being displayed, the user has to switchover the screen every time, and thus the operating procedure becomes complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the prior art, since many keys have more than one function allocated, it is difficult to discriminate which action is allocated to which key among a plurality of keys, and thus the operation is difficult to understand. In the prior art, since the contents shown on the display is switched depending on the function in service, it is difficult to display information from a plurality of systems clearly because the state of audio is not known while the car navigator screen is being displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In conventional equipment, though the operation of the physical mechanism such as adjustment of the angle of the panel display could be made, such a physical operation and the switchover of the source as described above are not linked. Therefore, the key operation for switching over the source and the physical operation of the panel have to be made separately, and thus improvement of the operability has been potentially expected.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With these problems of the related art in view, it is an object of the present invention to provide a vehicle-mounted apparatus that can handle information from more than one systems easily and the method of controlling the same. It is another object of the present invention to provide a vehicle-mounted apparatus that is easy to operate and the method of controlling the same.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The illumination varying section <b>56</b> is means for varying the function indication of the operating switch SW<b>1</b> such as the button B according to the predetermined conditions. More specifically, it controls the illumination <b>57</b> such as a LED illumination based on the state of the detecting switch SW<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">[2. Operation]</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The embodiment as described thus far is operated as follows.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">[2-1. Storage Mode]</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a state in which the sub panel <b>2</b> is closed on the main panel <b>1</b> with the button B on the sub panel <b>2</b> facing toward the user is referred to as Storage Mode. In such a Storage Mode, the button B on the back surface of the sub panel serves as an audio operating key, and enables the control of the function of the car audio player such as the selection of the radio station or an adjustment of the sound quality by the action of the main processing section <b>51</b> and the audio controlling section <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this Storage Mode, the user can view a part of the main display D on the right side of the sub panel <b>2</b>, in other words, the right part of the main display D<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), on which the state of the source of the audio player, that is, the station, the name of the station, and the frequency being received via the radio, or the track No., the elapsed time being played by the CD or the MD may be displayed in reduced sizes.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">[2-2. Dual Display Mode]</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the sub panel <b>2</b> is opened from the Storage Mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the main display D<b>1</b> and the sub display D<b>2</b> are aligned side by side (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). This state is referred to as Dual Display Mode, in which the car navigator screen, the TV screen, or the audio control screen is shown on the main display <b>1</b>, while other information such as a simplified map for the car navigator, a screen or the audio control may be shown in a small screen on the sub display D<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Even when the sub panel <b>2</b> is opened, since the rotational angle that defines the angle of the sub panel <b>2</b> may be freely controlled by the action of the hinged portion H or the brake torque, the user can easily set the sub panel <b>2</b> to the position and angle in which the user can easily view the image on the display, and the angle of the sub panel <b>2</b> cannot be changed easily due to vibrations or inclination that may be caused by driving of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">[2-3. Formation Key Mode]</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the sub panel <b>2</b> is further rotated upside down from Dual Display Mode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), the button B is aligned on the left side of the main display D<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). This state is referred to as Formation Key Mode.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the sub panel <b>2</b> is rotated upside down, in the sub panel <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>), the journal for upside down rotation J integral with the hinge base HB rotates with respect to the sub panel <b>2</b>. This rotating force makes the slide plate SP slide via the first gear JG and the axis rack JR, and the sliding force in turn rotates the button B by the button rack BR and the second gear BJ of each button B.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Consequently, when the sub panel <b>2</b> is rotated upside down by 180&#xb0;, each button B rotates upside down by 180&#xb0; as well, and thus the marking of the function on the button will never be inversed. Therefore, the marking on each button is always oriented in the normal direction irrespective of whether the sub panel <b>2</b> is reversed or not.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In Formation Key Mode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the main display D<b>1</b> displays the audio control screen, the car navigator screen, the TV screen by the action of the main controlling section <b>51</b>. The sub panel <b>2</b> may show the function of each button corresponding to the display on the main display D<b>1</b> by varying the illumination <b>57</b> of the LED illumination by the action of the illumination varying section <b>56</b> so as to enable the mode control.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">[2-4. Over Display Mode]</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the sub panel <b>2</b> is closed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) from Formation Key Mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the sub display D<b>2</b> is overlapped on the main display D<b>1</b> and thus the use can view a part, that is, the right portion of the main display D<b>1</b>, in addition to the sub display D<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). This state is referred to as Over Display Mode.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this state of over display, for example, it is possible that the sub display D<b>2</b> show a simplified map of the car navigator and the main display D<b>1</b> shows the operating panel for various functions, or as the Storage Mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it is also possible that the portion of the main display D<b>1</b> exposed on the right side of the sub panel <b>2</b> show the state of the audio source by the action of the source display section <b>55</b> in a reduced size.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">[2-5. Switchover of the Screen and the Source]</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The contents displayed on the main display D<b>1</b> and the sub display D<b>2</b> for each state described above are controlled by the clicking mechanism, the detecting switch, the main processing section <b>51</b>, the main display section <b>52</b>, and the source display section <b>55</b>. In this case, the kind of movement or the position of the sub panel <b>2</b> to be detected, the type of the detecting switch to be used, or how to detect them in terms of the open/close movement and the upside down rotation, and the contents to be displayed are determined freely by the user. Considering the states as described above, there is shown an example.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The position where the sub panel <b>2</b> is closed on the main display D<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is designated to be zero degree as a clicking position, and the position where the sub panel <b>2</b> is opened (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is designated to be 180 degrees. In this case, the detecting switch SW<b>2</b> detects that the sub panel <b>2</b> reaches these clicking positions of zero degree and 180 degrees, and when it is at the position of zero degree, the main display D<b>1</b> shows information on the state of the audio source in the form of a small screen in the exposed portion on the right side. This corresponds to the Storage Mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and Over Display Mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">On the other hand, at the position of 180 degrees, each push button B is used as a mode key for switching the Mode of operation to control the contents displayed on the screen corresponding to the selected mode, which is Formation Key Mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">By the action of the switching section <b>54</b>, the open/close movement or the upside down rotation of the sub panel <b>2</b> is detected by the detecting switch SW<b>2</b> when the sub panel <b>2</b> reaches to the predetermined angles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), and when detected, the audio source is switched according to the predetermined conditions and the priority.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">[3. Effect]</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As described thus far, in this embodiment, various uses are possible such that different information are shown on the two different displays D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> by the open/close movement of the sub display <b>2</b> from/on the main display by the hinge H on the side of these displays, thereby being adaptable to the diversification of displayed contents and the improvement of the functions, which are expected in the future.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this embodiment, since the sub display D<b>2</b> rotates upside down in addition to the horizontal open/close movement, the possible state of use increases. In other words, the state of the second display with respect to the main display D<b>1</b> which is facing toward the user can be changed among the state in which the second display covers the main display D<b>1</b> with the display side facing toward the user (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), the state in which the second display covers the main display with the back side facing toward the user (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), the state in which the second display is aligned with the main display D<b>1</b> side by side with the display side facing toward the user (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), and the state in which the second display is aligned with the main display D<b>1</b> with the back side facing toward the user (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). By combining the state being inclined and stopped half way of the open/close movement or the upside down rotation, very diversified states of use is realized.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this embodiment, since the functions of the operating switch which changes according to the states such as the car navigator mode or the car audio player mode are easily identified by changing the marking of the function by ON/OFF of the illumination or by changing the color of illumination by the action of the illumination varying section <b>56</b>, the operability of the vehicle-mounted apparatus is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this embodiment having the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, when the sub display D<b>2</b> is rotated upside down by 180&#xb0;, the marking of the function on each button B is rotated as well so that the marking is not inversed but shown in the normal orientation, whereby the function of each button B can be easily identified and the operability is improved. Especially, in this embodiment, this function can be realized by a simple mechanism of gears and racks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this embodiment, by displaying the state of the source currently selected/connected on one of the main display D<b>1</b> and the sub display<b>7</b> D<b>2</b> by the action of the source display section <b>55</b>, the audio source can be checked even when the car navigation screen or the TV screen is being displayed. By displaying the state of the source currently selected/connected on the sub display D<b>2</b>, the audio source can be checked even when the car navigator screen or the TV screen are being displayed on the main display D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In this embodiment, the source is switched by the close/open movement or the rotation of the sub display D<b>2</b> by the action of the detecting switches SW<b>2</b> and the switching section <b>54</b>, the operability is improved.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">[4. Other Embodiments]</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above, but it may include other embodiments shown below. For example, the present invention may be applied not only to the automotive vehicle, but also to the vehicle-mounted apparatus to be mounted on other mobile bodies such as the motorbike. The hinge H is located on the left side of the main panel <b>1</b> in the embodiment described thus far, the hinged portion H may be on the right side of the main panel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The size of the sub panel may be freely determined. For example, it may be the size that covers whole part of the main display D<b>1</b> when closed as a theft-prevention measure. It is also possible to combine the present invention with the functions other than the car navigation or the car audio player.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The upside down rotation of the sub panel <b>2</b>, change in marking of the function according to the prescribed conditions, the upside down rotation of the button corresponding to the upside down rotation of the sub panel <b>2</b>, the display of the audio source, switchover of the audio source by the operation of the sub panel <b>2</b> are not mandatory, but any combinations thereof are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It is also possible to rotate only the part of the marking, but not the whole part of the button. The upside down rotation of the marking of the function does not have to be made by the mechanical mechanism, but may be realized by rotating the contents shown in the liquid crystal display by 180&#xb0;. The mechanism to rotate the button in accordance with the upside down rotation of the sub panel <b>2</b> may be implemented not by the rack shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, but by other mechanisms such as a crank mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As is described thus far, according to the present invention, since a vehicle-mounted apparatus that can handle information from a plurality of systems easily and the method of controlling the same are presented, the vehicle-mounted apparatus can be used more conveniently.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to defect inspection devices, and specifically to defect inspection devices using radiation that is incident at more than one angle.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Detecting defects on the surface of wafers produced in the semi-conducting industry is a critical part of the whole production process. In one type of inspection process for such defect detection, a light beam is focused at a normal angle onto the surface, and the normal reflection from the surface is used to determine the presence of a defect. In some inspection processes, it is advantageous to inspect the surface using light that is incident at an oblique angle to the surface, and to detect the light at the oblique angle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Patent Application 2004/0263834 to Alumot et al., whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a method and apparatus for inspecting a surface for defects by first inspecting the surface at a high speed low resolution. Suspect areas are then inspected at a low speed high resolution. Inspections may be performed by illuminating the surface normally, and measuring returning light at an oblique angle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Patent Application 2003/0001120 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,797,975, both to Nishiyama et al., whose disclosures are incorporated herein by reference, describe apparatus for inspecting a semiconductor device for defects. The apparatus includes an oblique illumination system, and a detector unit that receives returning light at a normal angle. The apparatus also includes auto-focus illumination and receiver units which are aligned obliquely to a surface of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,856,384 to Rovira, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a metrology tool for measuring step heights of a sample on a surface. The tool may use normal and oblique illumination and detection of returning light, and may incorporate an auto-focus mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,853,446 to Almogy et al., whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, describes a variable angle inspection system. A scanning light beam may illuminate a surface at a first angle, and a deflection element may be selectively inserted into a path of the scanning beam so that the beam illuminates the surface at a second angle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The light inspecting the wafer surface is typically maintained in focus at the surface by an auto-focus mechanism, many of which are known in the art. One such mechanism is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,124,924 to Feldman et al., whose disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. The disclosure uses the property that in-focus light returns from a region whereon the light is focused in the form of a generally plane wave front. In contrast, out-of-focus light returns from the region in the form of a generally spherical wave front. The disclosure describes a double slit system which is configured so that when the region is in focus images of the slits align, whereas when the region is out of focus the images are misaligned.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In embodiments of the present invention, apparatus for inspection of a surface comprises an objective component and first and second periscopes. The objective component, typically an objective lens, has central and peripheral regions, and is positioned so that it focuses an input radiation beam through its central region onto the surface, so that the input radiation beam strikes the surface in a normal direction. The first periscope is movable to a first position where it diverts the input beam to pass through the peripheral region of the objective component, so that the component focuses the input beam to strike the surface in an oblique direction. The second periscope, typically fixedly coupled to the first periscope, is movable to a second position where it captures reflected radiation travelling in the oblique direction from the surface, after the reflected radiation has passed through the peripheral region of the objective. The two movable periscopes allow the apparatus to irradiate the surface normally or obliquely via the same objective component.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Typically, the second periscope diverts the reflected radiation along a return path which is substantially parallel to and contiguous with an incoming path of the input beam prior to its diversion by the first periscope. In this case, the apparatus may advantageously be incorporated into an inspection system which operates in one of two modes. In a first mode the periscopes are positioned so as not to interact with the input radiation beam or the reflected radiation, the input radiation beam is directed via the central region of the objective component so as to strike a location on the surface normally, and the reflected radiation traverses substantially the same incoming path as the input beam. In a second mode the periscopes are positioned in their respective positions, so as to direct the input radiation beam to the location at an oblique angle to the surface, and so that the reflected radiation traverses the contiguous parallel return path described above.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In each mode the reflected radiation may be advantageously used for auto-focusing and for detection of a characteristic, such as the presence of an impurity at the location or of a defect of the location. Furthermore, since in both modes the input beam and the reflected radiation follow generally the same paths, there is substantially no requirement to change configurations of detection and/or auto-focus optics comprised in the inspection system when switching modes.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention will be more fully understood from the following detailed description of the embodiments thereof, taken together with the drawings, a brief description of which follows.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, which are schematic illustrations of different modes of operation of an optical inspection apparatus <b>10</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a first irradiation mode, hereinbelow termed a normal irradiation mode or a normal mode, wherein the apparatus irradiates a wafer <b>26</b> normally; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a second mode, hereinbelow termed an oblique irradiation mode or an oblique mode, wherein the wafer is irradiated obliquely. Apparatus <b>10</b> comprises a source <b>12</b>, typically a laser source, which is adapted to generate a radiation beam that is focused to a spot <b>13</b> on a surface <b>25</b> of wafer <b>26</b>. Apparatus <b>10</b> typically uses an auto-focus system <b>74</b> that generates a substantially similar auto-focus (AF) signal in both normal and oblique irradiation modes. Auto-focus system <b>74</b> consists of a beam splitter <b>104</b> and an auto-focus camera <b>108</b>. A number of such auto-focus systems are known in the art, any suitable one of which may be used in embodiments of the present invention. An auto-focus system which may be advantageously used is described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/903,125, titled &#x201c;Determination of Irradiation Parameters for Inspection of a Surface,&#x201d; is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and is incorporated herein by reference. application Ser. No. 10/903,125 includes a description of elements similar to those comprised in the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Apparatus <b>10</b> thus acts as an irradiation system that is able to irradiate surface <b>25</b> normally or obliquely, and that may use the same auto-focus system in both modes of irradiation. In an embodiment of the present invention, source <b>12</b> comprises a solid state diode laser generating continuous radiation at 532 nm. Unless otherwise stated herein, surface <b>25</b> is assumed to lie in an x-y plane, where an x-axis is in the plane of the paper, and a y-axis is out of the plane of the paper. Thus, in the normal irradiation mode, a path of radiation from source <b>12</b> to spot <b>13</b> is generally parallel to a z-axis, i.e., is typically incident normal to surface <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Apparatus <b>10</b> is used to inspect surface <b>25</b>, by having spot <b>13</b> traverse the surface of the wafer. Methods for scanning spot <b>13</b> across surface <b>25</b> are known in the art. Typically the methods incorporate devices, such as acousto-optic modulators, which may be coupled to move the spot, the wafer, or both, in a controlled manner. The scan devices are controlled by a controller <b>60</b>, which also controls the operation of apparatus <b>10</b>. For clarity, devices for scanning spot <b>13</b> across surface <b>25</b> are omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">To produce spot <b>13</b>, radiation from source <b>12</b> is passed through a linear polarizer <b>14</b>, which typically has an extinction ratio better than 200:1 and a transmission better than 98% for the transmitted linearly polarized radiation it produces. Polarizer <b>14</b> may advantageously be implemented from a glass plate set at the Brewster angle for the glass. Polarizer <b>14</b> outputs linearly polarized radiation having a polarization direction in the x-y plane, the polarization direction hereinbelow, unless otherwise stated, being assumed to be parallel to the x-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The beam from polarizer <b>14</b> passes through a spot size controller wheel <b>70</b>, which selects a size of the beam to be used, according to the mode of operation of apparatus <b>10</b>. In the normal mode illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, controller <b>60</b> rotates wheel <b>70</b> so that the beam passes through a normal mode aperture <b>72</b> having a normal mode diameter, assumed herein by way of example to be approximately 10 mm. Thus, in the normal mode, a beam <b>71</b> having a diameter of approximately 10 mm exits aperture <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the oblique mode illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the controller rotates wheel <b>70</b> so that the beam passes through an oblique mode aperture <b>82</b> having a reduced diameter compared to the diameter of the normal mode beam. By way of example, oblique mode aperture <b>82</b> is assumed herein to have an approximate diameter of 7 mm. Thus, in the oblique mode, a beam <b>73</b> having a diameter of approximately 7 mm exits aperture <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Linearly polarized radiation beam <b>71</b> or <b>73</b> passes through a non-polarizing beam splitter <b>18</b>, which typically reflects approximately 20% of the incident radiation to a beam dump <b>16</b>, and transmits approximately 80% of the incident radiation as linearly polarized radiation to a quarter-wave plate <b>20</b>. The inventors have found that the 80/20 transmission/reflection ratio for beam splitter <b>18</b> provides a satisfactory compromise between reflected radiation requirements of auto-focus system <b>74</b> and preference for maximum irradiation power on the wafer. It will be appreciated, however, that any other suitable transmission/reflection ratio may be used. Plate <b>20</b> is oriented so that its mechanical axis of symmetry, normal to the plane of the plate, is typically tilted at about 5&#xb0; to the z-axis, to prevent stray reflections interfering with the operation of apparatus <b>10</b>. The plate is coupled to a motor <b>38</b> that is controlled by controller <b>60</b>, so that the motor is able to orient the plate in a controlled manner about its axis.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An optic axis <b>15</b> of plate <b>20</b> lies in the plane of the plate. Depending on the angle made by optic axis <b>15</b> with the polarization direction&#x2014;the x-axis&#x2014;of the incoming radiation, and assuming the angle to be non-zero, motor <b>38</b> may set the radiation exiting from the plate to be left- or right-circularly or elliptically polarized. If the angle made by optic axis <b>15</b> with the polarization direction is zero, then the radiation exiting plate <b>20</b> is linearly polarized along the x-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The radiation exiting from plate <b>20</b> is transmitted to a half-wave plate <b>22</b>, oriented with its mechanical axis, normal to the plane of the plate, typically tilted at about 5&#xb0; to the z-axis to neutralize the effect of stray reflections. Plate <b>22</b> is coupled to a motor <b>40</b> that is controlled by controller <b>60</b> and that is able to orient the plate about its axis. An optic axis <b>23</b> of plate <b>22</b> lies in the plane of the plate. Half-wave plate <b>22</b> acts on radiation incident on the plate according to the type of polarization of the incident radiation, and according to the angle made by the direction of polarization of the incident radiation with optic axis <b>23</b>. If the incident radiation is linearly polarized, plate <b>22</b> rotates the direction of polarization by 2&#x3b8;, where &#x3b8; is the angle between the plate's optic axis and the incident radiation's direction of polarization. If the incident radiation is elliptically polarized, plate <b>22</b> rotates the axes of the ellipse by 2&#x3b8;.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The effective angle of polarization (&#x3b8;) and ellipticity e of the radiation exiting the combination of plates <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are given by equations (1):</p>

are the respective angles between the half-wave plate and quarter-wave plate fast axes and the incoming polarization orientation.
</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It will be appreciated that the combination of rotatable quarter-wave plate <b>20</b> and rotatable half-wave plate <b>22</b> gives complete control over the type of polarization of radiation transmitted from the half-wave plate, given incident linearly polarized radiation. The combination is also referred to hereinbelow as polarization controlling mechanism <b>27</b>. It will also be appreciated that mechanism <b>27</b> acts as an adjustable polarizer between source <b>12</b> and surface <b>25</b>. It will further be appreciated that while the description of mechanism <b>27</b> refers to rotation of half and quarter wave plates, electro-optic materials or other electrically active retarders may be used in place of plates <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> to provide the same continuously variable polarization as is provided by mechanism <b>27</b>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that mechanism <b>27</b>, and any other system used to generate continuously variable polarization, has to meet certain system constraints, such as ability to withstand high radiation power densities generated by the irradiating source.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Radiation from plate <b>22</b> passes through a hole <b>47</b> in a mirror <b>46</b> oriented at 45&#xb0; to the z-axis. Hole <b>47</b> is typically in the form of an ellipse that subtends, at the x-y plane, a circle approximately equal in diameter to the normal mode beam diameter, i.e., 10 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the normal mode of operation, after traversing hole <b>47</b>, beam <b>71</b> passes through a rotatable turret <b>84</b> which incorporates a number of different lenses. Controller <b>60</b> operates the turret and is able to select which lenses in the turret are in the path of beam <b>71</b> after it has passed through hole <b>47</b>. The selected lenses, together with an objective component <b>24</b>, allow the controller to set different numerical apertures (NAs), corresponding to different magnifications, for a beam focused to spot <b>13</b> on surface <b>25</b>, thus irradiating a region <b>35</b> of the surface with respective cones of different half-angles, the axis of the cones being normal to surface <b>25</b>. Except where otherwise stated, component <b>24</b> is hereinbelow assumed by way of example to comprise a converging lens, and is also referred to below as objective <b>24</b>. Herein, by way of example, it is assumed that controller <b>60</b> may rotate turret <b>84</b> to one of a number of positions, each generating a different magnification at surface <b>25</b>, one of the magnifications being approximately 4&#xd7; and another approximately 5&#xd7;. In the normal mode of operation, objective <b>24</b> conveys beam <b>71</b> to region <b>35</b> via a central region <b>37</b> of the objective. It will be understood that the radiation focused on region <b>35</b> has substantially the same polarization as that output by polarization controlling mechanism <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the oblique mode of operation, controller <b>60</b> inserts a beam diverter <b>86</b> into the path of beam <b>73</b> after hole <b>47</b>, and rotates turret <b>84</b> to the approximately 4&#xd7; or the approximately 5&#xd7; magnification position. The diverter is positioned between mirror <b>46</b> and turret <b>84</b>, and is typically inserted into its position, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, by controller <b>60</b> operating a pneumatic arm to which the diverter is coupled. (In the normal mode of operation, controller <b>60</b> operates the pneumatic arm to remove diverter <b>86</b> from the beam path, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.) For clarity, the pneumatic arm moving diverter <b>86</b> is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>; it will also be appreciated that any other system known in the art may be used to position diverter <b>86</b> in and out of the beam path, and that all such systems are assumed to be comprised within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the operation and construction of diverter <b>86</b> in apparatus <b>10</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. For clarity, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> some elements of apparatus <b>10</b> have been omitted. Diverter <b>86</b> comprises a first periscope <b>88</b>, which acts to divert incoming beam <b>73</b> that is produced by aperture <b>82</b> and that passes through hole <b>47</b>. In the specification and in the claims, a periscope is to be understood as at least one optical element which transversely diverts a radiation beam from an initial path to a substantially parallel path in the same direction. In a disclosed embodiment of the present invention, periscope <b>88</b> is configured as a single monolithic element, typically comprising parallel reflecting facets <b>89</b> and <b>91</b>, the facets typically being totally internally reflecting facets, and parallel entrance and exit facets <b>87</b> and <b>93</b>. Periscope <b>88</b> diverts incoming beam <b>73</b> from its original path parallel to the z-axis, indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by a broken line <b>90</b>, to a new translated beam path <b>92</b> also parallel to the z-axis. Typically, the distance between the original path and new beam path <b>92</b> is of the order of 20 mm; by way of example the distance is herein assumed to be approximately 22 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The lenses in turret <b>84</b> act as relays, conveying the beam to a peripheral region <b>95</b> of objective <b>24</b> and the objective then diverts the beam from its path <b>92</b> to a converging tilted beam <b>94</b>, and focuses the tilted beam to spot <b>13</b> in region <b>35</b>. Region <b>35</b> is thus irradiated obliquely. If turret <b>84</b> is set to its 4&#xd7; position, tilted beam <b>94</b> irradiates region <b>35</b> at an angle &#x3b1; from the normal to surface <b>25</b> approximately equal to 22&#xb0;; if the turret is set to its 5&#xd7; position, &#x3b1; is approximately equal to 35&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Tilted beam <b>94</b> is specularly reflected from region <b>35</b>, at angle &#x3b1;, to a diverging reflected beam <b>96</b>, which is converted at peripheral region <b>95</b> of objective <b>24</b>, and by the lenses in turret <b>84</b>, to a substantially collimated beam <b>98</b> parallel to the z-axis. A second periscope <b>100</b> comprised in diverter <b>86</b> translates beam <b>98</b> to a return collimated beam <b>102</b> which passes through hole <b>47</b>, via plates <b>22</b> and <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>) to beam splitter <b>18</b>. Beam splitter <b>18</b> reflects approximately 20% of the radiation incident on the beam splitter, to beam splitter <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As described above, diverter <b>86</b> comprises two periscopes, which each translate an initial path of an incoming beam to a subsequent path. The translations provided by each periscope are approximately equal.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Dimensions of beams <b>73</b> and <b>102</b>, and corresponding dimensions of periscopes <b>88</b> and <b>100</b>, are chosen so that both beams <b>73</b> and <b>102</b> pass through hole <b>47</b>. Thus, for the exemplary diameter of approximately 7 mm for beam <b>73</b>, periscope <b>100</b> may be configured to form beam <b>102</b> with an approximate diameter of 3 mm. The inventors have found that this ratio of diameters provides good irradiation of surface <b>25</b> and sufficient return radiation for a bright field channel signal and auto-focus system <b>74</b>, described below. Without undue experimentation, those skilled in the art will be able to determine other suitable values for dimensions of beams <b>73</b> and <b>102</b>, including forming those beams to have non-circular cross-sections, the beams being able to traverse hole <b>47</b>. All such dimensions and cross-sections are assumed to be comprised within the scope of the present invention. For example, one or both beams <b>73</b> and <b>102</b> may have cross-sections in the form of segments of a circle. In the disclosed embodiment referred to above, periscope <b>100</b> is configured to be one element having generally the same shape as periscope <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Typically, diverter <b>86</b> is configured so as not to alter the plane of polarization of beams traversing the diverter.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In both the oblique and normal modes of operation, splitter <b>104</b> reflects approximately 10% of the radiation incident on it to auto-focus camera <b>108</b>, which generates an auto-focus (AF) signal that controller <b>60</b> uses to maintain spot <b>13</b> in focus by any suitable auto-focus method known in the art. For example, controller <b>60</b> may translate wafer <b>26</b> parallel to the z-axis; alternatively or additionally, controller may alter the position of diverter <b>86</b> and/or of turret <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment of the present invention, auto-focus system <b>74</b> is generally similar to the system described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,124,924 to Feldman et al. In the normal irradiation mode, system <b>74</b> typically uses a double slit system, as described by Feldman et al., to generate the AF signal. In the oblique irradiation mode, typically one slit is imaged, and the image's misalignment from the in-focus position defined by the double slit system is used to generate the AF signal. It will be appreciated that in this mode, the oblique irradiation through peripheral region <b>95</b> enhances the operation of system <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, in both normal and oblique mode operation, splitter <b>104</b> transmits approximately 50% of the radiation incident on it, via focusing optics <b>34</b>, to a bright field analyzer <b>30</b>, the orientation of which is controlled via controller <b>60</b> by a motor <b>32</b>. Analyzer <b>30</b>, and other analyzers referred to herein, act as adjustable polarizers to filter and linearly polarize incident radiation, as is known in the art. The radiation is focused onto a bright field detector <b>36</b>, and the output from detector <b>36</b> is transferred as a bright field channel signal to controller <b>60</b> for analysis, as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In normal mode operation, beam <b>71</b> is specularly reflected from region <b>35</b>, and follows a return path via central region <b>37</b> of objective <b>24</b> and the lenses of turret <b>84</b>, through hole <b>47</b>. From hole <b>47</b> the specularly reflected beam returns on a path substantially as described above for beam <b>102</b>, providing an auto-focus and a bright field channel signal.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Apparatus <b>10</b> divides radiation radiating from region <b>35</b> into two or more fields. In both normal and oblique modes of operation, a first bright field <b>29</b> comprises radiation that is substantially specularly reflected from region <b>35</b>, i.e., that traverses hole <b>47</b> in a return direction. It will be understood that specularly reflected radiation from region <b>35</b> arriving at analyzer <b>30</b> is, to a first approximation, linearly polarized in a direction depending on the orientation of quarter-wave plate <b>20</b>. Thus, analyzer <b>30</b> may be oriented to filter out substantially all the specularly reflected radiation from region <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the normal and oblique modes of operation, a near normal field <b>31</b>, also herein termed a gray field, comprises radiation that is scattered from region <b>35</b> at angles between more than approximately 2&#xb0; and less than approximately 45&#xb0;, the angles being measured with respect to the normal to surface <b>25</b>, and defining a solid angle that field <b>31</b> subtends. Radiation in gray field <b>31</b> is collimated by objective <b>24</b> and is then reflected from mirror <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The radiation reflected from mirror <b>46</b> passes through a first gray field analyzer <b>43</b> to an approximately 50/50 non-polarizing beam-splitter <b>53</b>. Analyzer <b>43</b> is driven by a motor <b>65</b>. The transmitted radiation from beam-splitter <b>53</b> is directed to four substantially similar gray field detectors <b>48</b> (for clarity only two are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>), each detector <b>48</b> receiving radiation from approximately one quarter of field <b>31</b>. The reflected radiation from beam-splitter <b>53</b> is directed via a second gray field analyzer <b>57</b> to a second gray field detector <b>59</b>. Analyzer <b>57</b> is driven by a motor <b>63</b>. For clarity, collimation and focusing optics between mirror <b>46</b> and detectors <b>48</b> and <b>59</b> are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Typically, in the normal mode of apparatus <b>10</b>, either analyzer <b>57</b> or analyzer <b>43</b> is positioned as described above. In a first configuration of apparatus <b>10</b>, analyzer <b>43</b> is in position (so that analyzer <b>57</b> is not in position), and all five gray field detectors receive the same type of polarized radiation. In a second configuration of apparatus <b>10</b>, analyzer <b>57</b> is in position (so that analyzer <b>43</b> is not in position), and only detector <b>59</b> receives polarized radiation. The output signals of detectors <b>48</b> are herein termed GF<b>1</b>, GF<b>2</b>, GF<b>3</b>, and GF<b>4</b>, and the output signal of detector <b>59</b> is herein termed GF_UNION. In one disclosed embodiment, controller <b>60</b> receives GF<b>1</b>, GF<b>2</b>, GF<b>3</b>, GF<b>4</b>, and GF_UNION as five gray field channels in the normal mode. Typically, in the oblique mode, apparatus <b>10</b> is configured to operate in the first configuration, and generates gray field channels GF<b>1</b>, GF<b>2</b>, GF<b>3</b>, and GF<b>4</b>, corresponding to forward, side, and backward scattered signals from region <b>35</b>. In a further disclosed embodiment of the present invention, in the oblique mode controller <b>60</b> receives two of gray channel signal GF<b>1</b>, GF<b>2</b>, GF<b>3</b>, and GF<b>4</b>, corresponding to forward-scattered gray field signals.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In both the oblique and the normal modes of operation, a far field <b>33</b>, also herein termed a dark field, comprises radiation that is scattered from region <b>35</b> at angles to surface <b>25</b> that are between approximately 5&#xb0; and approximately 37&#xb0;, the angles defining a solid angle that field <b>33</b> subtends. The dark field radiation transmits via focusing optics <b>56</b> and through one or more dark field analyzers <b>54</b>, each analyzer having an orientation set by a respective motor <b>52</b>, under the control of controller <b>60</b>. The dark field radiation is focused to a respective dark field detector <b>58</b>. The output from each detector <b>58</b> is transferred to controller <b>60</b>. Each motor <b>52</b>, polarizer <b>54</b>, dark field optics <b>56</b> and detector <b>58</b> is herein collectively termed dark field detection system <b>61</b>. For clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> only show two dark field detection systems <b>61</b>. Typically, apparatus <b>10</b> comprises more than one system <b>61</b>, and is herein assumed by way of example to comprise four dark field detection systems <b>61</b>, each of the systems being disposed symmetrically with respect to region <b>35</b>, typically in azimuth directions corresponding to the four gray field channels. Thus, each system <b>61</b> receives scattered radiation from a portion of the dark field. The output signals of detectors <b>58</b> are termed DF<b>1</b>, DF<b>2</b>, DF<b>3</b>, and DF<b>4</b> and are available to controller <b>60</b> as four dark field channels.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the normal mode of operation, the four dark fields <b>33</b> are substantially symmetrically disposed about beam <b>71</b>. In the oblique mode of operation, the four dark fields are asymmetrically disposed about beam <b>94</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and receive forward-scattered, back-scattered and side-scattered radiation from region <b>35</b>. It will be appreciated that in both the normal and the oblique modes controller <b>60</b> may choose between signals DF<b>1</b>, DF<b>2</b>, DF<b>3</b>, and DF<b>4</b> to optimize measurements used in apparatus <b>10</b>. In the further disclosed embodiment of the present invention referred to above, in the oblique mode controller <b>60</b> may only use the signals corresponding to back-scattered radiation to improve signal to noise measurements of scattered radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Controller <b>60</b> acts as a central processing unit for apparatus <b>10</b>, providing signals to set motors <b>32</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>52</b> as it scans spot <b>13</b> over surface <b>25</b>. Controller <b>60</b> typically comprises one or more analog-digital (A/D) converters which convert analog signals generated by detectors <b>36</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>59</b>, and <b>58</b>, and/or sums from the detectors as described above, to digital values, which are in turn stored in a memory <b>62</b> coupled to the controller.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As stated above, apparatus <b>10</b> may be used to scan surface <b>25</b> so as to locate defects on the surface. A defect typically comprises, but is not limited to, an extraneous particle on surface <b>25</b>, a contaminant on the surface, a short between conductors on the surface, and a break in a conductor. The defect typically causes a difference in polarization characteristics of radiation radiating from the region of the defect, compared to the polarization characteristics of radiation radiating from the same region if no defect is present. The polarization characteristics of radiation from such a &#x201c;non-defect region&#x201d; are typically a function of the polarization characteristics of the irradiating radiation and of the region itself. For example, if the region comprises a patterned region made up of relatively closely spaced parallel conductors, the parallel conductors influence the polarization characteristics of the radiation from the region. Other factors which influence the polarization characteristics of radiation from the region will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/903,125, referenced above, describes apparatus for detecting defects on a surface of a wafer. The application also describes a process to determine settings of elements of the apparatus to be used when regions of the surface are irradiated. The application further describes an exemplary process for examination of the wafer after the settings have been determined. Those skilled in the art will be able to use the application, mutatis mutandis, in order to determine settings of plates <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, and analyzers <b>30</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>57</b> of the present invention, for both the normal and oblique modes of operation of apparatus <b>10</b>, as well as to apply the settings to determine defects on wafer <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">While the description hereinabove has assumed that irradiation of surface <b>25</b> uses generally transparent optic elements, it will be appreciated that the principles of the present invention are not limited to use of such elements. For example, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, objective component <b>24</b> may be configured to comprise at least a partially reflecting mirror. It will thus be appreciated that the embodiments described above are cited by way of example, and that the present invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove. Rather, the scope of the present invention includes both combinations and subcombinations of the various features described hereinabove, as well as variations and modifications thereof which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description and which are not disclosed in the prior art.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for 3 dimensional scanning using a light source for projecting a source of illumination configured to be non-uniform or having a predetermined pattern is disclosed. A CMOS sensor having randomly accessible rows of pixels, and an associated lens system, is mounted above a workpiece, with the workpiece and sensor movable with respect to each other in a scanning relation. Rows of pixels of the sensor are selected for registering reflected light, with data from the selected rows provided to a computer for calculating height information of features of the workpiece. Significantly, both 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional images may be generated during a single scanning pass because of the non-uniform source of light and random access capabilities of the sensor.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to optical measurement systems of surface profiles utilizing optical reflections from a surface under examination, and particularly to such a measurement system wherein a multi-section, structured lighting technique is used to obtain depth information.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Obtaining an accurate three-dimensional profile of a surface for measurement purposes and checking integrity of objects, or parts produced through a process, has been subject to ongoing research and development. Need for quickly measuring size of objects, particularly in three dimensions, stems from stringent requirements for product quality, process control and process monitoring. These needs are driven by increasingly higher manufacturing rates of mass produced goods and continuing miniaturization of components. For example, with respect to electronics manufacturing, requirements for checking size and position of components is extremely critical. Here, a solder paste material used to bond components to printed circuit boards must have a known volumetric size to ensure that electrical and mechanical characteristics of a solder joint meets quality requirements of the product.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Non-contact, three-dimensional measurement techniques are generally preferred over tactile methods because non-contact techniques can be used to inspect electronic components and other delicate parts without touching, or possibly destroying the components or parts to be measured. Moreover, due to high manufacturing rates, speed of measurement is an important feature. For this reason, non-contact, optical techniques have received more acceptance as they are generally faster than other measuring techniques. Among many different optical methods that have been developed, two approaches have become more commonly used than others. A first class of these techniques generally includes triangulation [1-7], and a second class generally includes fringe-based techniques (through Moir&#xe9; or phase-shifting profilometry) [8-2]. Triangulation is a relatively effective technique wherein a beam or sheet of light, often a laser source, is projected obliquely onto a surface being examined and a deformed image of a reflected spot or line is generated and captured using a camera, such as a CCD camera. Deformations of the spot or line are analyzed by using a computer to derive height information. Effectiveness of triangulation is limited to those relatively few applications wherein a reflection from surfaces of objects to be measured is of sufficient intensity for a camera to register an image, but not so intense that over-exposure or &#x201c;blooming&#x201d; of the image occurs. In practice, finding a reasonable compromise of lighting is often difficult, if not an impossible task. This is particularly true in cases where a source of illumination is a laser. For example, electronic parts and printed circuit board assemblies contain objects of widely different reflectivity, such as copper traces, solder paste, metallic objects, solder mask, screen print, plastic-encased components, and other such objects. As such, finding an imaging illumination that will work for all types of reflectivities associated with these components and substances is difficult, and in some instances impossible. Moreover, resolution of triangulation-based systems is primarily proportional to magnification, which in turn depends to some extent on pixel resolution of the camera. To obtain high accuracy, magnification needs to be as high as possible, which in turn demands high pixel resolution. Pixel resolution in turn determines throughput or sampling rate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fringe-based methods derive depth information through manipulation of image intensities obtained from a phase-shifted source of illumination. These methods offer certain advantages over triangulation, such as higher resolution and ability to perform full-field three-dimensional imaging. A main disadvantage of these methods is complexity involved in processing interfrograms or phase-shifted images, such as unwrapping of phase images. Moreover, similar to triangulation, these techniques also require that imaging conditions, particularly illumination intensity, be carefully controlled to avoid underexposure and overexposure of components to be measured. As mentioned above, in complex scenes containing objects of widely differing reflectivity, this is usually impractical.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In contrast to the above-mentioned methods, three-dimensional measurement techniques that use only a reflection of structured lighting have been left generally unexplored, perhaps because of a lack of understanding that intensity variations due to surface reflectivity changes need to be decoupled from intensity variations caused as a result of changes in a surface profile.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One method of relating surface height variations to intensity modulations has been presented in [13] wherein two sources of structured light are used to measure height of components and objects. The two sources of light are arranged such that objects of different heights illuminated by structured light will reflect different levels of light. As a result, intensity of reflected structured light is proportional to height of a surface that reflects the light. However, this method has three main drawbacks, a first of which requiring that the two light sources be identical in output, in turn requiring calibration of the light sources. Second, obtaining a surface profile of objects requires two passes. With each pass, one of the light sources is used to capture an image of the surface. Since the scanning process is a mechanical operation, speed of scanning will certainly be a limiting factor for many applications. Third, the technique suffers from the common problem of underexposed or overexposed images of components due to different surface reflectivity of these components. Of course, it is possible to take numerous passes over a surface, each pass being at a different illumination setting, but this would be impractical for high-speed applications.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention is based on using reflected intensity of a varying intensity pattern projected obliquely onto a surface being profiled. This technique involves scanning a surface under examination in order to develop a three-dimensional map of the surface. Unlike the approach presented in [13], Applicant's method uses a single source of illumination and requires only one pass over a surface under examination, and thus is faster than methods of the prior art. Furthermore, the invention addresses a number of commonly encountered problems, such as underexposed and overexposed images, that have not been solved by methods of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As will be described, Applicant's invention offers the following novel and unique features:</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">High dynamic range: The proposed method can deal with complex scenes containing objects of varying reflectivity without any compromise on measurement resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Combined 2D imaging: The proposed method can be used to construct an imaging device that can produce 2D images of a surface being examined simultaneously with a scanning operation taking place to obtain 3D image data. Furthermore, Applicant's method facilitates static 2D image capture without scanning, in a similar manner as static video capture may be accomplished by a conventional CCTV camera. This is an important feature of the invention as most industrial applications involve a combination of 2D and 3D image data to perform required analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Robust and precise operation: Computation of height and depth values of imaged components is extremely simple and involves only basic mathematical operations to manipulate pixel intensity values. Since Applicant's approach is based principally on light intensity, spatial resolution does not affect elevation measurement accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Multiple resolution and measuring range: A projected structured light pattern can be designed such that the light pattern offers several measuring ranges simultaneously during one scanning operation. This may be combined with other features mentioned above to develop a unique measurement system that may be used for a variety of different applications.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, an intensity pattern or gradient <b>10</b> is developed that has levels of light intensity ranging from a lower intensity level that may simply be dark or unilluminated to establish a zero light reference at <b>12</b> and rises upward in intensity at <b>14</b> to a highest level of intensity at <b>16</b> that is just below a saturation level of pixels registering a bright reflection from a scene being examined. When projected obliquely as shown, the gradient region <b>14</b> may be anywhere from a few microns in width to measure height to a high degree of accuracy, or where such accuracy is not needed then the gradient may be much larger. Such a gradient or pattern may be generated in many different ways, such as coating a transparent sheet material with a graduated coating of opaque material, or by generating a linear light gradient by a computer program and photographing the gradient on a computer monitor. The resulting film negative may then be used to develop gradient <b>14</b>. In such an arrangement, the film is placed in front of a light source, with a projection lens adjacent the film to develop a collimated beam of light containing the gradient. Thus, this intensity pattern, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, is projected over an area <b>18</b> of a workpiece <b>20</b>, the area <b>18</b> being imaged through an imaging lens <b>22</b> of a CCD camera <b>24</b>. An output of camera <b>24</b> is provided to computer <b>26</b> for analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> illustrate a principle of operation of illumination of the present invention. Here, a point, point A, on workpiece <b>20</b> is considered as the workpiece is moved under lens <b>22</b> during a scanning operation. Later, it will be shown how this concept is expanded to obtain surface heights and depths of all points of the workpiece during a scanning operation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, point A is illuminated by light rays <b>24</b> of intensity pattern <b>10</b> having a relatively low or dark intensity value I<sub>0</sub>. This point is initially imaged by the imaging system when point A is at position R<sub>0</sub>. The reflection intensity value of point A produced by the imaging system is recorded by computer <b>26</b> as a value M<sub>0</sub>. As workpiece <b>20</b> is moved during the scanning operation, point A will arrive at position R<sub>1 </sub>where it is illuminated by brighter light rays <b>26</b> of light gradient <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and again imaged by the imaging system. Significantly, a level of light reflected from point A as defined by light gradient <b>14</b> is proportional to height of point A. At this time, point A is illuminated at an illumination level (I<sub>1</sub>) dependent on a point of light gradient <b>14</b>, illustrated by rays <b>26</b>, and its higher intensity value is recorded as M<sub>1</sub>. As the scanning operation continues and the workpiece moves to point R<sub>2</sub>, where the imaging system measures reflected intensity of light rays <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) illuminating point A for a third time and the measured intensity, referred to as M<sub>2</sub>, is recorded. It should be noted that this time, when point A is at position R<sub>2 </sub>within area <b>18</b>, point A is illuminated a brightest intensity <b>16</b> that is reflected by point A at intensity value I<sub>2</sub>. Using intensity values M<sub>0 </sub>and M<sub>2</sub>, an intensity value may be calculated that correlates with average reflectivity of point A. This may be done simply by taking an average of the two readings, as shown in Equation [1] below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>r</i>=(<i>M</i>0+<i>M</i>2)/2&#x2003;&#x2003;[1]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In instances where a light intensity gradient of intensity pattern <b>10</b> projected onto workpiece <b>20</b> is linear, any difference between r and M<sub>1 </sub>is due to the height of Point A. If the point is below a known reference plane (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), point A will appear darker due to light rays striking point A being developed by a less intense region of light gradient <b>14</b>, resulting in the value of r being less than M<b>1</b>. Alternately, if the value of r is larger than M<b>1</b>, then point A must be higher than the reference plane due to light rays striking point A being developed by a more intense region of light gradient <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Assuming that intensity pattern <b>10</b> varies linearly from a lowest value <b>12</b> to a highest value <b>16</b> and that imaging system <b>22</b> has a linear response, then height of any point may be obtained from Equation [2] below:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Height=(<i>M</i><sub>1</sub><i>&#x2212;r</i>)*<i>K</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;[2]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Where K is a constant derived from a calibration procedure, such as placing an object of known height in a field of view of imaging system <b>22</b> and recording values of M<sub>0</sub>, M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2</sub>.
</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">If linearity of the projected pattern and sampling of the imaging device is not possible, then Applicant's technique is still valid but requires a more elaborate calibration procedure wherein non-linearity of an illumination source is accounted for. One possible approach to compensate for such non-linearity of the illumination source is to use a look-up-table holding a plurality of values for K that define the non-linear values of the illumination source instead of just one value of K representative of linear illumination.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">With this approach, the lookup table will hold a plurality of values that can be derived from calibration of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Applicant's technique, as described so far, can be used to measure height of a single point on an object under examination. To build a complete surface profile of an object or surface under examination, the object under examination (or the complete height measurement device) may be moved to many different locations so that a large number of points on the surface of the object are examined. However, this approach is too slow for many applications to be practical. In the following section, Applicant's proposed method is expanded so that a line profile of a surface under examination may be immediately obtained. By taking a number of these line profiles, a complete 3D map of the surface under examination may be developed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to obtain a line profile of a section, rather than height value for a single point, it is proposed that a two-dimensional imaging sensor be used. Such a sensor and associated system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Here, light source <b>30</b> is used to develop intensity pattern <b>10</b> having a gradient as described above, such as a film negative <b>11</b> containing the gradient, an image of which being developed telecentrically (or collimated) by projector lens <b>32</b> onto surface under examination <b>34</b>. The projection mechanism may incorporate a Shiempflug principle that dictates an angle of the axis of lens <b>32</b> with respect to a plane of film <b>11</b> so that the image of the gradient is uniformly focused. Alternately, a non-telecentric intensity pattern and imaging may be used. However, this would require further processing of image data to avoid measurement errors. Imaging lens <b>36</b> telecentrically forms an image of surface under examination <b>34</b> onto imager <b>38</b>, which records reflected intensity values of line section <b>40</b>, line section <b>42</b> and line section <b>44</b> at position R<sub>0</sub>, R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2</sub>. Images of line section <b>40</b>, line section <b>42</b> and line section <b>44</b> formed on imager <b>38</b> are image row <b>46</b>, image row <b>48</b> and image row <b>50</b>, respectively. Where objects to be measured are small in height, then rows <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> may be closer together, and where objects to be measured are taller, then pixel rows <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> are further apart. Thus, a range of height measurement is dependent on row spacing.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">During the scanning operation, imager <b>38</b> is triggered at known position intervals, using some form of position sensing device, to capture an image and output intensity values for all pixels along rows that correspond to locations designated by image row <b>46</b>, image row <b>48</b> and image row <b>50</b>. Hence, at each interval, intensity values of 3 rows of surface under examination <b>34</b> are recorded. These intensity values correspond to M<sub>0</sub>, M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>values as described above, but instead of just one value, there are an array of values for each recorded row of pixels along selected rows of image captured. Once intensity values M<sub>0</sub>, M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>for the same line section within scene under examination <b>34</b> are recorded, Equations [1] and [2] can be used to compute height for each pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If a conventional 2D imager, such as those used in surveillance or general-purpose machine vision cameras, are used, scanning rate would be extremely slow as an image acquisition frame rate of a conventional image sensor is usually around 30 frames per second. By partial scanning, this can be increased but not to an extent that would allow high-speed scanning. An alternative to a two dimensional imager would be to use a tri-linear, line-scan sensor. An example of this approach is documented in [12]. This type of sensor has only three rows of pixels used to capture data. However, this would not allow combined 2D imaging, or static 2D imaging without any scanning. Moreover, a tri-linear sensor has a fixed spacing between three rows of sensing elements. This would imply that locations of line section <b>40</b>, line section <b>42</b> and line section <b>44</b> is dictated by magnification of imaging lens <b>36</b>, meaning that optimization of performance of the system would not be possible. To overcome these problems, a high-speed 2D, CMOS imager such as MT9M413 from Micron Technology&#x2122;, Inc. located in Pasadena, Calif. may be used. This type of sensor offers two distinct features, a first of which is random access pixel read capability resulting in very short read-out times as readout of pixels may be limited to just a few rows, as opposed to an entire frame. A second advantage is that a data rate of this sensor is about 660 MHz, which is extremely fast. When this feature is combined with the random access capability as described, image acquisition rates as high as 500,000 rows (lines) per second may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With Applicant's system, the MT9M413 sensor (or a similar sensor) may be used to obtain intensity values from 3 randomly positioned rows of pixels at a rate of over 9400 rows per second (allowing 100 microsecond for exposure). This high acquisition rate allows a scanning operation to be carried out much faster than methods of the prior art. Furthermore, the selected sensor has on-board A/D converters, and outputs pixel intensities in digital format. This sensor is therefore ideal for pre-processing intensity values to compute height data and only transmit height information to be recorded. This ensures that data bandwidth between the 3D measurement system and other processing units, such as a computer that may be used to further analyze data, may be simplified to minimize cost.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One main benefit of Applicant's approach is that use of a high-speed, random access, 2D imager such as the MT9M413 manufactured by Micron Technology&#x2122; as described above, allows imaging system <b>22</b> to be controlled, for example by a computer, so that the imaging system may be commanded to output full 2D images when required, and output 3D height information when a scanning operation takes place. For example, where printed circuit board assemblies are being inspected, it is required that 2D images are taken first to compute a precise location of the assembly or part being inspected, and then scan areas of interest to perform three-dimensional imaging and inspection. This flexibility of being able to switch from 2D to 3D at will is extremely useful as it allows the same system to be used for both 2D and 3D applications. Furthermore, Applicant's method allows 2D and 3D images to be acquired during a scanning operation. Since the imager of Applicant's invention facilitates random access readout of any part of the sensor, it is therefore a simple programming and control issue to read three rows of images needed for computation of height values while simultaneously reading read ing a 4 row (or number of rows) illuminated differently to produce 2D images. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a separate light source <b>60</b> projects light onto an area <b>61</b> that falls under R<b>3</b>. Imaging system <b>62</b> can be commanded to capture an image of a surface section corresponding to R<b>3</b> simultaneously with acquisition of images related R<sub>0</sub>, R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2</sub>. To ensure that irradiation produced by light source <b>60</b> does not interfere with projected intensity pattern <b>64</b>, one can use different wavelengths of light for light sources <b>64</b> and <b>60</b> in combination with light filtering techniques, mechanical shutters, or any other suitable means. Of course, intensity that is read at location R<sub>2</sub>, or simply a value of r (average of M<sub>0 </sub>and M<sub>2</sub>) may be used to produce a 2D image. However, having flexibility to optimize capture of both 2D and 3D images is an important factor for most industrial applications, while additional complexity related to reading one more row of pixels is negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As mentioned earlier, capturing images of real-world applications is always a challenge because it is difficult, and at times impossible, to find an imaging illumination that is optimum (or even barely works) for all types of objects to be imaged. Industrial components, such as printed circuit boards, contain many different objects of different color, texture and reflectivity. Applicant's approach offers potential to optimize imaging condition for both 2D and 3D imaging without need for multiple scans. This is achieved through projection of multiple intensity patterns of different contrast, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and selecting data that provides best results. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, projected intensity patterns <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>8</b> are modified so that contrast of each projected level of intensity is increased by the equivalent of one F-stop. Significantly, each pattern <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>8</b> develops a gradient <b>14</b><i>a </i><b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>14</b><i>c</i>, and <b>14</b><i>d</i>, respectively. As such, contrast of each intensity pattern is twice that of a preceding intensity pattern with a gradient disposed between each pattern. A lowest light level between each pattern represents a darkest reference intensity level.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, regions designated P<b>1</b> corresponds to a first, lowest intensity pattern <b>70</b>. This pattern is arbitrarily assigned a contrast value of 1. The second pattern or region P<b>2</b> is assigned a contrast value of 2, which is twice that of P<b>1</b>. This process of doubling a contrast value for each pattern is extended to regions P<b>3</b> and P<b>4</b>. Note that while only 4 regions are shown to simplify presentation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, any practical number of regions may be selected depending on the application, with more regions allowing a wider range of reflectivities to be measured. Also, an increase in contrast from one region to another may be in increments other than doubling. When a composite pattern such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, instead of a gradient is used, an imaging arrangement as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may be used. As can be seen, for each region P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b>, P<b>4</b>, there are three corresponding rows of images. For a first region P<b>1</b> of the pattern, imaging rows that correspond to R<sub>0</sub>, R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>are captured. Similarly, for a second region P<sub>2</sub>, imaging rows that correspond to R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>, and R<sub>5 </sub>are captured. For section P<b>3</b>, image rows corresponding to R<sub>6</sub>, R<sub>7 </sub>and R<sub>8 </sub>are captured, and for region P<b>4</b>, image rows corresponding to R<sub>9</sub>, R<sub>10 </sub>and R<sub>11 </sub>are captured. As scanning takes place, intensity values of pixels that correspond to all rows corresponding to locations R<sub>0 </sub>thru R<sub>11 </sub>are read and analyzed to select an optimum row. Here, the goal is to select data from a set of rows that is neither under-exposed nor over-exposed, but yet has a highest contrast. One possible algorithm for determining which set of rows to obtain data from involves calculating a score for each set of rows as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Score=Min [(<i>I</i><sub>1</sub><i>&#x2212;I</i><sub>0</sub>),(<i>I</i><sub>2</sub><i>&#x2212;I</i><sub>1</sub>)]&#x2003;&#x2003;[3]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The data from rows that have a highest score value is selected. This operation is performed for all pixels of all rows within each of regions P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b> and P<b>4</b>, thereby resulting in optimum data analysis for each individual pixel. Furthermore, a user can associate a threshold with a score value to flag those measurements, if any, that may not have sufficient imaging contrast to result in reliable height information.
</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The concept of projecting an intensity pattern with multiple sections may be further extended to develop a measurement system having multiple measuring parameters, such as varying range and resolution. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an intensity pattern that has 4 intensity regions, each with a different and increasing wavelengths or gradients W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b>, W<b>3</b> and W<b>4</b>. A measuring range with respect to height for each gradient region is proportional to its wavelength. In other words, the wider the gradient, such as W<b>4</b>, the taller a measured object may be, although accuracy is somewhat reduced. Conversely, a narrower gradient, such as W<b>1</b>, the smaller an object must be but measurement accuracy is enhanced. Hence, the system may have 4 different measurement ranges. Obviously, the number of intensity regions W may be reduced or increased to meet different requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, it is to be noted that all above-mentioned concepts, i.e. combined 3D and 2D imaging, extending dynamic range by use of multiple intensity regions and extending a measuring range by projecting multiple intensity regions may be combined together to produce a unique measuring system that offers all the above advantages in one system. Of course, these additions affect throughput of the system because more rows of the imaging sensor are required to be read. However, since the sensor of the instant invention has an extremely high bandwidth, processing time required to process a few more lines is relatively negligible. For this sensor, a measurement rate in terms of cross-sectional profile samples is given by the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Rate of profile samples=1/(Exposure period+(<i>N*L</i>))&#x2003;&#x2003;[4]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Where N is the number of rows of the sensor selected for reading and L is the readout time for each row. For the MT9M413 sensor L is equal to 1.94 (approximately) microseconds. Hence:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Rate of profile samples=1/(Exposure period+(<i>N*</i>1.94))&#x2003;&#x2003;[5]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
For example, assuming an exposure period of 100 microseconds and that the measurement system requires a total of 13 rows to be read, one for generating a 2D scanned image and 12 rows for the four intensity sections (as was shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), the rate will be:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Rate of profile samples=1/(0.0001+(13*0.00000194))=7985(profiles/second)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Considering that the sensor of the instant invention has 1280 pixels along each row, an actual number of 3D measurement samples will be in excess of (7985*1280), or 12.22 million samples per second, which is extremely fast for this type of system.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a zoom lens suitable for use in small equipment having an image pickup capability, such as PDAs (personal digital assistants), video cameras, and digital still cameras (commonly referred to as digital cameras), and similar devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Image pickup elements, such as CCDs (Charge Coupled Devices) and CMOSs (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors), have been used in digital still cameras and similar imaging devices with image pickup elements that are extremely miniaturized. This miniaturization, along with the light weight that this miniaturization supports, has been accompanied by a demand that the main body of the image pickup devices and the lenses mounted in these devices and used for imaging be similarly miniaturized and made light weight.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, image pickup elements having a large number of pixels have been developed in order to achieve high image quality, and lens systems that provide even higher resolution and higher contrast performance also have been required. Moreover, there is now a requirement for an optical zoom mode capable of zooming without deterioration of the image and the development of a compact image pickup device mounted with a zoom lens has been desired.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an image pickup device using a mounted zoom lens for imaging, the thickness of the image pickup device is largely dependent upon the size of the lens system. Particularly, in a construction in which optical elements forming the lens system are arrayed linearly in one direction without changing the direction of the optical axis, the size of the image pickup device in the thickness direction is actually determined by the length from the optical element on the object side of the lens system to an image pickup element. On the other hand, the larger the number of lens elements in the lens system, the more easily the recent requirements for a larger number of pixels and higher performance of the image pickup element may be satisfied, making it difficult to shorten the overall length of the lens system, and, in turn, making it difficult to make the entire image pickup device thinner. Accordingly, a zoom lens has been proposed that adopts a so-called reflective optical system in which the optical path of the lens system is folded in order to make the image pickup device thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, the zoom lens described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 2000-131610 is constructed with a first lens group having positive refractive power, a second lens group having negative refractive power, a third lens group having positive refractive power and a fourth lens group having positive refractive power, and, additionally, includes a prism having a reflective surface for folding the optical path at least approximately ninety degrees in the first lens group. This zoom lens performs zooming by moving the second lens group and the fourth lens group.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the zoom lens described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 2000-131610 is mounted in an image pickup device, its thickness as an image pickup device greatly depends on the size of the portion of the first lens group, that is used for folding the optical path, rather than the overall length of the zoom lens along the optical axis. Therefore, in order to make the image pickup device thinner, it is preferable to miniaturize the first lens group. In the zoom lens of Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 2000-131610, the lens element on the object side of the zoom lens is especially large and there is room for improvement in terms of miniaturization. Additionally, the development of a zoom lens that relaxes requirements for minimizing the diameter of the lens element on the object side in achieving miniaturization and that is suitable for mounting in an image pickup device in order to make it thinner, has been desired.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A general description of the zoom lens of the present invention that pertains to two embodiments of the invention, described in more detail below, will first be given with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that shows Embodiment 1. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, lens elements are referenced by the letter G followed by a number denoting their order from the object side of the zoom lens along the optical axis Z<b>1</b>, from G<b>1</b> to G<b>11</b>. Similarly, radii of curvature of the surfaces of the various optical elements, including the lens surfaces, are referenced by the letter R followed by a number denoting their order from the object side of the zoom lens, from R<b>1</b> to R<b>23</b>. The on-axis surface spacings along the optical axis Z<b>1</b> of the various optical surfaces are referenced by the letter D followed by a number denoting their order from the object side of the zoom lens, but only the spacings that vary with zooming are labeled on the figures. In a similar manner, the four lens groups are labeled <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b> in order from the object side of the zoom lens and the lens components belonging to each lens group are indicated by the brackets adjacent the labels <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;lens group&#x201d; is defined in terms of &#x201c;lens elements&#x201d; and &#x201c;lens components&#x201d; as explained herein. The term &#x201c;lens element&#x201d; is herein defined as a single transparent mass of refractive material having two opposed refracting surfaces, which surfaces are positioned at least generally transversely of the optical axis of the zoom lens. The term &#x201c;lens component&#x201d; is herein defined as (a) a single lens element spaced so far from any adjacent lens element that the spacing cannot be neglected in computing the optical image forming properties of the lens elements or (b) two or more lens elements that have their adjacent lens surfaces either in full overall contact or overall so close together that the spacings between adjacent lens surfaces of the different lens elements are so small that the spacings can be neglected in computing the optical image forming properties of the two or more lens elements. Thus, some lens elements may also be lens components. Therefore, the terms &#x201c;lens element&#x201d; and &#x201c;lens component&#x201d; should not be taken as mutually exclusive terms. In fact, the terms may frequently be used to describe a single lens element in accordance with part (a) above of the definition of a &#x201c;lens component.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;lens group&#x201d; is herein defined as an assembly of one or more lens components in optical series and with no intervening lens components along an optical axis that during zooming is movable as a single unit relative to another lens component or other lens components.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a straight line to the left of lens group <b>20</b> and a curved line to the left of lens group <b>40</b> have their ends labeled with a W to indicate these lens groups positions along the optical axis at the wide-angle end and with a T to indicate these lens groups positions along the optical axis at the telephoto end. In accordance with the vertical component of these line segments as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, lens group <b>20</b> and lens group <b>40</b> move along the optical axis Z<b>1</b> during zooming in order to vary the surface spacings D<b>8</b>, D<b>13</b>, D<b>16</b>, and D<b>21</b>. Embodiment 2, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, operates in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The zoom lens of the present invention is suitable for being mounted and used in small equipment having an image pickup capability, such as PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), video cameras, digital still cameras, and similar imaging devices and includes, in order from the object side along the optical axis Z<b>1</b>, a first lens group <b>10</b> of positive refractive power and having a reflecting member with a reflecting surface for folding the optical axis at least approximately ninety degrees, a second lens group <b>20</b> having negative refractive power, a third lens group <b>30</b> having positive refractive power and having a stop St on its image side, and a fourth lens group <b>40</b> having positive refractive power. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a right-angle prism G<b>2</b> in the first lens group <b>10</b> serves as the reflecting member having a reflecting surface for folding the optical axis at least approximately ninety degrees. By providing the reflecting surface within the first lens group <b>10</b> having refractive elements and properly constructing the various lens groups, a thin construction can be made.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An image pickup element (not shown in the drawings) is arranged at the image plane of the zoom lens. Various optical elements are represented by a structure labeled GC in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that is arranged between the fourth lens group <b>40</b> and the image pickup plane in accordance with the construction with this location being at the image end of the zoom lens where the main body of the image pickup device, such as a camera, is located. Exemplary optical elements for the structure labeled GC in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> include a glass cover for protection of the image pickup element and various optical filters.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the zoom lens of the present invention, the second lens group <b>20</b> and the fourth lens group <b>40</b> move along the optical axis during zooming and the fourth lens group <b>40</b> moves along the optical axis during focusing. The second lens group <b>20</b> mainly provides a variator function of changing the focal length and the fourth lens group <b>40</b> mainly provides a compensating function of correcting for image plane fluctuation associated with the changing of the focal length. The second lens group <b>20</b> and the fourth lens group <b>40</b> move along the optical axis as indicated by the locus of points shown by solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The first lens group <b>10</b> and the third lens group <b>30</b> are stationary during zooming and focusing.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The zoom lens of the present invention satisfies the following Conditions (1) and (2):

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4A</figref>, the spherical aberration (in mm) is shown for the wavelengths 587.6 nm (the d-line), 435.8 nm (the g-line), and 656.3 nm (the C-line), and the f-number (FNO.) is shown. In the remaining figures, &#x3c9; is the half-field angle. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 4B</figref>, the astigmatism (in mm) is shown for both the sagittal image surface S (solid line) and the tangential image surface T (broken line) and is measured at 587.6 nm (the d-line). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 4C</figref>, distortion (in percent) is measured at 587.6 nm (the d-line).

<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the zoom lens of Embodiment 2 at the wide-angle end. Embodiment 2 is similar to Embodiment 1 and therefore only the differences between Embodiment 2 and Embodiment 1 will be explained. Embodiment 2 differs from Embodiment 1 in its lens element configuration by having different radii of curvature of the lens surfaces, different aspheric coefficients of the aspheric lens surfaces, different optical element surface spacings, and some different refractive indexes and Abbe numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Table 5 below lists the group number (or GC, as appropriate), the surface number # in order from the object side, the radius of curvature R (in mm) of each surface on the optical axis, the on-axis surface spacing D (in mm) except that the on-axis surface spacings that vary with zooming are listed in Table 7 below, as well as the refractive index N<sub>d </sub>and the Abbe number v<sub>d </sub>at the d-line (587.6 nm) of each optical element for Embodiment 2. Note that although R is the on-axis radius of curvature, for convenience of illustration, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the lead lines from the R reference symbols extend to the surfaces being referenced but do not extend to the on-axis positions. Listed in the bottom portion of Table 5 are the focal length f (in mm) and the f-number F<sub>NO </sub>at the wide-angle and telephoto ends, and the maximum field angle 2&#x3c9; at the wide-angle end and at the telephoto end for Embodiment 2.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One area of optical fiber management is the routing of optical fibers from one piece of equipment to another. For example, in a telecommunications facility, optical fiber cables are routed between fiber distribution equipment and optical line terminating equipment. In buildings and other structures that carry such equipment, the cable routing typically takes place in concealed ceiling areas or in other manners to route cables from one location to another.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When routing optical fibers and other cables such as copper wires, it is desirable that a routing system is readily modifiable and adaptable to changes in equipment needs. Accordingly, such routing systems include a plurality of components. For example, longitudinal trough members can be used to carry optical fibers along straight passages. Fittings can be used at intervals to accomplish bends, turns, and changes in elevation. Trumpets can be used to allow cable to enter and exit trough members at proper bend radii. The trough members, fittings, and trumpets are joined together by couplings to form the cable routing system. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,067,678; 5,316,243; 5,752,781; 6,709,186; and 6,715,719 teach cable routing systems that include a plurality of trough members, fittings, trumpets that are joined by couplers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various concerns arise with the use of such systems. One concern is that a plurality of components is used for joining the trough members, fittings, and trumpets. These components increase the number of pieces in the system and can increase the costs associated with and size of the final system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;couple&#x201d; and &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; mean to join or attach a first element in relation to a second element, whether the attachment is made directly with the second element or indirectly through one or more intermediate components.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example cable trough system <b>100</b> (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;raceway&#x201d;). Trough system <b>100</b> generally includes a horizontal trough portion <b>110</b> and a vertical trough portion <b>150</b>. In example embodiments, horizontal trough portion <b>110</b> is positioned adjacent to or within a ceiling of a structure, and vertical trough portion <b>150</b> is coupled to and extends downwardly from horizontal trough portion <b>110</b>, as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Horizontal trough portion <b>110</b> includes a plurality of longitudinal trough members <b>112</b> (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;straight sections&#x201d;) that are coupled to respective fittings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> by couplers <b>122</b> (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;junctions&#x201d;). In example embodiments, couplers <b>122</b> are configured as one or more of the couplers disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,067,678; 5,316,243; 5,752,781; 6,709,186; and 6,715,719, the entireties of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Generally, each coupler <b>122</b> includes one or more locking elements that couple one trough member <b>112</b> to another trough member <b>112</b> or to fittings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>. Horizontal trough portion <b>110</b> is configured to allow cables to be routed therethrough from and to vertical trough portion <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In example embodiments, horizontal trough portion <b>110</b> is coupled to vertical trough portion <b>150</b> by fittings <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, as described further below. Vertical trough portion <b>150</b> includes a plurality of longitudinal trough members <b>152</b> coupled to each other by fittings <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>166</b>. A plurality of slotted trough members <b>170</b> are coupled to adjacent trough members <b>152</b> by trumpet members <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As used herein, the term &#x201c;fitting&#x201d; means a component of a trough system that is curved in a longitudinal direction to allow for changes in elevation (e.g., dips) and/or changes in direction (e.g., bends and turns). Examples of such fittings include, without limitation: up and down elbows (e.g., 45 and 90 degrees); elbows (e.g., 45 and 90 degrees); tees; and crosses. In example embodiments, fittings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>166</b> present a cross-section similar to that of trough members <b>112</b>, <b>152</b>, respectively, such that each of the fittings defines a cable pathway which, when connected to the trough members, provides for a continuous cable pathway which includes bends, dips and turns.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Horizontal and vertical trough portions <b>110</b>, <b>150</b> of trough system <b>100</b> form an integrated raceway system through which cable is routed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A plurality of openings <b>190</b> are formed between adjacent trough members <b>152</b>, <b>170</b>. In example embodiments, vertical trough portion <b>150</b> is mounted to a rack <b>192</b> and includes a plurality of cable routing devices. Fiber optic equipment (not shown), such as fiber distribution equipment and optical line terminating equipment, is also mounted to rack <b>192</b> such that the fiber optic equipment is accessible through openings <b>190</b>. Cable is routed to and from the fiber optic equipment through vertical trough portion <b>150</b> and horizontal trough portion <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, example fitting <b>162</b> is shown. Fitting <b>162</b> includes a bottom wall <b>210</b> and side walls <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> that generally form a U-shaped trough. Bottom and side walls <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> of fitting <b>162</b> are curved in a longitudinal direction to form a 90 degree bend or elbow through which cable is routed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each end of fitting <b>162</b> includes a coupling portion <b>220</b>. In example embodiments, each coupling portion <b>220</b> is formed as an integrated part of fitting <b>162</b> such that fitting <b>162</b> including and coupling portions <b>220</b> are of a one-piece construction.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Coupling portion <b>220</b> includes bottom and side walls <b>227</b>, <b>223</b> that form a first U-shaped guiding surface <b>222</b>, and bottom and side walls <b>225</b>, <b>221</b> that form a second U-shaped guiding surface <b>224</b>. A spacing <b>226</b> is formed between first and second guiding surfaces <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>. As described further below, spacing <b>226</b> is sized to receive an end of a trough member, such as trough members <b>152</b>. In example embodiments, spacing <b>226</b> is sized to receive trough members of 2 inches, 4 inches, 6 inches, or 12 inches in size. Other sizes can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, in example embodiments, one or more spring members <b>230</b> are positioned within spacing <b>226</b>. For example, in one embodiment, two spring members <b>230</b> are positioned on opposite sides between side walls <b>221</b>, <b>223</b>, and another spring member <b>230</b> is positioned between bottom walls <b>225</b>, <b>227</b>. In other configurations, more or fewer spring members <b>230</b> can be used. For example, in an alternative embodiment, four spring members <b>230</b> are included between first and second guiding surfaces <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the example shown, each spring member <b>230</b> is a leaf spring including a base <b>261</b> and a main body <b>262</b>. In example embodiments, base <b>261</b> includes an aperture <b>267</b> formed therein to engage a projection <b>369</b> formed within spacing <b>226</b> to retain spring member <b>230</b> within spacing <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Main body <b>262</b> of spring member <b>230</b> is bowed such that main body <b>262</b> extends towards second guiding surface <b>224</b>. Spring member <b>230</b> has a terminal end <b>265</b> that is bent back to permit a leading end of trough members <b>152</b> to be inserted within spacing <b>226</b>. Upon sliding of the leading end of a trough member <b>152</b> into spacing <b>226</b>, the leading end of trough member <b>152</b> forces main body <b>262</b> of spring member <b>230</b> away from first guiding surface <b>222</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In example embodiments, each spring member <b>230</b> is metallic and includes cutout tabs <b>266</b> that project toward second guiding surface <b>224</b> and are angled into the direction of spacing <b>226</b>. Tabs <b>266</b> act as knife edges, which cut into the plastic of trough members <b>152</b> to bite into the walls trough members <b>152</b> and resist the withdrawal of the walls of the trough members <b>152</b> out of spacing <b>226</b> of fitting <b>162</b>. As a result, the clamping force not only includes the spring bias to hold trough members <b>152</b> within fitting <b>162</b>, but also includes the knife action of tabs <b>266</b> biting into the material of trough members <b>152</b> to retain the trough members within fitting <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, fitting <b>162</b> also includes a plurality of fingers <b>280</b> coupled to opposing portions <b>296</b> formed by fitting <b>162</b>. In example embodiments, each finger <b>280</b> includes a curved main body <b>284</b> with a free end <b>286</b> and an attachment end <b>288</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Leg members <b>292</b>, <b>294</b> with barbs <b>295</b> are coupled to attachment end <b>288</b> to allow finger <b>280</b> to be positioned within an aperture <b>297</b> formed by portion <b>296</b> of fitting <b>162</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>. Leg members <b>292</b>, <b>294</b> extend through aperture <b>297</b> and barbs <b>295</b> engage a lower surface of portion <b>296</b> to couple finger <b>280</b> to fitting <b>162</b>. Finger <b>280</b> can be removed from portion <b>296</b> by pushing leg members <b>292</b>, <b>294</b> towards one another until barbs <b>295</b> clear portion <b>296</b>, thereby allowing leg members <b>292</b>, <b>294</b> to be removed from aperture <b>297</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, opposing fingers <b>280</b> are coupled to each end of fitting <b>162</b>. Fingers <b>280</b> retain cables within fitting <b>162</b>. In the example shown, opposing fingers <b>280</b> are identical in structure, but curve in opposite directions when mounted to fitting <b>162</b> because each finger <b>280</b> is mounted on an opposing portion <b>296</b> of fitting <b>162</b>. In example embodiments, each opposing portion <b>296</b> is located directly across from the other opposing portion <b>296</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Main body <b>284</b> of fingers <b>280</b> can vary in length depending on the size (e.g., width) of fitting <b>162</b>. In example embodiments, main body <b>284</b> is long enough so that opposite fingers <b>280</b> overlap to form space <b>284</b>. Other configurations are possible. Since fingers <b>280</b> curve in opposite directions, a space <b>284</b> is formed between free ends <b>286</b> of fingers <b>280</b>. The overlap of opposite fingers <b>280</b> and relatively small size of space <b>284</b> function to keep cable within fitting <b>162</b>, while allowing cable to be added and removed without removing fingers <b>280</b> from fitting <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, example fitting <b>164</b> is shown. Fitting <b>164</b> includes a bottom wall <b>310</b> and side walls <b>312</b>, <b>313</b>, <b>314</b> that generally form a U-shaped trough. Bottom and side walls <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>313</b>, <b>314</b> of fitting <b>164</b> form a tee through which cable is routed. Each end of fitting <b>164</b> includes coupling portion <b>220</b> with spring members <b>230</b> positioned therein to couple fitting <b>164</b> to trough members <b>152</b> in a similar manner to that described above with respect to fitting <b>162</b>. For example, fitting <b>164</b> can be coupled to three trough members. A plurality of fingers <b>280</b> are coupled to portions <b>296</b> of fitting <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, example fitting <b>166</b> is shown. Fitting <b>166</b> includes a bottom wall <b>410</b> and side walls <b>412</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>415</b> that generally form a U-shaped trough. Bottom and side walls <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>415</b> of fitting <b>166</b> form a cross through which cable can be routed. Each end of fitting <b>166</b> includes coupling portion <b>220</b> with spring members <b>230</b> positioned therein to couple fitting <b>166</b> to trough members <b>152</b> in a similar manner to that described above with respect to fitting <b>162</b>. For example, fitting <b>166</b> can be coupled to four trough members. A plurality of fingers <b>280</b> are coupled to portions <b>296</b> of fitting <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9&#x2013;13</figref>, example trumpet member <b>172</b> is shown. Trumpet member <b>172</b> includes a bottom wall <b>510</b> and side walls <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> that generally form the shape of a flared trumpet. A coupling portion <b>520</b> of trumpet member <b>172</b> includes first and second surfaces <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> that form a space <b>526</b> therebetween. Spring members <b>230</b> are positioned therein to couple trumpet member <b>172</b> to trough members <b>152</b> by inserting coupling portion <b>520</b> of trumpet member <b>172</b> into an aperture <b>155</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 18</figref>) formed in one of side walls <b>605</b>, <b>606</b> of trough member <b>152</b>. A plurality of fingers <b>280</b> are coupled to portions <b>596</b> of trumpet member <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A second coupling portion <b>550</b> of trumpet member <b>172</b> includes first and second surfaces <b>552</b>, <b>554</b> that form a space <b>556</b> therebetween. Spring members <b>230</b> are positioned therein to couple trumpet member <b>172</b> to a slotted trough member <b>170</b> in a similar manner to that described above with respect to fitting <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, trough member <b>152</b> is shown. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;trough member&#x201d; is used to refer to any trough, railway, raceway, or similarly configured component including any number of ends. Although a specific embodiment of a trough member is shown in and described herein, other trough members can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Trough member <b>152</b> includes a first terminal end <b>602</b> and a second terminal end <b>603</b>. Trough member <b>152</b> is generally in the shape of a U-shaped trough including first and second side walls <b>605</b>, <b>606</b> coupled by a bottom wall <b>607</b>, thereby defining an interior surface <b>608</b> and an exterior surface <b>609</b>. Walls <b>605</b>, <b>606</b>, <b>607</b> are each generally planar to form a straight section through which cable is run.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In example embodiments, one or more apertures <b>155</b> can be formed in side walls <b>605</b>, <b>606</b> to receive, for example, trumpet members <b>172</b>. In addition, apertures <b>651</b> are formed in bottom wall <b>607</b>. Fasteners (not shown) can be extended through apertures <b>651</b> to couple trough member <b>152</b> to rack <b>192</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Example exit flares <b>720</b> can be positioned within slots <b>710</b> to provide edge protection for cable entering and exiting slotted trough member <b>170</b> through slots <b>710</b>. Exit flares <b>720</b> include a bottom wall <b>732</b> and side walls <b>734</b>, <b>736</b> that generally form a flared trough configuration. First and second projections <b>738</b>, <b>740</b> form a groove <b>742</b> therebetween. Adjacent walls portions <b>712</b> of slotted trough member <b>170</b> between slots <b>710</b> in sidewalls <b>705</b>, <b>706</b> are received in groove <b>742</b> to couple exit flare <b>720</b> to slotted trough member <b>170</b>. In example embodiments, portions <b>712</b> are flexible so that adjacent portions <b>712</b> can be bowed slightly away from one another to allow exit flare <b>720</b> to be positioned within slot <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an example method for coupling trough members <b>152</b> to fittings <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>166</b> is as follows. Terminal end <b>602</b> of trough member <b>152</b> is inserted into spacing <b>226</b> of coupling portion <b>220</b> of fitting <b>162</b>, thereby causing interior surface <b>608</b> of trough member <b>152</b> to slide along spring members <b>230</b> positioned therein. In alternative embodiments, spring members <b>230</b> can be positioned in spacing <b>226</b> to engage other portions of trough member <b>152</b>, such as exterior surface <b>609</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With trough member <b>152</b> fully inserted into coupling portion <b>220</b> of fitting <b>162</b>, tabs <b>266</b> of spring members <b>230</b> engage interior surface <b>308</b> of trough member <b>152</b> to resist movement of trough member <b>152</b> out of coupling portion <b>220</b>. Additional trough members <b>152</b> can be coupled to the other coupling portion <b>220</b> of fitting <b>162</b> in a similar manner. Fittings <b>164</b>, <b>166</b> function in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">An example method for coupling trumpet member <b>172</b> to trough member <b>152</b> and slotted trough member <b>170</b> is as follows. Initially, aperture <b>155</b> is formed at the desired location in one of side walls <b>605</b>, <b>606</b> of trough member <b>152</b> by, for example, cutting side wall <b>605</b> to form aperture <b>155</b>. Next, space <b>526</b> of coupling portion <b>520</b> of trumpet member <b>172</b> is inserted into aperture <b>155</b> so that adjacent portions of side wall <b>605</b> forming aperture <b>155</b> are received within space <b>526</b>. With trumpet member <b>172</b> fully inserted into aperture <b>155</b>, tabs <b>266</b> of spring members <b>230</b> positioned in coupling portion <b>520</b> engage side wall <b>605</b> of trough member <b>152</b> to resist movement of trumpet member <b>172</b> out of aperture <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Slotted trough member <b>170</b> can be coupled to coupling portion <b>550</b> by inserting a terminal end of slotted trough member <b>170</b> into spacing <b>556</b> of coupling portion <b>550</b> of trumpet member <b>172</b>, thereby causing slotted trough member <b>170</b> to slide along tabs <b>266</b> of spring members <b>230</b> positioned therein. With slotted trough member <b>170</b> fully inserted into coupling portion <b>520</b> of trumpet member <b>172</b>, tabs <b>266</b> of spring members <b>230</b> engage slotted trough member <b>170</b> to resist movement of trough member <b>170</b> out of coupling portion <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 15</figref>, vertical trough portion <b>150</b> of trough system <b>100</b> can be coupled to horizontal trough portion <b>110</b> as follows. One end of fitting <b>120</b> is coupled to trough member <b>112</b> by coupler <b>122</b>. The other end of fitting <b>120</b> is coupled to another coupler <b>122</b> that is, in turn, coupled to fitting <b>164</b> using coupling portion <b>220</b> of fitting <b>164</b>. Fitting <b>118</b> is coupled between horizontal and vertical trough portions <b>110</b>, <b>150</b> in a similar manner. Other configurations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With trough system <b>100</b> fully assembled, cable can be routed therethrough. Fingers can be coupled to the example fittings and trumpets described herein to help to maintain the cable within trough system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In example embodiments, the fittings and trumpet members of the vertical trough portion can be coupled to the trough members without the use of separate couplers because of the coupling portions that are integrally formed with the fittings and trumpet members. This can result in a reduction in the number of parts and complexity for the system. In addition, this can result in added space within opening <b>190</b> of rack <b>192</b> for optical equipment and the routing of cable because of the reduction in the number of couplers that can take up space.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In example embodiments, the fittings and trumpet members disclosed herein are tool-less in that the fittings and trumpet members do not require a separate tool to couple the fittings and the trumpet members to the trough members.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In example embodiments, the fittings and trumpet members disclosed herein are auto-locking in that, when the trough member is introduced into the coupling portion of the fitting or trumpet, the spring members of the coupling portion automatically couple the trough member to the fitting or trumpet.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The coupler and trough members disclosed herein are presented by way of example only, and other configurations are possible. For example, although the example trough system disclosed herein is shown with a vertical trough portion with a plurality of fittings, trumpet members, and trough members, in alternative embodiments the fittings, trumpet members, and trough members of the vertical trough portion can be used in a horizontal configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The above specification, examples and data provide a complete description of the manufacture and of the invention. Since many embodiments of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure, the invention resides in the claims hereinafter appended.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to the field of mobile communications and, more particularly, to the use of wireless networking in conjunction with mobile networks.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wireless networks are becoming increasingly prevalent with thousands of so called hotspots being deployed throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. A hotspot refers to the coverage area surrounding a wireless access point within which a device can communicate wirelessly with the access point. The access point typically includes a wireless transceiver and is connected to a packet-switched communications network such as the Internet. As such, the access point provides network connectivity to those devices capable of establishing a wireless communications link with the access point. Mobile users can roam between multiple hot spots while maintaining connectivity with a communications network. Examples of hotspots or wireless networks can include those networks built around one of the 802 wireless communications protocols such as 802.11, 802.16, 802.20, and 802.15.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such wireless networks largely function independently of mobile communications networks. These wireless networks, particularly 802.11 wireless networks, often function purely as data networks. That is, typically voice communications are not carried over such networks. In consequence, the voice capability of mobile networks has yet to be integrated with 802.xx wireless networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a method, system, and apparatus that facilitates roaming between a mobile network and a wireless network without dropping a call. More particularly, the inventive arrangements disclosed herein utilize the Session Initiation Protocol refer method to handoff a call from a wireless network to a mobile network. As such, a subscriber can initiate and conduct a Voice-Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) call through a wireless access point of a wireless network. After initiating the VOIP call, the subscriber can roam to a location outside the range of the wireless access point, but within range of a mobile network. Accordingly, the VOIP call can be maintained as the portion of the call conducted over the wireless network is transferred to the mobile network using the SIP refer method. The SIP refer method is described in Internet Request For Comment (RFC) 3515.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One aspect of the present invention can include a method of roaming between a mobile network and a wireless network within a mobile communications device. Notably, the wireless network can be an 802 compliant network, for example an 802.11, 802.16, 802.20, or 802.15 wireless network. The method can include establishing a VOIP communications link with an endpoint over which a call is conducted. At least a portion of the call can be conducted over the wireless network. The method also can include initiating a handoff of at least a portion of the call from the wireless network to the mobile network using a Session Initiation Protocol refer method and continuing the call using the mobile network for at least a portion of the call rather than the wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The step of initiating a handoff can include sending a refer message to the endpoint via the VOIP communications link, receiving, via the mobile network, a signal from a Session Initiation Protocol gateway indicating an incoming mobile call from the endpoint, and sending a signal over the mobile network indicating acceptance of the incoming mobile call. The step of initiating a handoff further can include receiving an indication from the endpoint over the VOIP communications link that the Session Initiation Protocol gateway has accepted an invite from the endpoint, establishing a mobile communications link with the Session Initiation Protocol server. The endpoint also can be linked with the Session Initiation Protocol server through a second VOIP communications link, such that the call is maintained using the mobile network, and terminating the VOIP communications link with the endpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present invention can include a method of roaming between a mobile network and a wireless network within a gateway. During an established call over a VOIP communications link, wherein at least a portion of the call is conducted over the wireless network, the method can include handing off at least a portion of the call from the wireless network to the mobile network using a Session Initiation Protocol refer method. The method also can include continuing the call using the mobile network for at least a portion of the call rather than the wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The call can be conducted between a mobile device and an endpoint. Accordingly, the step of handing off at least a portion of the call can include receiving an invite from the endpoint, sending, over the mobile network, an indication of an incoming mobile call to the mobile device, receiving, over the mobile network, an indication of acceptance of the incoming mobile call from the mobile device, sending an indication to the endpoint that that the mobile call will be accepted, and establishing a mobile communications link with the mobile device and a VOIP communications link with the endpoint. As such, the call can be maintained using the mobile network. As noted, the wireless network can be an 802 compliant network.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a system <b>100</b> for roaming between a mobile communications network (mobile network) and a wireless communications network (wireless network) in accordance with the inventive arrangements disclosed herein. As shown, the system <b>100</b> can include one or more wireless networks <b>105</b>, one or more mobile networks <b>125</b>, a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) <b>145</b>, and a packet-switched network such as the Internet <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The wireless network <b>105</b> can be a wireless network that is compliant with any of the 802 communications protocols. For example, the wireless network can be compliant with one of the 802.11, 802.16, 802.20, and/or 802.15 family of communications protocols. For example, the wireless network can be configured according to the 802.11a, b, g, or 802.15.3 wireless communications protocols. As such, the wireless network <b>105</b> can include one or more access points <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>. Access points <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> each can include a wireless transceiver for communicating with one or more mobile communication devices capable of communicating over an 802.xx compliant wireless connection, for example mobile communications device <b>160</b>. Each access point <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> further can include a wired connection to the Internet <b>155</b>. Accordingly, each access point <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> can be configured to serve as an interface between wireless or mobile communications devices communicating over an 802.xx communications protocol and packet-switched networks such as the Internet <b>155</b>. The wireless network <b>105</b> can have a coverage area <b>120</b> within which mobile communications device <b>160</b> can communicate over a wireless Voice-Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) channel or communications link.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The mobile network <b>125</b> can be any of a variety of different wireless telephony networks including, but not limited to, a conventional cellular telephony network or a Personal Communications Service (PCS) network (hereafter referred to as a &#x201c;mobile network&#x201d;). The mobile network <b>125</b> can include one or more Mobile Data Base Stations (MDBS) <b>130</b> and a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) <b>135</b>. As shown, the mobile network <b>125</b> can have a coverage area <b>140</b> within which mobile communications device <b>160</b> can wirelessly communicate with the MDBS <b>130</b> over a mobile voice channel.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The MDBS <b>130</b> can send communications to and receive communications from wireless devices such as mobile communications device <b>160</b>. For example, the MDBS <b>130</b> can include a tower (not shown) for wirelessly communicating with the mobile communications device <b>160</b>. The tower can be communicatively linked with hardware and any necessary software within the MDBS <b>130</b> for converting data streams from the towers into valid signals and routing cellular (or mobile) switched data calls to the MSC <b>135</b> and/or to another mobile destination. The MDBS <b>130</b> manages and accesses the radio interface of the mobile communications device <b>160</b> from the mobile network side. The MSC <b>135</b> includes hardware and any necessary software for connecting calls by switching the digital voice data packets from one network path to another. For example, the MSC <b>135</b> can route calls between the MDBS <b>130</b>, the PSTN <b>145</b>, and/or the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) gateway <b>165</b>. Additionally, the MSC <b>135</b> can provide information such as user registration, authentication, and location updating.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The SIP gateway <b>165</b> can be an interface between the Internet <b>155</b> and the mobile network <b>125</b>. SIP is a standard protocol for initiating interactive user sessions that involve multimedia elements such as video, voice, chat, gaming, and virtual reality. SIP works in the Application layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communications model to establish, modify, and terminate multimedia sessions or Internet telephony calls. The protocol also can be used to invite participants to unicast or multicast sessions that do not necessarily involve the initiator. Because SIP supports name mapping and redirection services, SIP allows users to initiate and receive communications and services from any location, and for networks to identify the users wherever the user may be located.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">SIP is a request-response protocol, dealing with requests from clients and responses from servers. Participants are identified by SIP Uniform Resource Locators (URL's). Requests can be sent through any transport protocol, such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). SIP determines the end system to be used for the session, the communication media and media parameters, and the called party's desire to engage in the communication. Once these parameters are assured, SIP establishes call parameters at either end of the communication, and handles call transfer and termination.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, the SIP gateway <b>165</b> can include hardware and any necessary software for establishing communications links with both the mobile network <b>125</b> and the Internet <b>155</b>. The SIP gateway <b>165</b> can receive SIP invites from communications devices such as mobile communications device <b>160</b>, telephone <b>170</b>, and/or IP telephone <b>175</b> and establish communications links with each, whether via the mobile network <b>125</b>, the Internet <b>155</b>, and/or the PSTN <b>145</b> by way of the gateway <b>150</b>. While the SIP gateway <b>165</b> can serve as an interface to the Internet <b>155</b>, the SIP gateway <b>165</b> also can be used as an interface to other packet-switched networks (not shown) such as Wide Area Networks, Local Area Networks, intranets, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The SIP gateway <b>165</b> can format convert received data from the mobile network <b>125</b> and/or the Internet <b>155</b> for transmission over a different one of the networks. In illustration, the SIP gateway <b>165</b> can receive data formatted for use over the mobile network <b>125</b> and packet-switched data for use over the Internet <b>155</b>. With regard to the Internet <b>155</b> or other packet-switched networks, the SIP gateway <b>165</b> can send and receive VOIP formatted data for conducting calls over such networks. The SIP gateway <b>165</b> can convert data from one format to another so that data can be freely exchanged between the mobile network <b>125</b> and the Internet <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The PSTN <b>145</b> can include Service Switching Points (SSP), Signal Transfer Points (STP), and one or more switching systems (not shown). The SSP's are telephone switches interconnected by Switching System No. 7 (SS7) communication links. SSP's can perform call processing on calls that originate, tandem, or terminate at each respective site. The SSP's can generate SS7 messages to transfer call-related information to other SSP's or to query a Service Control Point (not shown) for routing instructions. The STP's are switches that relay messages between network switches and databases. The STP's can route SS7 messages to the correct outgoing signaling link based on SS7 message address fields.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The gateway <b>150</b> can serve as an interface between the PSTN <b>145</b> and the Internet <b>155</b>. The gateway <b>150</b> can format packet-switched data from the Internet <b>155</b> for transmission over the PSTN <b>145</b> as circuit-switched data. Similarly, the gateway <b>150</b> can format convert circuit-switched data from the PSTN <b>145</b> to packet-switched data for transmission over the Internet <b>155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The mobile communications device <b>160</b> can be configured to communicate over the mobile network <b>125</b> as well as the wireless network <b>105</b>. The mobile communications device <b>160</b> can include transceivers for communicating over both mobile networks and wireless networks. Further, the mobile communications device <b>160</b> can be configured to measure the power of signals received from each network and vary the transmission strength of signals sent to each respective network. In addition, the mobile communications device <b>160</b> also can include a SIP user agent executing therein. The SIP user agent can encode and decode SIP formatted messages which are exchanged over the wireless network <b>105</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, the mobile communications device <b>160</b> can be implemented as a mobile phone. Still, those skilled in the art will recognize that any communications device configured as described herein can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In operation, the mobile communications device <b>160</b> can communicate with the wireless network <b>105</b> via one of the access points <b>110</b> or <b>115</b>. Accordingly, the mobile communications device <b>160</b> can establish VOIP calls via the wireless network <b>105</b> with either the telephone <b>170</b> or the IP telephone <b>175</b>. Notably, both telephone <b>170</b> and IP telephone <b>175</b> can be configured to communicate using SIP as described herein. It should be appreciated that, while not shown, the mobile communications device <b>160</b> also can establish a call with another mobile device communicatively linked with the mobile network <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The mobile communications device can leave coverage area <b>120</b> of the wireless network and roam into the coverage area <b>140</b> of the mobile network <b>125</b>. Accordingly, the mobile communications device <b>160</b> can initiate a transfer of at least a portion of the VOIP call from the wireless network to the mobile network. For example, the leg of the call conducted over the wireless network <b>105</b> can be handed off to the mobile network <b>125</b> such that the mobile communications device <b>160</b> can communicate with another endpoint or call participant, for example either telephone <b>170</b> or IP telephone <b>175</b> via the SIP gateway <b>165</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method <b>200</b> of roaming between a mobile network and a wireless network in accordance with one aspect of the present invention. The method <b>200</b> can begin in a state where a user has a mobile communications device, such as a telephone, that is configured to communicate over mobile networks and an 802.xx compliant wireless network. Further, the mobile communications device can include a SIP user agent executing therein.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The method can begin in step <b>205</b> where a VOIP call is established between the mobile communications device and an endpoint. The VOIP call can be established such that the mobile communications device is communicatively linked with the Internet through a wireless network. More specifically, the mobile communications device can establish a wireless communications link with a wireless access point disposed within the wireless network, which provides connectivity to the Internet. The endpoint can be a conventional landline telephone connected to the PSTN and the Internet via a gateway, or can be an IP telephone connected with the Internet or another packet-switched network. The endpoint can be any of a variety of different voice communications devices capable of communicating using SIP as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In step <b>210</b>, the mobile communications device can roam within range of a mobile network. In step <b>215</b>, the mobile communications device can detect the mobile network. In step <b>220</b>, the mobile communications device can compare the strength or power of detected signals from both the mobile network and the wireless network so that the call can be continued over the network having the strongest signal strength. For example, the mobile communications device can determine that the signal detected from the mobile network has more power than the signal detected from the wireless network. Accordingly, the mobile communications device can initiate a transfer of the VOIP call from the wireless network to the mobile network.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In step <b>225</b>, the mobile communications device can send a SIP refer message to the endpoint. The SIP refer message can be sent using the established communication link over which the VOIP call takes place. In step <b>230</b>, the endpoint sends the invite referred, or received, from the mobile communications device to the SIP gateway via the Internet. In step <b>235</b>, the SIP gateway can signal the mobile communications device of an incoming mobile call. The SIP gateway signals the mobile communications device via the mobile network using standard mobile and/or cellular call setup techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In step <b>240</b>, the mobile communications device signals the SIP gateway that the mobile communications device will accept the incoming mobile call. The mobile communications device can respond via the mobile network using standard mobile call setup responses. As such, a mobile voice channel is established between the mobile communications device and the SIP gateway. In step <b>245</b>, the SIP gateway signals the endpoint that it will accept the call. Accordingly, the endpoint can notify the mobile communications device via the VOIP call channel that the SIP gateway has accepted the call in step <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In step <b>255</b>, a VOIP communications link is established between the endpoint and the SIP gateway. Accordingly, the mobile communications device is connected with the endpoint via the mobile voice channel to the SIP gateway, and via the VOIP communications channel from the SIP gateway to the endpoint. Still, it should be appreciated that if the endpoint is a conventional landline type of telephone, a portion of the call also can be conducted over the PSTN via a gateway disposed between the PSTN and the Internet. In step <b>260</b>, the original VOIP communications link established in step <b>205</b> between the mobile communications device and the endpoint can be terminated. In consequence, the call has been transferred from the wireless network to the mobile network.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The method described herein has been provided for purposes of illustration only. As such, it should be appreciated that particular steps can be performed in varying order without departing from the spirit or essential attributes of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention provides a solution that allows mobile communications device users to roam freely between mobile networks and 802.xx wireless networks. The embodiments disclosed herein support both voice and data communications between mobile and wireless networks. As such, mobile users can continue to access both voice and data services whether in proximity to a mobile network or a wireless network as described herein.</p>
