<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to an edging rail for a flooring.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">DE 20 2005 004 624 U1 discloses a profiled rail system which is formed by a base profile, a swivel joint, a cover profile and a pivotable covering blade. Between the base profile and the pivotable covering profile, a flooring element can be held clamped. The profiled rail system here forms an edging rail for the flooring.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">From U.S. Pat. No. 4,913,576, a profiled rail of the generic type is known. This consists of a base rail and a cover rail, which are integrally joined together by a web. The cover rail can here be elastically deformed, so that it can be forced away from the base rail. Following the insertion of a flooring between the base rail and the cover rail, the cover rail then presses elastically against the flooring.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This profiled rail system has been proven in practice and forms the starting point for the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the invention is to provide an edging rail of the type stated in the introduction, which is characterized by a simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This object is achieved according to the invention with the following features.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An edging rail serves as an edging for a flooring, in particular a parquet, laminate or stone floor. This list should not be regarded as final, however, but merely as illustrative. The edging rail has a base member and a cover member which overlaps the flooring.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For adaptation to different flooring thicknesses, the distance between the base member and the covering member is made adjustable. In this way, a sufficiently universal applicability of the edging rail is obtained. In order to obtain as simple a structure as possible, the covering member is integrally connected to the base member. Although this appears in principle to be at variance with the required height adjustability of the cover member, it is only in this way that the simplest possible design structure of the edging rail can be obtained. The height adjustability is realized, for example, by an elastic and/or plastic deformability of the edging rail. In order to be able to brace the covering member against the base member, supported on the base member is at least one drive channel, in which at least one screw can engage. This screw here passes through at least one bore in the covering member, so that, when the screw is screwed into the drive channel, the two members are pressed one against the other.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to obtain sufficient height adjustability between the covering member and the base member in spite of the one-piece structure, it is favourable if the covering member and/or the base member has at least one predetermined bending point. This predetermined bending point is here formed by a cross-sectional taper, so that the edging rail can be easily manufactured as a one-piece component by extrusion methods. Moreover, the fitting of the edging rail to the flooring is thereby facilitated, since the predetermined bending point applies a moderate spring force to the two members, which drives these apart. This makes it easier to place the edging rail onto the flooring.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Particularly for use of the edging rail as a ramp, it is advantageous if the covering member and the base member form an acute angle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to obtain a simple production of the edging rail, it is favourable if the driving channel is held on the base member by means of an undercut tongue-and-groove profiling. This facilitates, in particular, the manufacture of the edging rail by extrusion methods.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition the force for fixing the cover member can also be generated by latching means. Both the base members and the covering member here have corresponding latching means, which are preferably formed by interlocking saw-tooth profilings. These latching means allow a compression of the edging rail. By contrast, a pulling apart of covering member and base member is not possible, or only with increased force. In this way, no fastening means are visible from the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to hold the edging rail firmly on the flooring, the base member grips the flooring on the bottom side, whilst the covering member grips it on the top side. A clamping grip is hereby obtained, which ensures a good fixing of the edging rail to the flooring. An additional connection of the edging rail to a foundation surface is here possible in principle, but is not necessary. The edging rail has a base member and a covering member which overlaps the flooring.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further advantages and features of the present invention are presented in the following detailed description with reference to the accompanying figure which contains an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the drawing serves merely for the purpose of illustrating the invention and does not restrict the scope of protection of the invention.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a three-dimensional representation of an edging rail <b>1</b> for a flooring <b>2</b>. The edging rail <b>1</b> is here preferably made of metal, in particular aluminium, or of plastic. The edging rail <b>1</b> has a base member <b>3</b> and a covering member <b>4</b>, which together form an acute angle <b>5</b>. In the region of a point <b>6</b>, at which the base member <b>3</b> and the covering member <b>4</b> converge, a predetermined bending point <b>7</b> in the form of a cross-sectional taper is provided in the covering member <b>4</b>. This predetermined bending point <b>7</b> allows a pivoting of the covering member <b>4</b> in relation to the base member <b>3</b> in spite of the one-piece structure of the edging rail <b>1</b>. Alternatively or additionally, a corresponding cross-sectional taper can also be provided in the base member <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Moulded into the base member <b>3</b> is an undercut groove <b>8</b>, in which a tongue <b>9</b> of a drive channel <b>10</b> is held. The drive channel <b>10</b> is penetrated by screws <b>11</b>, which pass through bores <b>12</b> in the covering member <b>4</b>. Through tightening of the screws <b>11</b> in the drive channel <b>10</b>, the covering member <b>4</b> and the base member <b>3</b> are pressed one against the other. Between the covering member <b>4</b> and the base member <b>3</b>, the flooring <b>2</b> is held clamped. In this way, the edging rail <b>1</b> is fixed directly to the flooring <b>2</b>. Although an additional securement of the edging rail <b>1</b> to a foundation surface, for example by gluing or screwing, is possible, it is no longer necessary. This is particularly important in those cases in which the foundation must not be damaged, which is frequently the case, in particular in exhibition centres or in sales rooms.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Alternatively, the base member <b>3</b> can also be of shortened configuration, so that the flooring <b>2</b> no longer comes to lie on the base member <b>3</b>. In this case, the edging rail <b>1</b> no longer grips the flooring <b>2</b> in a clamping grip, so that a securement of the edging rail <b>1</b> to a foundation is imperative. This variant is to be preferred, in particular, in the case of soft floorings <b>2</b> such as carpets or PVC coverings.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of an edging rail <b>1</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein the same reference symbols denote the same parts. Below, only the differences relative to the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the covering member <b>4</b> is likewise secured by a screw <b>11</b>, which engages in a driving channel <b>10</b>. In addition, latching webs <b>13</b> are held both on the base member <b>3</b> and on the covering member <b>4</b> by means of corresponding tongue-and-groove profilings <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>. These latching webs <b>13</b> have saw-tooth profilings <b>14</b>, which are of interlocking configuration. When the covering member <b>4</b> and the base member <b>3</b> are mutually pressed together, these latching webs <b>13</b> slide one over the other, whereupon the saw-tooth profilings <b>14</b> catch together. Alternatively, the latching webs <b>13</b> could also have interlocking corrugations or similar profilings. This facilitates, in particular, the removal of the edging rail. In addition, the latching webs <b>13</b> form the drive channel <b>10</b> for the screw <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this embodiment, the base member <b>3</b> is also made shorter, so that the flooring <b>2</b> comes to lie next to the base member <b>3</b>. In this case, the edging rail <b>1</b> must be glued to the foundation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a three-dimensional representation of two latching webs <b>13</b>. These latching webs <b>13</b> can replace the latching webs <b>13</b> of the embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Instead of the saw-tooth profilings <b>14</b>, they have corrugations <b>15</b>. These corrugations <b>15</b> allow a simple removal of the edging rail <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is also envisaged to mutually combine features of all the embodiments in an optional manner.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Since some exemplary embodiments of the present invention are not shown or described, it must be understood that a multiplicity of changes and modifications of this exemplary embodiment described are possible, without departing from the essential idea and scope of protection of the invention defined by the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims a priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-064071 filed on Mar. 13, 2007, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a card gaming machine and a card game playing method, in which winning or losing is judged by comparing player's hand and dealer's hand composed of a predetermined number of cards and a prize is awarded depending on the winning/losing judgment result. In particular, the present invention relates to a card gaming machine and a card game playing method capable of awarding a different prize independent of the winning/losing result in the case where a side bet of a gaming value is made.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, casinos or game arcades provide card game machines or tables for card games. Card games such as Pai Gow Poker, Draw Poker or Blackjack are well known forms of card games played by using those card game machines or tables. For these card games, cards each of which has a number and a suit (e.g., Ace of Hearts) are used. And a value of a prize to be awarded to a player is determined based on a hand of cards dealt to each player (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;player's hand&#x201d;) and a hand of cards dealt to a dealer (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;dealer's hand&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As one of examples of inventions related to such card game machines or tables, there is one invention disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,793,220. In Pai Gow Poker, seven cards are dealt to a dealer and a player (one through six players), respectively. Then the dealer and each player divide the seven cards into two hands: a five-card hand (high hand) and a two-card hand (low hand). Finally, the numbers and suits in sets of the players' and those of the dealer's hands are compared to determine winning/losing and/or values of awards.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In conventional card gaming machines and card game playing methods, when a player wins the dealer, a payout is determined unambiguously according to the hand of cards the player holds (e.g., straight flush, full house, etc).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, once cards have been dealt out and at a player's own hand, the player can predict, to a certain degree, possible prizes in a game. That is, if a hand of cards a player holds is not good, the player's expectation in high prize will be very slim. In this case, the player might lose interest in the game as well.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the card gaming machine and a card game playing method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,793,220, in case a predetermined side bet has been made, the card game is played using player's hands on standard Pai Gow Poker. In detail, when a predetermined number of cards, the number of which to be dealt depends on a manner of a side bet, are dealt out, presence of a winning combination with the predetermined number of cards for the side bet is judged. And a player gets an extra prize (i.e. bonus) for the winning combination on the side bet, irrespective of winning/losing in the Pai Gow Poker. For example, in case a side bet is made for a three-card low hand, presence of winning combination of the three-card low hand is judged when cards for the three-card low hand are dealt out to all of the players. According to the conventional card game playing method, a prize depending on kind of put hand (e.g., same suit flush) is awarded to a winning player irrespective of winning/losing in Pai Gow poker.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the card gaming machine and the card game playing method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,793,220 is not free from the conventional card game problem discussed earlier. That is, players can predict, to a certain degree, their possible prizes in a game as soon as cards are dealt out. And if a player does not hold a good hand, the player's expectation in high prize will be very slim, which induces decrease of interest in the game.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The same is also observed even in a card game with a side bet option described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,793,220. Namely, players can predict their possible prizes in a game as soon as cards, the number of which is predetermined depending on side bet condition, are dealt out. To be short, also in a card game with a side bet option, if a player does not hold a good hand, the player's expectation in high prize will be very slim, which induces decrease of interest in the game.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To address the above-discussed problems in the related art, it is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a card gaming machine and a card game playing method, in which winning or losing is judged by comparing player's hand and dealer's hand composed of a predetermined number of cards and a prize is awarded depending on the winning/losing result, on condition that a betting of a gaming value is made. In particular, the present invention relates to a card gaming machine and a card game playing method capable of raising players' expectation in prizes and interest in the card game by providing different prizes independent of the results of the winning/losing judgment in the case where a side bet of a gaming value is made.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one or more aspects of the present invention there is provided a card gaming machine comprising: a display for showing a plurality of cards; an operating unit for receiving an input of information from a player; and a game controller executing the steps of: (a) receiving a betting of a gaming value made by the player; (b) making winning/losing judgment by comparing a player's hand consisting of cards associated with the player with a dealer's hand consisting of cards associated with the dealer, among a plurality of cards displayed on the display; (c) awarding to the player a first prize that is based on a betted gaming value and a result of the winning/losing judgment; (d) receiving a side bet of a gaming value made by the player; (e) in a case where the side bet is made, specifying a bonus target card group that consists of a first predetermined number of cards included in the dealer's hand; (f) judging whether or not the bonus target card group forms a predetermined combination; and (g) in a case where the bonus target card group forms the predetermined combination, awarding a second prize responsive to the predetermined combination.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the inventive card gaming machine, the plurality of cards shown in the display are associated as either a player's hand or a dealer's hand based on a gaming value betted by the player and operation at the operating unit. In the card gaming machine, winning/losing judgment is made by comparing the player's hand with the dealer's hand. A first prize is awarded to the player based on a result of the winning/losing judgment and the betted gaming value.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In case a side bet of a gaming value is made, a bonus target card group is specified in the card gaming machine. In case the bonus target card group forms a predetermined combination, a second prize responsive to the predetermined combination is awarded. Thereby, the player who has made a side bet is given a chance to win a second prize irrespective of presence/absence of the first prize. The card gaming machine can raise the player's expectation in prizes and interest in the card game.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The bonus target card group is specified from the dealer's hand. That is, presence/absence of the second prize based on the bonus target card group is determined by the dealer's hand, irrespective of the player's hand. As a result, when the player who has made a side bet finds out his/her player's hand, he/she cannot easily specify the bonus target card group. That is, the player cannot easily anticipate presence/absence of the second prize. Thereby, the card gaming machine can raise the player's expectation in the second prize and interest in the card game.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, since &#x201c;a second prize is awarded irrespective of presence/absence of a first prize&#x201d; and &#x201c;a player cannot find out presence/absence of the second prize and contents of the second prize from his/her player's hand&#x201d;, the card gaming machine can raise the player's expectation in a high valued prize and interest in the card game.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one or more aspects of the present invention, there is provided a card gaming machine comprising: a display for showing a plurality of cards; an operating unit for receiving an input of information from a player; and a game controller executing the steps of: (a) receiving a betting of a gaming value made by a player; (b) associating a player's hand which consists of a second predetermined number of cards included in the plurality of cards displayed in the display with the player and associating a dealer's hand which consisting of the second predetermined number of cards included in the plurality of cards with a dealer; (c) specifying a player's high hand consisting of cards included in the player's hand and a player's low hand consisting of cards other than the player's high hand in the player's hand; (d) determining a dealer's high hand consisting of cards included in the dealer's hand and a dealer's low hand consisting of cards other than the dealer's high hand in the dealer's hand; (e) making winning/losing judgment by comparing the player's high hand with the dealer's high hand, and comparing the player's low hand with the dealer's low hand; (f) awarding to the player a first prize that is based on a betted gaming value and a result of the winning/losing judgment; (g) receiving a side bet of a gaming value made by the player; (h) in a case where the side bet is made by the player, specifying a bonus target card group that consists of a first predetermined number of cards included in the dealer's high hand; (i) judging whether or not the bonus target card group forms a predetermined combination; and (j) in a case where the bonus target card group forms the predetermined combination, awarding a second prize responsive to the predetermined combination.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the inventive card gaming machine, the plurality of cards shown in the display are associated as either a player's hand or a dealer's hand based on a gaming value betted by the player and operation at the operating unit. By means of the operating unit, a player's high hand and a player's low hand are specified from the player's hand. On the other hand, a dealer's high hand and a dealer's low hand are specified from the dealer's hand. Next, in the card gaming machine, winning/losing judgment is made by comparing the player's high hand and the player's low hand with the dealer's high hand and dealer's low hand, respectively. A first prize is awarded based on a result of the winning/losing judgment and the betted gaming value.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In case a side bet of a gaming value is made, a bonus target card group is specified in the card gaming machine. In case the bonus target card group forms a predetermined combination, a second prize responsive to the predetermined combination is awarded to the player. Therefore, a chance of winning a second prize is awarded to a player who has made a side bet, irrespective of presence/absence of the first prize. Thereby, the card gaming machine can raise the player's expectation in prizes and interest in the card game.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The bonus target card group is specified from a dealer's high hand that is a part of the dealer's hand. That is, presence/absence of the second prize based on the bonus target card group is determined by the dealer's hand only. As a result, when the player who has made a side bet finds out his/her player's hand, he/she cannot easily specify the bonus target card group. That is, the player cannot easily anticipate presence/absence of the second prize. Thereby, the card gaming machine can raise the player's expectation in the second prize and interest in the card game.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The dealer's high hand is a part of the dealer's hand. Therefore, the bonus target card group is specified from a card group in which the number of cards is smaller than that of the dealer's hand. Thereby, the bonus target card group (i.e., the first card group and the second card group) can be easily specified.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, since &#x201c;a second prize is awarded irrespective of presence/absence of a first prize&#x201d; and &#x201c;a player cannot easily find out presence/absence of the second prize and contents of the second prize from his/her player's hand&#x201d;, the card gaming machine can raise the player's expectation in a high valued prize and interest in the card game.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one or more aspects of the present invention, there is provided a card game playing method comprising the steps of: (a) receiving a betting of a gaming value made by a player; (b) dealing a player's hand consisting of a second predetermined number of cards and a dealer's hand consisting of the second predetermined number of cards to the player and a dealer, respectively; (c) making winning/losing judgment by comparing the player's hand with the dealer's hand; (d) awarding to the player a first prize that is based on a betted gaming value and a result of the winning/losing judgment; (e) receiving a side bet of a gaming value made by the player; (f) in a case where the side bet is made by the player, specifying a bonus target card group that consists of a first predetermined number of cards included in the dealer's hand; (g) judging whether or not the bonus target card group forms a predetermined combination; and (h) in a case where the bonus target card group forms the predetermined combination, awarding a second prize responsive to the predetermined combination.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the inventive card gaming playing method, betting of a gaming value is made by a player. After that, winning/losing judgment is made by comparing a player's hand and a dealer's hand. A first prize is awarded to the player based on a result of the winning/losing judgment and the betted gaming value.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In case a side bet of a gaming value is made, it is judged whether a bonus target card group specified from plural cards forms a predetermined combination. In case the bonus target card group forms the predetermined combination, a second prize responsive to the predetermined combination is awarded. Thereby, a chance of winning a second prize is awarded to a player who has made a side bet, irrespective of presence/absence of the first prize. Thereby, the card game playing method can raise the player's expectation in prizes and interest in the card game.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the card gaming playing method, the bonus target card group is specified from the dealer's hand. As a result, when the player who has made a side bet finds out his/her player's hand, he/she cannot easily specify the second card group. Thereby, the card game playing method can raise the player's expectation in the second prize and interest in the card game.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, since &#x201c;a second prize is awarded irrespective of presence/absence of a first prize&#x201d; and &#x201c;a player cannot easily find out presence/absence of the second prize and contents of the second prize from his/her player's hand&#x201d;, the card game playing method can raise the player's expectation in a high valued prize and interest in the card game.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one or more aspects of the present invention, there is provided a card game playing method comprising the steps of: (a) receiving a betting of a gaming value made by the player; (b) dealing a player's hand consisting of a second predetermined number of cards and a dealer's hand consisting of the second predetermined number of cards to the player and a dealer, respectively; (c) specifying a player's high hand consisting of cards included in the player's hand and a player's low hand consisting of cards other than the player's high hand in the player's hand; (d) determining a dealer's high hand consisting of cards included in the dealer's hand and a dealer's low hand consisting of cards other than the dealer's high hand in the dealer's hand; (e) making winning/losing judgment by comparing the player's high hand with the dealer's high hand, and comparing the player's low hand with the dealer's low hand; (f) awarding to the player a first prize that is based on a betted gaming value and a result of the winning/losing judgment; (g) receiving a side bet of a gaming value made by the player; (h) in a case where the side bet is made by the player, specifying a bonus target card group that consists of a first predetermined number of cards included in the dealer's high hand; (i) judging whether or not the bonus target card group forms a predetermined combination; and (j) in a case where the bonus target card group forms the predetermined combination, awarding a second prize responsive to the predetermined combination.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the inventive card game playing method, a player's hand and a dealer's hand are dealt out based on betting of gaming value made by a player. A player's high hand and a player's low hand are specified from a player's hand. On the other hand, a dealer's high hand and a dealer's low hand are specified from a dealer's hand. Winning/losing judgment is made by comparing the player's high hand and the player's low hand with the dealer's high hand and the dealer's low hand, respectively. A first prize is awarded to the player based on a result of the winning/losing judgment and the betted gaming value.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In case a side bet of a gaming value is made, a bonus target card group is specified. In case the bonus target card group forms a predetermined combination, a second prize responsive to the predetermined combination is awarded to the player. Therefore, a chance of winning a second prize is awarded to a player who has made a side bet, irrespective of presence/absence of the first prize. Thereby, the card game playing method can raise the player's expectation in prizes and interest in the card game.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The bonus target card group is specified from the dealer's high hand included in the dealer's hand. As a result when a player who has made a side bet finds out his/her player's hand, he/she cannot specify a bonus target card group. That is, the player cannot easily anticipate presence/absence of the second prize. Thereby, the card game playing method can raise the player's expectation in the second prize and interest in the card game. Furthermore, the dealer's high hand is a part of the dealer's hand. Accordingly, in the card game playing method, the bonus target card group can be specified more easily.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, since &#x201c;a second prize is awarded irrespective of presence/absence of a first prize&#x201d; and &#x201c;a player cannot find out present/absence of the second prize and contents of the second prize from his/her player's hand&#x201d;, the card game playing method can raise the player's expectation in a high valued prize and interest in the card game.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A embodiment of a card gaming machine of the present invention implemented as a multi-user card gaming machine will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">First, a card gaming machine <b>1</b> according to an embodiment will be outlined in detail with reference to drawings. As aforementioned, the card gaming machine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment is a kind of multi-user card game machines (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Thus, the card gaming machine <b>1</b> comprises a plurality of terminals <b>4</b> to receive inputs from players.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">And Pai Gow Poker, one of card games, is played in the card gaming machine. First, each player bets a predetermined number of chips. Then seven cards are dealt to each player as a player's hand. Players set classify their cards into a set of a five-card (high hand) and a two-card (low hand). The players' hands are then compared with the dealer's hand to judge winning/losing. In this regard, the dealer's hand is also composed of seven cards as same as the player's hand, and divided into a two-card low hand and a five-card high hand (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">If a player has higher hand in both high hand and low hand than the dealer's hands, it is judged as player's winning and a payout is made according to be t amount. If a player has only one higher hand (either high hand or low hand) than the dealer's, it is judged as draw. And if a player has lower hands in both high and low hands than the dealer's hands, it is judged as player's losing.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a game played in the card gaming machine <b>1</b> of this embodiment, in a case where the side bet is made, a predetermined number of cards (five cards in this embodiment) are selected out of the dealer's hand. A bonus target card group is composed of these five cards. The bonus target card group determines a prize as a bonus payout by judging whether a predetermined combination (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) is formed or not. Next, a player awarded a prize as a bonus payout responsive to the predetermined combination that formed in the bonus target card group.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For instance, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, from the dealer's hand that consists of seven cards, a set of five cards that compose the dealer's high hand is selected and determined as the bonus target card group. In case of an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bonus target card group is composed of five cards, namely, &#x201c;Jack of Diamonds&#x201d;, &#x201c;Jack of Spades&#x201d;, &#x201c;6 of Hearts&#x201d;, &#x201c;5 of Diamonds&#x201d; and &#x201c;2 of Clubs&#x201d;). In this case, the bonus target card group has one pair (i.e. a pair of &#x201c;Jack of Diamonds&#x201d; and &#x201c;Jack of Spades&#x201d;). Thus, the bonus target card group has a &#x201c;One Pair&#x201d; combination (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), so &#x201c;10&#x201d; credits are awarded to a player as a bonus payout, irrespective of presence/absence of prize in Pai Gow Poker (i.e. winning/losing judgment result).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The card gaming machine <b>1</b> of this embodiment may award a bonus payout, irrespective of presence/absence of prize in Pai Gow Poker. In this way, the card gaming machine <b>1</b> contributes to increasing expectation for the payout and improving interest in the game.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Particularly, the bonus target card group is characterized by five cards that are selected from the dealer's hand. Therefore, it is difficult for players to figure out whether there would be a bonus payout or a value of prize for the bonus payout. In other words, with this type of the card gaming machine <b>1</b>, players may have expectations and tense excitement for high payouts, being brimming over with enthusiasm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The following will now explain the overall construction of the card gaming machine <b>1</b> of this embodiment in further detail with reference to drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exterior view of the card gaming machine <b>1</b> according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The card gaming machine <b>1</b> of this embodiment basically includes a table portion and a panel <b>3</b>. The table portion <b>2</b> is for a player to play a game, while sitting down. The panel <b>3</b> is placed on backward of the table portion <b>2</b>. The panel <b>3</b> displays, say, an animation image of a virtual dealer.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the table portion <b>2</b> consists of a plurality of (e.g., five) terminals <b>4</b> placed on fan-shaped. Each terminal <b>4</b> is also called a satellite.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A description of the construction of the terminal <b>4</b> in the table portion <b>2</b> will now be given. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an exterior view of a terminal <b>4</b> according to the present invention. In this embodiment, all terminals have the same construction.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the terminal <b>4</b> comprises a liquid crystal display <b>10</b>, a touch panel <b>11</b>, operating buttons <b>12</b>, a coin slot <b>13</b>, a bill slot <b>14</b>, and a coin payout tray <b>15</b>. The liquid crystal display <b>10</b> is a display device to display a game screen (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, which will be described later), a bonus game screen (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 14</figref>, which will be described later), game results and so on. The touch panel <b>11</b> is disposed at the front surface of the liquid crystal display <b>10</b>. The touch panel <b>11</b> is used to press buttons shown on the liquid crystal display <b>10</b> for choosing a bet target (bet or side bet) or setting a bet. That is to say, the touch panel <b>11</b> constitutes an operation unit for choosing a bet target or setting a bet. And the operating buttons <b>12</b> are used for a payout operation for example. The coin slot <b>13</b> is where coins or medals are inserted. Likewise, the bill slot <b>14</b> is where bills are inserted. The coin payout tray <b>15</b> is where coins or medals at an amount corresponding to the credit that has been deposited in result of actuating the payout operation are paid out to a player.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Meanwhile, the panel <b>3</b> is constituted by a front display <b>21</b>, speakers <b>22</b>, and LEDs <b>23</b>. The front display <b>21</b> displays all kinds of images required to play a card game. For instance, an animation image of a dealer who deals out cards or dispenses chips, or the dealer's hand may be displayed on the front display <b>21</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The speakers <b>22</b> are located on an upper portion of the front display <b>21</b> to output music and/or a sound effect along game progresses. And the LEDs <b>23</b> are lightened whenever needed for presentations to exert dramatic effects.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Moreover, a JP amount display section <b>24</b> is provided at an upper portion of the front display <b>21</b>. Here, in the card gaming machine <b>1</b> of this embodiment, 5% of bet amount is pooled in the pot. In the case that a player makes a side bet and has a card combination of a bonus target card group (to be described), &#x201c;Royal Straight Flush&#x201d;, the player wins a jackpot (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). In this case, the pooled amount is paid out at once. Further, the JP amount display section <b>24</b> shows a pooled amount currently pooled in a pot.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The card gaming machine <b>1</b> of this embodiment uses cards same as trump cards used widely. As a rule, each card has a &#x201c;suit&#x201d; and a &#x201c;number&#x201d; (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A &#x201c;suit&#x201d; indicates a symbol each trump card bears, and is divided into 4 categories like spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A &#x201c;number&#x201d; indicates a number or an alphabet printed on a trump card, and the numbers 1 to 13 are allocated, namely, A (Ace, which corresponds to 1), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (Jack, which corresponds to 11), Q (Queen, which corresponds to 12), and K (King, which corresponds to 13).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Therefore, in playing the trump card, a type of a card is specified based on combinations of &#x201c;suit&#x201d; and &#x201c;number&#x201d;. For instance, there are &#x201c;A of Hearts&#x201d;, &#x201c;K of Spades&#x201d;, etc. It is assumed that a full set or deck of cards is composed of 53 cards, namely, 52 cards, split evenly into four suites of 13 cards bearing one of 13 different numbers, plus 1 joker.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The following will now give a description on a method for playing a game with the card gaming machine <b>1</b>. First, a player is seated front of a terminal <b>4</b> to bet with desired amount of bet by using a betting screen displayed on the liquid crystal display <b>10</b>. At this time, the player can make a side bet for a game. Then in the front display <b>21</b>, an image of cards (e.g., seven cards) dealt to the dealer is displayed. Meanwhile, in a liquid crystal display <b>10</b> of each terminal <b>4</b>, an image of seven cards dealt to a player is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Then, at the terminal <b>4</b>, through the touch panel <b>11</b>, there is carried out division change operation. The division change operation is an operation in which combination of dividing player's hand into player's high hand and player's low hand is changed. Similarly, cards being dealt to the dealer are divided into the dealer's high hand and the dealer's low hand. Then high and low hands of the players are compared with the high and low hands of the dealer, so as to make winning/losing judgment based on number and symbol of individual card.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Based on the winning/losing judgment result, an image of declaring either player's winning or dealer's winning or an image of declaring draw game is displayed in the liquid crystal display <b>10</b> or the front display <b>21</b>. In each one of terminals <b>4</b>, if a player won the dealer, the player wins credits twice as large as the bet (the number of credits) he had placed. On the other hand, if a player lost the dealer, no prize is awarded to the player. And if a player ends in a draw against the dealer, the last bet is returned to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In playing Pai Gow Poker, if a player has made a side bet, the bonus target card group consisting of five cards is determined from the dealer's hand. If a player has a predetermined combination (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) for the bonus target card group, a bonus payout is awarded to the player according to the combination.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The construction of a control system in a card gaming machine <b>1</b> will now be explained in detail with reference to drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic block diagram of the control system in the card gaming machine <b>1</b> according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a card gaming machine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment comprises a main control section <b>31</b>, a plurality of terminals <b>4</b> connected to the main control section <b>31</b>, and all kinds of peripherals.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The main control section <b>31</b> comprises a microcomputer <b>45</b> as its core. Basically, the microcomputer <b>45</b> is constituted by CPU <b>41</b>, RAM <b>42</b>, ROM <b>43</b>, and a bus <b>44</b> for data transmission between them. And the ROM <b>43</b> stores all kinds of programs, data tables, etc., which are required to control the card gaming machine <b>1</b>. The CPU <b>41</b> is a processing unit to execute all kinds of control programs and has a key role in the control by the microcomputer <b>45</b>. The RAM <b>42</b> is a memory to temporarily store all data that have been processed in the CPU <b>41</b>. The ROM <b>43</b> memorizes image data of face-up and back of each of all the cards used as player's hand and the dealer's hand.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Here, the CPU <b>41</b> is connected to a image processing circuit <b>47</b>, an audio circuit <b>48</b>, an LED drive circuit <b>49</b>, and a communication interface <b>50</b>, respectively, through an I/O interface <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The image processing circuit <b>47</b> is to control a display pattern of the front display <b>21</b>, under control of the CPU <b>41</b>. That is, the CPU <b>41</b> controls display of the front display <b>21</b> through the image processing circuit <b>47</b> so that the front display <b>21</b> may display a dealer image <b>102</b> and so on (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The audio circuit <b>48</b> is to carry out drive control of the speakers <b>22</b>, under control of the CPU <b>41</b>. That is, the CPU <b>41</b> controls the speakers <b>22</b> through the audio circuit <b>48</b> so that the speakers <b>22</b> may output music and/or a sound effect as a game progresses. The LED drive circuit <b>49</b> is to control lighting pattern of LEDs <b>23</b>. That is, the CPU <b>41</b> controls the lighting state of LEDs <b>23</b> through the LED drive circuit <b>49</b> so that the LEDs may be lightened to bring a prepared presentation as a game progresses.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Lastly, the communication interface <b>50</b> is to transmit/receive all kinds of data between each one of terminals <b>4</b> and the main control section <b>31</b>. Therefore, all kinds of information such as information on betting operations from individual terminals <b>4</b> are communicated with the main control section <b>31</b> through the communication interface <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Next, a detailed description on the construction of a control system for a terminal <b>4</b> will be given. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic block diagram illustrating a control system for the terminal <b>4</b> according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the terminal <b>4</b> of this embodiment comprises a microcomputer <b>55</b> as its core. The microcomputer <b>55</b> is constituted by CPU <b>51</b>, RAM <b>52</b>, ROM <b>53</b>, and a bus <b>54</b> for data transmission between them. And the ROM <b>53</b> stores all kinds of programs, data tables, etc., which are required to control the terminal <b>4</b>. The CPU <b>51</b> is a processing unit to execute all kinds of control programs and has a key role in the control by the microcomputer <b>55</b>. The RAM <b>52</b> is a memory which temporarily stores all kinds of data having been operated in the CPU <b>51</b>, in addition to the number of credits currently being deposited at the terminal <b>4</b>, a bet target (i.e. bet or side bet) made by each player, and a bet (the number of credits) placed on the bet target.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Also, the CPU <b>51</b> is connected to a liquid crystal panel drive circuit <b>57</b>, a touch panel drive circuit <b>58</b>, a hopper drive circuit <b>59</b>, a payout completion signal circuit <b>60</b>, and a communication interface <b>61</b>, respectively, through an I/O interface <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The liquid crystal panel drive circuit <b>57</b> is connected to the Liquid crystal display <b>10</b>, through which a display pattern of the liquid crystal display <b>10</b> is controlled. The touch panel drive circuit <b>58</b> is connected to a touch panel <b>11</b>. The touch panel drive circuit <b>58</b> senses player operation on the touch panel <b>11</b> so that an appropriate control corresponding to the operation may be done. The hopper drive circuit <b>59</b> is connected to a hopper <b>62</b>, through which the hopper <b>62</b> is controlled when coins are paid out to the coin payout tray <b>15</b>. The payout completion signal circuit <b>60</b> is connected to a coin detector <b>63</b>. Thus, when the coin payout tray <b>15</b> receives a predetermined number of coins, the payout completion signal circuit <b>60</b> sends a payout completion signal to indicate that a payout has completely been made.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Finally, the communication interface <b>61</b> is used to transmit/receive all kinds of information between the terminal <b>4</b> and the main control section <b>31</b>. For example, bet information based on operation data that are outputted from the touch panel <b>11</b> is transmitted to the main control section <b>31</b> through the communication interface <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">There will be described a game screen <b>70</b> which is displayed in the liquid crystal display <b>10</b> of the terminal <b>4</b> in playing Pai Gow Poker using the card gaming machine <b>1</b> of this embodiment in detail with reference to a drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The card gaming machine <b>1</b> allows players to carry out all kinds of operations such as bet operation, division change operation by using the game screen <b>70</b> and the touch panel <b>11</b>. Here, bet operations include placing player's credits in a bet and/or a side bet by using the game screen <b>70</b> and the touch panel <b>11</b>. Moreover, the division change operation is to divide seven player's cards into desired combination of five cards of player's high hand and two cards of player's low hand by using the game screen <b>70</b> and the touch panel <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the game screen <b>70</b> comprises a player's hand display area <b>71</b>, a bet display area <b>73</b>, a side bet display area <b>78</b>, a pooled amount display area <b>74</b>, and an information display area.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The player's hand display area <b>71</b> shows seven cards being dealt to a player in playing Pai Gow Poker. To be more specific, the player's hand display area <b>71</b> is where face-up images <b>87</b> and back face images <b>88</b> of cards of a player (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) are displayed. The bet display area <b>73</b> shows a chip image <b>72</b> at an amount corresponding to the number of chips a player bet on Pai Gow Poker. The side bet display area <b>78</b> shows a chip image <b>72</b> bet on a side bet by a player. The pooled amount display area <b>74</b> shows a pooled amount in a pot.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Lastly, the information display area shows a variety of operating buttons such as bet buttons <b>75</b>, Repeat bet button <b>76</b>, etc., and information on a player such as a Bet amount display area <b>90</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As discussed earlier, the player's hand display area <b>71</b> is where face-up images <b>87</b> and back face images <b>88</b> of cards being dealt to a player are displayed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the back face images <b>88</b> do not show any number and suit. Needless to say, if back face images <b>88</b> are displayed, a player cannot see numbers and or suits of individual cards in the player's hand. On the other hand, face-up images <b>87</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> include numbers and suits. Thus, if face-up images <b>87</b> are displayed, a player can see numbers and suits of individual cards in the player's hand.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">When a game starts, the card gaming machine <b>1</b> provides back face images <b>88</b> of seven cards on the player's hand display area <b>71</b> of terminal <b>4</b> a player is seated at. And after a predetermined time period has lapsed, the back face images <b>88</b> of cards which were displayed on the player's hand display area <b>71</b> are turned over and replaced with face-up images <b>87</b>, correspondingly to the player's hand dealt the terminal <b>4</b>. That is to say, the player's hand display area <b>71</b> now shows seven cards that are dealt to a player playing at the terminal <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, by operating the touch panel <b>11</b>, the player's hand displayed in the player's had display area <b>71</b> can be divide and classified into player's high hand and player's low hand. It is to be noted that division into player's hand and player's low hand can be made freely.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">For instance, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, five cards arranged at the left hand side of the game screen <b>70</b> are designated as a player's high hand, while two cards arranged at the right hand side of the game screen <b>70</b> are designated as a player's low hand. At this time, a player operates the touch panel <b>11</b> to rearrange these seven cards displayed on the player's hand display area <b>71</b> to make a change in the high and low hands.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As described above, the bet display area <b>73</b> shows a chip image <b>72</b> corresponding to a bet amount bet by a player in playing Pai Gow Poker (e.g., chips equivalent to 10 credits as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>). To make a bet, a player chooses a bet amount by means of bet buttons <b>75</b> to be described later and touches a portion of the touch panel <b>11</b> corresponding to the bet display area <b>73</b> to determine bet amount. That is, the portion of the touch panel <b>11</b> assigned to the bet display area <b>73</b> functions as a bet target selecting unit (i.e. betting in Pai Gow Poker). The bet determined in this manner is then sent to the main control section <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The side bet display area <b>78</b> shows an chip image <b>72</b> at an amount corresponding to a bet amount bet as a side bet (e.g., chips equivalent to 10 credits as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). To make a side bet, a player chooses a bet amount by means of bet buttons <b>75</b> to be described later and touches a portion of the touch panel <b>11</b> corresponding to the side bet display area <b>78</b> to determine a bet amount for the side bet. That is, the portion of the touch panel <b>11</b> assigned to the side bet display area <b>78</b> also functions as a bet target (i.e. side bet) selecting unit. The bet determined in this manner is then sent to the main control section <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The pooled amount display area <b>74</b> is where a pooled amount pooled in a pot is displayed. In particular, the card gaming machine <b>1</b> of this embodiment pools 5% of a bet placed by a player in a pot.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, a plurality of bet buttons <b>75</b> (e.g., three different values of credits such as &#x201c;1&#x201d; credit, &#x201c;10&#x201d; credits, and &#x201c;100&#x201d; credits are provided in this embodiment) are disposed on the right hand side below the bet display area <b>73</b>. As such, a player can select bet amount in a game by touching these bet buttons <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In addition, a Repeat bet button <b>76</b> and an UNDO bet button <b>77</b> are provided above the bet buttons <b>75</b>. The player may bet the same amount of bet as before by touching the Repeat bet button <b>76</b>. The player may freely cancel a preceding bet operation by touching an UNDO bet button <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As one can see in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, there is a HELP button <b>84</b> on the left hand side below the bet display area <b>73</b>. The HELP button <b>84</b> is used when it is required to display how to operate the card gaming machine <b>1</b> in the liquid crystal display <b>10</b>. Also, there is a message area <b>85</b> on the right side of the HELP button <b>84</b>. The message area <b>85</b> provides a message to support a game to progress smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The bottom of the game screen <b>70</b> is provided with a bet amount display area <b>90</b>, a winning amount display area <b>91</b>, a credit amount display area <b>92</b>, a minimum bet amount display area <b>93</b>, a maximum bet amount display area <b>94</b>, and a side bet amount display area <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The bet amount display area <b>90</b> shows a total amount of bet placed on a current game of Pai Gow Poker by a player. The winning amount display area <b>91</b> shows an amount a player won as a prize. The credit amount display area <b>92</b> shows a value of credits currently available to a player. The minimum bet amount display area <b>93</b> shows a lower limit of a possible bet a player can place. The maximum bet amount display area <b>94</b> shows an upper limit of a possible bet a player can place. The Side Bet display area <b>97</b> shows an amount of the side bet made on a current game by a player.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the game screen <b>70</b> also comprises a winning/losing display area <b>95</b> above the player's hand display area <b>71</b>. The winning/losing display area <b>95</b> provides a winning/losing result between a player and the dealer in a last game. For example, if a player wins, the winning/losing display area <b>95</b> displays &#x201c;YOU WON!&#x201d; (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). On the contrary, if a player loses, a string, &#x201c;YOU LOST!&#x201d; is displayed. Meanwhile, if a game ends in a draw between a player and the dealer, &#x201c;DRAW&#x201d;, is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">A main screen <b>101</b> shown on a front display <b>21</b> in playing Pai Gow Poker with the card gaming machine <b>1</b> according to this embodiment will now be explained in reference to a drawing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an explanatory view of the main screen <b>101</b> that shows on the front display <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As described above, the card gaming machine <b>1</b> of this embodiment displays a dealer image <b>102</b> on the front display <b>21</b>. This dealer image <b>102</b> is a virtual image of the dealer, being animate in connection with the progress of a game. In this manner, the card gaming machine <b>1</b> can enhance sense of real game atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Also, the main screen <b>101</b> provides a dealer's hand image <b>103</b> at its central portion. This dealer's hand image <b>103</b> shows cards dealt to the dealer. In this card gaming machine <b>1</b>, the dealer's hand is also composed of seven cards like each player's hand. According to house rules, the dealer's cards are arranged into a high hand and a low hand and displayed on the main screen <b>101</b>. In an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the top five cards belong to the dealer's high hand, and the bottom two cards belong to the dealer's low hand.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A game processing program in the card gaming machine <b>1</b> of this embodiment will now be explained in detail with reference to drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 11</figref> describe a game processing program executed by a CPU <b>41</b> of a main control section <b>31</b>, and a game processing program executed by a CPU <b>51</b> of a terminal <b>4</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">All the programs described in flow charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 11</figref> are stored either in RAM <b>42</b> or ROM <b>43</b> of the main control section <b>31</b> or in RAM <b>52</b> or ROM <b>53</b> of the terminal <b>4</b>, to be executed by the CPU <b>41</b> or the CPU <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">First, a game processing program executed in the main control section <b>31</b> will be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in S<b>1</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> sends each terminal <b>4</b> a command to start a betting period so that players may start a betting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Next, in S<b>2</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> receives bet information from each terminal <b>4</b>. Here, the bet information includes a bet amount (the number of credits) bet by a player. Moreover, the bet information includes information on whether there is a side bet in terminal <b>4</b> and side bet amount made on the side bet.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The bet information provided from the terminals <b>4</b> is temporarily stored in the RAM <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In S<b>3</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> determines whether a side bet is made during the betting period. To be more specific, the CPU <b>41</b> specifies the availability of a side bet, referring to the bet information received from each terminal <b>4</b> and stored in the RAM <b>42</b>. If a side bet was made (S<b>3</b>: YES), the CPU <b>41</b> matches a side bet flag indicating that a side bet has been made with a terminal <b>4</b> where the side bet is made and stores it in the RAM <b>42</b> (S<b>4</b>). Next, the CPU <b>41</b> proceeds to S<b>5</b>. On the contrary, if a side bet is not made (S<b>3</b>: NO), the CPU <b>41</b> proceeds directly to a subsequent S<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In S<b>5</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> carries out a dealer's hand lottery process. The dealer's hand lottery process (S<b>5</b>) is to determine seven cards (i.e. the dealer's hand) by a lottery. For instance, suppose that there is a deck of cards composed of N cards (N=53 in Pai Gow Poker). Then each one of cards in the deck is numbered from &#x201c;1&#x201d; through &#x201c;N&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">And the CPU <b>41</b> extracts seven random numbers from &#x201c;1&#x201d; through &#x201c;N&#x201d;, and sets seven cards corresponding to those extracted numbers as the dealer's hand (i.e. cards are dealt to the dealer).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In S<b>6</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> carries out a player's hand lottery process. Similar to dealer's hand lottery process (S<b>5</b>), the player's hand lottery process (S<b>6</b>) is to determine player's hand from a deck by a lottery.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">To be more specific, the CPU <b>41</b> extracts seven numbers from the remaining forty six cards except for the seven cards selected at the dealer's hand lottery process (S<b>5</b>). Then the CPU <b>41</b> sets seven cards corresponding to the thusly extracted numbers as a player's hand of the terminal <b>4</b> (i.e. cards are dealt to a player).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In case plural terminals <b>4</b> play the Pai Gow Poker concurrently, the above-described process is carried out for each terminals <b>4</b> that played the game. That is to say, the CPU <b>41</b> determines plural sets (i.e. corresponding to a number of terminals played the game) of the player's hand.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In S<b>7</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> transmits information on the players' hands (e.g., information on numbers and suits like &#x201c;7 of Hearts&#x201d; or &#x201c;Ace of Spades&#x201d;) determined by the lottery result at the player's hand lottery process (S<b>6</b>) to the terminal <b>4</b>. At this point in time, players' hands related to respective terminals <b>4</b> are dealt to the player (each terminal <b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">After transmitting the information on the players' hands (hereinafter, referred to as the &#x201c;player's hand information), the CPU <b>41</b> displays an animation image of the dealer dealing out seven cards to the player in the main screen <b>101</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the front display <b>21</b>, in dealer's image effect process (S<b>8</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">At this point in time of dealing cards, the dealer's hand should be hidden so the main screen <b>101</b> only shows an image of face-up-side-down cards (similar to the back face images <b>88</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Therefore, players cannot see numbers and kinds of suits on the dealer's cards.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Next, the CPU <b>41</b> receives information on high-hand and low-hand division of players' hands (S<b>9</b>). That is, in S<b>9</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> receives information on high-hand and low-hand division of players' hands in each terminal <b>4</b> (hereinafter, the information is referred to as &#x201c;player's hand division information&#x201d;), and stores information of each terminal <b>4</b> in the RAM <b>42</b>. In the card gaming machine <b>1</b> of this embodiment, a player can freely divide the player's hand into a five-card hand (high hand) and a two-card hand (low hand) at each terminal <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In S<b>10</b> the CPU <b>41</b> carries out a dealer's hand dividing process. The dealer's card dividing process (S<b>10</b>) is to divide seven dealer's cards determined at the dealer's hand lottery process (S<b>5</b>) into dealer's high hand and dealer's low hand. Here, the CPU <b>41</b> prosecutes to divide dealer's hand into dealer's high hand and dealer's low hand in accordance with predetermined house rules.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Upon determining the dealer's high and low hands, the CPU <b>41</b> also switches the back face images of the dealer's cards into face-up images on the main screen <b>101</b> of the front display <b>21</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Accordingly, players are now able to see numbers and suits on the dealer's cards (both high and low hands) displayed on the main screen <b>101</b> more clearly.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In S<b>11</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> executes a winning/losing judgment process. For the winning/losing judgment process (S<b>11</b>), the CPU <b>41</b> compares the dealer's high and low hands with each player's high and low hands, respectively, to determine winning/losing between a player and the dealer.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">To be more specific, the CPU <b>41</b> carries out winning/losing judgment according to a hand of cards. For instance, if both of the dealer's high hand and low hand are higher than player's high hand and low hand, it is player's losing. Meanwhile, if both of the player's high hand and low hand are higher than the dealer's high hand and low hand, the CPU <b>41</b> judges it as the player's winning. In other cases besides these two patterns, the CPU <b>41</b> judges it as a draw.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">While there are diverse kinds of hands of Pai Gow Poker, they are well known already, so explanations on them will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In S<b>12</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> sends results of the winning/losing judgment process (S<b>11</b>) to corresponding terminals <b>4</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">And the CPU <b>41</b> displays a notice image for notifying each terminal <b>4</b> of the winning/losing judgment result, in the main screen <b>101</b> of the front display <b>21</b> (S<b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In S<b>14</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> refers to the RAM <b>42</b> to decide whether a side bet flag is stored. That is, the CPU <b>41</b> judges whether there is a terminal <b>4</b> where a side bet was executed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">If a side bet flag is stored (S<b>14</b>: YES), the CPU <b>41</b> proceeds to S<b>15</b> to give a player an opportunity to win a bonus payout. On the other hand, if a side bet flag is not stored (S<b>14</b>: NO), the CPU <b>41</b> ends the game processing program as is. It is to be noted that the processing after S<b>15</b> is done only in a terminal <b>4</b> where a side bet was made. In other words, a terminal <b>4</b> where no side bet has been made is not provided with a chance to win a bonus payout, but enters standby mode until the processing from S<b>15</b> through S<b>19</b> are completed.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In S<b>15</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> transmits a dealer's hand information to a target terminal. The target terminal is a terminal <b>4</b> where a side bet was made. The dealer's hand information includes numbers and suits of individual cards composing a dealer's hand. And, the dealer's hand information also includes a classification of dealer's high hand and dealer's low hand in the dealer's hand.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">After transmitting the dealer's hand information to each target terminal, the CPU <b>41</b> proceeds to S<b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In S<b>16</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> carries out a bonus target card group determination process. The bonus target card group consists of five cards selected from seven cards composing the dealer's hand. The bonus target card group is made available for determining a presence/absence of bonus payout and a content of bonus payout.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The CPU <b>41</b> selects five cards composed of the bonus target card group from seven cards composing the dealer's hand. That is to say, the CPU <b>41</b> specifies five cards composed of the dealer's high hand. After that, the CPU <b>41</b> stores a bonus target information in RAM <b>42</b>. The bonus target information includes numbers and suits of individual cards composing the bonus target card group.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In the bonus target card group determination process (S<b>16</b>), when the CPU <b>41</b> determines a bonus target card group, the bonus target card group is composed by the dealer's high hand. However, the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">For instance, it is possible to determine the bonus target card group by selecting the most profitable cards (or best cards) from the dealer's hand consisting of seven cards. In this case, the CPU <b>41</b> selects a group of five cards to possibly compose a combination of the highest bonus payout as the bonus target card group at the bonus target card group determination process (S<b>16</b>). At this time, the CPU <b>41</b> selects the best cards based on the dealer's hand information stored in the RAM <b>42</b> and a bonus payout determination table (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, which will be described later).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In addition, determination of the bonus target card group is not limited to the manner of selecting best cards from the dealer's hand. It is possible to randomly select five cards for a bonus target card group in accordance with lotteries, thereby to determine the thus selected five cards as the bonus target card group.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Additionally, it is possible to make up a bonus target card group from three cards by combining two cards selected from the dealer's low hand and a card selected from the dealer's high hand.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In case that the bonus target card group is determined randomly, it is possible to determine a bonus target card group for each target terminal. In this case, a character of the bonus target card group differs by each of the target terminals. Thus, presence/absence of bonus payout and a content of bonus payout for a player differ among plural players in a shared game. In other words, it is possible to add variety of the bonus payout.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">After the bonus target card group determination process (S<b>16</b>), the CPU <b>41</b> transmits the bonus target information stored in RAM <b>42</b> to each target terminal (S<b>17</b>). After transmitting the bonus target information to each target terminal, the CPU <b>41</b> proceeds to S<b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In S<b>17</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> prosecutes to send the target terminal the bonus target information, whereby the liquid crystal display <b>10</b> of the target terminal shows card images of the bonus target card group (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 14</figref>). This point is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">After transmitting the bonus target information to the target terminal, the CPU <b>41</b> carries out a bonus judgment process with reference to the bonus target card group for the target terminal (S<b>18</b>). To be more specific, the CPU <b>41</b> acquires information on the numbers and suits of five cards that compose the bonus target card group of the target terminal from the RAM <b>42</b>. And the CPU <b>41</b> judges whether a predetermined winning combination defined in a bonus payout determination table (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) is formed or not, according to numbers and suits of the bonus target card group</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In case the bonus target card group forms a predetermined winning combination defined in the bonus payout determination table, prize corresponding to the winning combination is determined as &#x201c;bonus payout&#x201d;. In this regard, if the bonus target card group does not form in any combination defined in the bonus payout determination table, the CPU <b>41</b> sets the bonus payout to &#x201c;0&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The bonus payout determination table will now be explained in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. As listed <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the bonus payout determination table defines kinds of poker combinations such as &#x201c;Royal Straight Flush&#x201d;, &#x201c;Straight Flush&#x201d; and so on, as well as payouts corresponding to respective winning combination.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, &#x201c;15&#x201d; as a bonus payout is defined for &#x201c;Two Pairs&#x201d; according to the bonus payout determination table. Thus, if the bonus target card group forms the combination of &#x201c;Two Pairs&#x201d;, &#x201c;15&#x201d; credits are determined as a bonus payout. Since this principle is applied equally to the other combinations as well (e.g., &#x201c;Full House&#x201d;, &#x201c;Straight&#x201d;, etc.), detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Meanwhile, &#x201c;Jackpot&#x201d; is awarded for a combination of &#x201c;Royal Straight Flush&#x201d;. Therefore, if the bonus target card group forms the combination of &#x201c;Royal Straight Flush&#x201d;, a player wins the &#x201c;Jackpot&#x201d;. In this case, &#x201c;award of a pooled amount in a pot&#x201d; is determined as &#x201c;a bonus payout&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">After judging presence/absence of bonus payout and a content of bonus payout at the bonus judgment process (S<b>18</b>), the CPU <b>41</b> sends the bonus judgment result to the target terminal (S<b>19</b>). Here, the bonus judgment result includes information on a formed combination, a content of the bonus payout (e.g., the number of credits to be awarded), and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">After sending the bonus judgment result to the target terminal, the CPU <b>41</b> terminates the game processing program in the main control section <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The bonus judgment result being sent to the target terminal, a result of the bonus judgment process is displayed in the liquid crystal display <b>10</b> of the target terminal. The result of the bonus judgment process includes the formed winning combination, the content of bonus payout and so on. Further, in the target terminal, there is carried out various amusement effects (e.g., a video image effect on the liquid crystal display <b>10</b>) according to the bonus judgment result (S<b>118</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Finally, payout of prize acquired in the game is made at the target terminal in accordance with the winning/losing result and the bonus judgment result.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">A description on the game processing program executed in a terminal <b>4</b> will now be given in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, first of all, the CPU <b>51</b> of the terminal <b>4</b> receives a command to start a betting period from the main control section <b>31</b> (S<b>101</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Receiving the command to start a betting period, the CPU <b>51</b> also displays the game screen <b>70</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) on the liquid crystal display <b>10</b> and lets the betting period started (S<b>102</b>). The betting period is a period for accepting a bet and side bet made by a player. Therefore, acceptance of bet operation is started concurrently with start of the betting period. And the CPU <b>51</b> accepts bets for Pai Gow Poker and side bets based on the operation information from the touch panel <b>11</b> until termination of the betting period.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">After the betting period has started, the CPU <b>51</b> determined whether the betting period has ended (S<b>103</b>). In detail, the CPU <b>51</b> determines whether a predetermined period of time (e.g., 20 sec) from the start of accepting betting operations (i.e. receiving the command to start of the betting period) has lapsed. If the betting period has ended (S<b>103</b>: YES), the CPU <b>51</b> proceeds to S<b>104</b>. Meanwhile, if the betting period has not ended (S<b>103</b>: NO), the CPU <b>51</b> continues receiving betting operations.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">When the betting period is over, the CPU <b>51</b> stores current bet information in the RAM <b>52</b> and sends the bet information to the main control section <b>31</b> (S<b>104</b>). The bet information includes an amount of bet (the number of credits) placed by a player and information on a side bet.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Next, in S<b>105</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> receives a player's hand information. The player's hand information received in S<b>105</b> corresponds to the information transmitted from the main control section <b>31</b> in S<b>7</b>. Accordingly, the player's hand information includes numbers and suits (e.g., &#x201c;7 of Hearts&#x201d;, &#x201c;Ace of Spaces&#x201d;, etc.) on individual cards composing a player's hand.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Upon receiving the player's hand information, the CPU <b>51</b> displays the seven player's cards on the game screen <b>70</b> (S<b>106</b>). In S<b>106</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> displays back face images <b>88</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of those seven cards on the player's hand display area <b>71</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, players cannot see numbers and suits of the cards composing a player's hand. When a predetermined time (e.g., <b>3</b> sec) elapses from the display of back face images <b>88</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> shows face-up images <b>87</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the player's hand, based on numbers and suits included in the player's hand information. Now that face-up images <b>87</b> of the player's hand are shown, the player can see the numbers and suits on the cards.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In S<b>107</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> starts accepting division change operation on the player's hand displayed on the game screen <b>70</b>. This division change operation allows a player to change classification of player's high hand and player's low hand shown on the game screen <b>70</b>, through the operation of the touch panel <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In S<b>108</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> determines whether division change operation is done based on the operation information from the touch panel <b>11</b>. If a player carried out the division change operation (S<b>108</b>: YES), the CPU <b>51</b> executes the division change process (S<b>109</b>). In the division change process (S<b>109</b>), the CPU <b>51</b> changes the player's hand division information in accordance with the division change operation and reflects such changes in the arrangement of the players' hand on the game screen <b>70</b>. Here, the player's hand division information includes a classification of high hand and player's low hand in the player's hand. To be more specific, the player's hand division information includes the numbers and suits of individual cards that belong to a player's high hand and the numbers and suits on individual cards that belong to a player's low hand.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">On the other hand, if a player did not carry out the division change operation (S<b>108</b>: NO), the CPU <b>51</b> proceeds to S<b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In S<b>110</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> determines whether a predetermined period of time (e.g., <b>15</b> see) from the start of the operation accepting process (S<b>107</b>) has lapsed. If a predetermined period of time has lapsed (S<b>110</b>: YES), the CPU <b>51</b> sends player's hand division information to the main control section <b>31</b> (S<b>111</b>). On the other hand, if the predetermined period of time has not lapsed (S<b>110</b>: NO), the CPU <b>51</b> returns the process to S<b>108</b>. In this manner, a player can carry out the division change operation again so as to correct division of the player's high hand and low hand.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">After transmitting the player's hand division information to the main control section <b>31</b> (S<b>111</b>), the CPU <b>51</b> receives winning/losing judgment result from the main control section <b>31</b> (S<b>112</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Next, the CPU <b>51</b> displays the winning/losing judgment result on the liquid crystal display <b>10</b> of the terminal <b>4</b>, based on the received winning/losing judgment result (S<b>113</b>). In detail, the CPU <b>51</b> shows &#x201c;YOU WON!&#x201d;, &#x201c;DRAW&#x201d;, or &#x201c;YOU LOST!&#x201d; on the winning/losing display area <b>95</b> of the game screen <b>70</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), according to the winning/losing judgment result.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In addition, the winning/losing result being displayed at the winning/losing judgment result display process (S<b>113</b>) are for a Pai Gow Poker game and does not indicate presence/absence of a bonus payout.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In S<b>114</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> determines whether or not a side bet is made at the terminal <b>4</b> by referring to bet information stored in the RAM <b>52</b>. That is, in S<b>114</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> determines whether the terminal <b>4</b> is a &#x201c;target terminal&#x201d; mentioned earlier. If a side bet has been made (S<b>114</b>: YES), the CPU <b>51</b> proceeds to S<b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">However, if a side bet has not been made (S<b>114</b>: NO), the CPU <b>51</b> carries out a payout process (S<b>119</b>). In this case, the terminal <b>4</b> gets a payout according to the winning/losing judgment result of a Pai Gow Poker game.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In S<b>115</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> receives the dealer's hand information transmitted from the main control section <b>31</b>. And the CPU <b>51</b> displays a bonus game screen <b>80</b> on the liquid crystal display <b>10</b> of the terminal <b>4</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the face-up images of the dealer's hand in this game are displayed in the bonus game screen <b>80</b>, based on the dealer's hand information.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">As described above, the dealer's hand information includes numbers and suits of individual cards composing a dealer's hand and a classification of dealer's high hand and dealer's low hand in the dealer's hand. Therefore, the CPU <b>51</b> can display the dealer's hand in the bonus game screen <b>80</b> by referring to the received dealer's hand information. Thus, the dealer's hand is displayed in a classified state (i.e., the dealer's high hand and the dealer's low hand) for the purpose of the winning/losing judgment.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In S<b>116</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> receives bonus target information from the main control section <b>31</b>. And the CPU <b>51</b> prosecutes to display a bonus target card group on the bonus game screen <b>80</b>, based on the received bonus target information, and notify the player of the bonus target card group.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">To be more specific, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, among to the face-up images of dealer's hand displayed in the bonus game screen <b>80</b>, cards composing the bonus target card group and other cards are distinguishably indicated. In case of an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the CPU <b>51</b> displays the bonus target card group and other cards in different colors. In this way, a player can see which cards out of the seven cards composing the dealer's hand belong to the bonus target card group.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Later, the CPU <b>51</b> changes a display pattern on the bonus game screen <b>80</b> from a screen in which dealer's hand and low-hand are shown separately (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) to a screen in which only five cards composing the bonus target card group are shown (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). As such, the bonus game screen <b>80</b> displays only the bonus target card group, which helps a player to see the composition of the bonus target card group more clearly.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In S<b>117</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> receives bonus judgment result from the main control section <b>31</b>. Then CPU <b>51</b> displays the judgment results such as &#x201c;presence/absence of a bonus payout&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;a winning combination&#x201d; on the bonus game screen <b>80</b>, according to the bonus judgment result (S<b>118</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">For instance, referring to an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the bonus target card group includes a pair of &#x201c;J&#x201d;. Thus the bonus target card group forms a combination of &#x201c;One pair&#x201d;. Therefore, in S<b>118</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> displays a string of &#x201c;BONUS GET!&#x201d; on the winning/losing display area <b>95</b> and a string of &#x201c;One Pair&#x201d; as a winning combination on the bonus game screen <b>80</b> (S<b>118</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">After displaying the bonus judgment result on the bonus game screen <b>80</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> carries out a payout process (S<b>119</b>). In the payout process (S<b>119</b>), the CPU <b>51</b> carries out addition of credits or payout of coins based on winning/losing judgment result and the bonus judgment result. That is, in case the process shifts to the payout process (S<b>119</b>) from S<b>114</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> either adds credits or makes a coin payout based on the winning/losing judgment result only. Meanwhile, in case the process shifts to the payout process after the series of S<b>115</b>-S<b>118</b>, the CPU <b>51</b> carries out either addition of credits or payout of coins, based on the winning/losing judgment result and the bonus judgment result. That is, the CPU <b>51</b> awards to the player both &#x201c;payout based on a winning/losing judgment result&#x201d; and &#x201c;payout based on bonus judgment result&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">A payout based on the winning/losing judgment result corresponds to &#x201c;credits twice the bet&#x201d; if a player won the dealer, and &#x201c;credits same as the bet&#x201d; if the game was draw.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">As explained above, with the card gaming machine <b>1</b> and the card game playing method according to the present invention, Pai Gow Poker is played on the condition of a bet at the game value (e.g., credits or chips). That is, in the card gaming machine <b>1</b> and the card game playing method, player's hand and dealer's hand are associated with a player and a dealer, respectively. Then the players' hand and the dealer's hand are compared to judge winning/losing hands, and payout is made based on the winning/losing result and the bet amount (i.e. a payout based on the winning/losing judgment result) (S<b>119</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">According to the card gaming machine <b>1</b> and card game playing method of the present invention, if a side bet is made (S<b>14</b>: YES, S<b>114</b>: YES), the bonus target card group consisting of five cards is specified from the dealer's hand consisting of seven cards. For the bonus target card group, the bonus judgment process (S<b>18</b>) to find out whether the bonus target card group forms a predetermined winning combination defined in the bonus payout determination table (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) is carried out. And a bonus payout is awarded to a player according to the formed winning combination (S<b>119</b>). The winning/losing judgment process (S<b>12</b>) and the bonus determination process (S<b>20</b>) are carried out as two separate ones.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Therefore, a player who has made a side bet has a chance to win a bonus payout, irrespective of the winning/losing judgment result. Further, the card gaming machine <b>1</b> and card game playing method of the present invention can increase expectations of players for high payouts, thereby motivating them to get more excited about a game.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">A bonus target card group consists of cards selected from the dealer's high hand that is included in the dealer's hand. That is, the availability of a bonus payout and/or the contents of a bonus payout is not influenced by the composition of a player's hand (i.e., numbers and suits of the cards in the player's hand) but influenced by the composition of a dealer's hand. Thus, although a player who made a side bet knows his/her hand (e.g., at a point in time shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), it is not easy for him/her to figure out the composition of a bonus target card group. Consequently, it becomes very difficult to predict presence/absence of bonus payout and contents of a bonus payout. In the card gaming machine <b>1</b> and card game playing method of the present invention, a player's expectation to a bonus payout and enthusiasm on the game are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Also, considering the points that &#x201c;a bonus payout is made irrespective of the winning/losing judgment result&#x201d; and &#x201c;a player cannot easily figure out the presence/absence of a bonus payout and contents of a bonus payout&#x201d;, the card gaming machine <b>1</b> and card game playing method according to the present invention does give players great expectation to win high payouts and improve enthusiasm on the game.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Further, according to the card gaming machine <b>1</b> and card game playing method of the present invention, a third party besides players or a machine (e.g., a game controller or a dealer) determines the bonus target card group. That is to say, players are not involved in determining the bonus target card group. Since players do not determine the bonus target card group, there is no way for them to figure out a complete set of the bonus target card group. Again, this consequently helps players to enjoy a game even more, without reducing the excitement level in the game.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">According to the card gaming machine <b>1</b> and card game playing method of the present invention, the bonus target card group is specified after the numbers and suits of cards in the player's hand and the dealer's hand are disclosed. In this case, the bonus target card group is specified after the player grasps individual cards composing of the dealer's hand. Therefore, the card gaming machine <b>1</b> and card game playing method of the present invention provides tension on the game such as &#x201c;which cards in dealer's cards compose a bonus target card group&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Needless to say, the present invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments described hereto, and it should be understood that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">For instance, while the exemplary embodiment of the invention has fixed the number of cards composing a bonus target card group to five, the present invention is not limited thereto. That is, two or more cards are sufficient to create a variety of compositions for the bonus target card group.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In case that the bonus target card group consists of three cards, it is possible to create a variety of composition for the bonus target card group, even if three cards for the bonus target card group is selected from five cards composing of the dealer's high hand, in similar way of this embodiment. Thus, it is possible to diversify the presence/absence of bonus payout and a content of bonus payout in a game. Therefore, it is possible to give players great expectation for bonus payouts.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">While the exemplary embodiment of the invention makes the CPU <b>41</b> determine a bonus target card group, the present invention is not limited thereto. For instance, it is possible for a player to select cards composing of the bonus target card group. To be specific, a player himself/herself can operate the touch panel <b>11</b> of a target terminal and select cards to compose the bonus target card group from the dealer's hand.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In such case, a player may select the bonus target card group before or after the numbers and suits of cards in the dealer's hand are disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">For instance, in case it is arranged such that a player is allowed to select a bonus target card group before the numbers and suits of cards in the dealer's hand are disclosed, the player cannot grasp numbers and suits of the cards when selecting cards of the bonus target card group. Therefore, the player cannot anticipate what numbers and suits the cards in the bonus target card group are going to have. Consequently, these help players enjoy tense excitement about the availability of a bonus payout.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">On the other hand, in case a player is allowed to select cards of a the bonus target card group after the numbers and suits of cards in the dealer's hand are disclosed, the player may freely select cards for the bonus target card group while being aware of the numbers and suits of individual cards composing of the dealer's hand. In this case, intension of the player is reflected to a composition of the bonus target card group. By allowing a player to select cards for the bonus target card group after the numbers and suits on cards in the dealer's hand are disclosed, the bonus target card group may be composed more strategically.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the card game playing method of the invention can be applied to Pai Gow Poker (so-called a table game) where a dealer <b>202</b> and players (not shown) play a game on a game table <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In playing such a table game, the dealer <b>202</b> prepares a deck of cards and deals out cards to the dealer himself and each player on the game table <b>201</b>. Meanwhile, players place chips anywhere on the game table <b>201</b> to make a bet. Players can also make a side bet by applying the same method.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Further, the method used in the card gaming machine <b>1</b> of the invention can be applied in proceeding of the game of Pai Gow Poker, except that actual (not virtual) dealer and players themselves deals cards.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">If a player makes a side bet, the dealer specifies a bonus target card group from cards composing the dealer's high hand. Later, the dealer determines whether the bonus target card group forms a predetermined winning combination (i.e. a poker combination shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), and awards a winner a bonus payout (chips) according to the combination formed.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In this regard, even in case of the table game shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, if a player pooled some percentage of a bet in a pot and has a winning combination of &#x201c;Royal Straight Flush&#x201d; for the bonus target card group, the pooled amount may be paid out to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Moreover, the card gaming machine and card game playing method of the present invention can be applied not only to Pai Gow Poker, but also other kinds of card games categorized as poker such as Blackjack, Draw Poker, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a system for treating vascular disease. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system for treating a lesion at a bifurcation in the vasculature.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vascular disease currently represents a prevalent medical condition. Typical vascular disease involves the development of a stenosis in the vasculature. The particular vessel containing the stenosis can be completely blocked (or occluded) or it can simply be narrowed (or restricted). In either case, restriction of the vessel caused by the stenotic lesion results in many well known problems caused by the reduction or cessation of blood circulation through the restricted vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A bifurcation is an area of the vasculature where a first (or parent) vessel is bifurcated into two or more branch vessels. It is not uncommon for stenotic lesions to form in such bifurcations. The stenotic lesions can affect only one of the vessels (i.e., either of the branch vessels or the parent vessel), two of the vessels, or all branch vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A number of different procedures have been developed to treat a stenotic lesion (stenosis) in the vasculature. The first is to deform the stenosis to reduce the restriction within the lumen of the blood vessel. This type of deformation (or dilatation) is typically performed using balloon angioplasty.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, when the lesion is formed in a bifurcation, conventional balloon angioplasty can be somewhat cumbersome. In some cases, two separate guidewires are used. However, where only one guidewire is used, the guidewire is first introduced into one of the branch vessels of the bifurcation. The dilatation balloon is then advanced over the guidewire so the distal end of the dilatation balloon is in the branch vessel. The balloon is then inflated a number of times, in a known manner, to accomplish dilatation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The balloon is then withdrawn proximal of the bifurcation. The guidewire is then withdrawn and manipulated into the other branch vessel of the bifurcation. The balloon is then advanced over the guidewire, again, and inflated to dilate the second branch vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Not only is this process somewhat cumbersome, other problems result as well. For example, when the angle between the branch vessels in the bifurcation is fairly small, inflation of the dilatation balloon in one branch vessel can cause the ostium of the other branch vessel to collapse. This results in ineffective dilatation by restricting flow to the other branch vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, locating both branch vessels can be quite difficult. For example, once the first branch vessel is located under conventional visualization techniques (such as with the use of contrast medium), that vessel is dilated. After withdrawing both the guidewire and the dilatation catheter proximal of the bifurcation, the physician must then attempt to locate the second branch vessel. This can require the introduction of other devices into the vasculature and the region of the bifurcation. This can be somewhat cumbersome.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Vascular stents are also currently well known, and are deployed as another technique for treating vascular lesions. Vascular stents typically involve a tubular stent which is movable from a collapsed, low profile, delivery position to an expanded, deployed position. The stent is typically delivered using a stent delivery device, such as a stent delivery catheter. In one common technique, the stent is crimped down to its delivery position over an expandable element, such as a stent deployment balloon. The stent is then advanced (using the catheter attached to the stent deployment balloon) to the lesion site under any suitable, commonly known visualization technique. The balloon is then expanded to drive the stent from its delivery position to its deployed position in which the outer periphery of the stent frictionally engages the inner periphery of the lumen. In some instances, the lumen is predilated using a conventional dilatation catheter, and then the stent is deployed to maintain the vessel in an unoccluded, and unrestricted position.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">While there have recently been considerable advances in stent design and stent deployment techniques, there is currently no adequate method of treating bifurcation lesions, particularly where both downstream branch vessels are affected by the lesion. Current techniques of dealing with such lesions typically require the deployment of a slotted tube stent across the bifurcation. However, this compromises the ostium of the unstented branch.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, once the first stent is deployed, the treating physician may then advance a dilatation balloon between the struts of the stent already deployed in order to dilate the second branch vessel. The physician must then attempt to maneuver a second stent through the struts of the stent already deployed, into the second branch vessel for deployment. This presents significant difficulties. For example, dilating between the struts of the stent already deployed tends to distort that stent. Further, deploying the second stent through the struts of the first stent is not only difficult, but it can also distort the first stent.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a bifurcation <b>10</b> which includes parent vessel <b>12</b>, first branch vessel <b>14</b> and second branch vessel <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates that a bifurcation lesion <b>18</b> has developed in bifurcation <b>10</b>. Lesion <b>18</b> illustrates one common bifurcation lesion in that it extends up into parent vessel <b>12</b> and down into both branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate a dilatation and stent deployment device <b>20</b> in accordance with one aspect of the present invention. Device <b>20</b> includes a first sheath <b>22</b>, and a pair of dilatation balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. Each dilatation balloon <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> is coupled to a balloon catheter <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>, respectively, both of which fit within sheath <b>22</b>. It should also be noted that sheath <b>22</b> can be a separate member preferably fixedly disposed about balloon catheters <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> or can be a dual lumen extrusion which forms part of catheters <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>. In a preferred embodiment, balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are similar in construction. Balloon <b>24</b> preferably includes proximal end <b>32</b> and distal end <b>34</b> with an intermediate portion <b>36</b> therebetween. The region of balloon <b>24</b> between proximal end <b>32</b> and intermediate portion <b>36</b> preferably forms a smaller diameter (or narrower) balloon segment <b>38</b>. The region of balloon <b>24</b> between intermediate portion <b>36</b> and distal end <b>34</b> preferably forms a larger diameter balloon segment <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Similarly, balloon <b>26</b> preferably has a proximal end <b>42</b>, a distal end <b>44</b>, and an intermediate portion <b>46</b> therebetween. The region between proximal end <b>42</b> and intermediate region <b>46</b> preferably forms a smaller diameter (or narrower) balloon segment <b>48</b>, while the portion of balloon between intermediate region <b>46</b> and distal end <b>44</b> preferably forms a larger diameter balloon segment <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As will be described in greater detail later in the specification, smaller diameter balloon segments <b>38</b> and <b>48</b> are preferably formed to reside adjacent one another in parent vessel <b>12</b>, while larger diameter balloon segments <b>40</b> and <b>50</b> preferably reside in branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, during dilatation and stent deployment.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one preferred embodiment, intermediate section <b>46</b> of balloon <b>26</b> is simply a necked down diameter reduction area which smoothly transitions the outer diameter of balloon <b>26</b> from the larger diameter of balloon segment <b>50</b> to the smaller diameter of balloon segment <b>48</b>. Similarly, intermediate section <b>36</b> is a necked down portion which transitions the outer diameter of balloon <b>24</b> from the large diameter balloon segment <b>40</b> to the smaller diameter balloon segment <b>38</b>. Further, intermediate section <b>46</b> preferably (and optionally) includes a preformed bend section <b>62</b>. Preformed bend section <b>62</b> is preferably formed such that distal end <b>44</b> of balloon <b>26</b> extends away from distal end <b>34</b> of balloon <b>24</b> at any desired angle .alpha. In one preferred embodiment, .alpha. is in a range of approximately 30.degree.-70.degree., while in another preferred embodiment, .alpha. is in a range of approximately 45.degree.-60.degree. In any case, upon inflation of balloon <b>26</b>, preformed bend region <b>62</b> causes balloon <b>26</b> to deform in the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 6</figref> such that it can more easily find branch vessel <b>16</b>, and track guidewire <b>60</b> into branch vessel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a cross-sectional end view of balloon <b>24</b> taken along section lines <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> further illustrating the construction of balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. Both balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are similar with respect to the view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Therefore, only balloon <b>24</b> will be described, for the sake of clarity. Balloon <b>24</b> preferably includes an outer wall <b>52</b> of expandable balloon material. Balloon <b>24</b> also preferably includes an inner guidewire lumen <b>54</b>, and an inflation lumen <b>56</b>. In one preferred embodiment, guidewire lumen <b>54</b> and inflation lumen <b>56</b> are coaxially aligned with guidewire lumen <b>54</b> disposed within inflation lumen <b>56</b>. Inflation lumen <b>56</b> terminates at a proximal region of balloon <b>24</b> while guidewire lumen <b>54</b> extends through balloon <b>24</b> and is bonded to the distal end thereof. In one preferred embodiment, the length from the distal tip of balloon <b>24</b> to the distal end of sheath <b>22</b> measures approximately 25 cm. Both guidewire lumen <b>54</b> and inflation lumen <b>56</b> extend from balloon <b>24</b> all the way to a proximal end of sheath <b>22</b>, which preferably resides outside the body during dilatation and stent delivery. However, in another preferred embodiment, only inflation lumen <b>56</b> extends all the way to the proximal end of sheath <b>22</b>, while guidewire lumen <b>54</b> is of a monorail construction which has a proximal ostium proximal of balloon <b>24</b>, and has a distal ostium in the region of the distal tip <b>34</b> of balloon <b>24</b>. In yet another embodiment, the inflation lumens of both balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are combined proximal of the balloons to accommodate simultaneous inflation of balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In any case, both balloons can also have an inflation lumen and a guidewire lumen, so they are suitable for independent inflation, and for tracking of separate guidewires. It should also be noted that, in the preferred embodiment, when balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are in the deflated, insertion position, they obtain a low enough profile to both fit within a guide catheter (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> illustrate dilatation of bifurcation <b>10</b> in accordance with one aspect of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates that, in a first step, two guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are first introduced into the vasculature (such as through a femoral artery and a guide catheter) and are advanced to bifurcation <b>10</b>. Guidewire <b>58</b> is manipulated such that it is advanced down branch vessel <b>14</b>, while guidewire <b>60</b> is manipulated to be advanced down branch vessel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Once guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are positioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, device <b>20</b> is then advanced over guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>. This is illustrated in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Device <b>20</b> is preferably preloaded, or backloaded, onto guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> with balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> in the deflated position. Thus, guidewire <b>58</b> extends through the guidewire lumen in balloon <b>24</b>, while guidewire <b>60</b> extends through the guidewire lumen in balloon <b>26</b>. Sheath <b>22</b> and balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are then advanced over guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> to bifurcation <b>10</b>. The insertion of device <b>20</b> is preferably observed by the treating physician under any suitable visualization technique, such as through the introduction of contrast medium, or fluoroscopy, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates that balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are then advanced over guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> until the distal tips <b>34</b> and <b>44</b> of balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> reside at a desirable location within branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively. In one preferred embodiment, balloons <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>, and their corresponding catheters <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>, are movable independently of one another. However, in another preferred embodiment, they are fixed relative to one another and sheath <b>22</b> and move as a unitary member. Balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> can be positioned as desired by the treating physician, in order to accomplish optimal dilatation, based upon the size and location of bifurcation <b>10</b>, and the size of lesion <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are positioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, they are inflated to accomplish dilatation of bifurcation <b>10</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also illustrates that the two smaller diameter balloon segments <b>38</b> and <b>48</b> combine to provide dilatation force in parent vessel <b>12</b> of bifurcation <b>10</b>. In addition, larger diameter balloon segments <b>40</b> and <b>50</b> extend within branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively, to dilate lesion <b>18</b> in those vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Once placed in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and inflated, balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> can be deflated and re-inflated any desired number of times, to accomplish optimal dilatation. Once dilatation has been accomplished, balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are preferably deflated, and withdrawn proximally over guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> and removed from the vasculature.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, after the dilatation illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it may be desirable to deploy a stent in bifurcation <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> illustrate a stent which can be deployed by device <b>20</b> in bifurcation <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates that the bifurcation stent preferably includes a first stent portion <b>64</b>. Stent portion <b>64</b> can be any suitable, and commercially available stent, such a Palmaz-Schatz stent or an NIR stent. Stent <b>64</b> preferably includes a tubular structural wall <b>66</b>. Wall <b>66</b> preferably has an aperture <b>68</b> formed therein, near a midregion of stent <b>64</b>, between a first end <b>70</b> and a second end <b>72</b> thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates that the bifurcated stent also preferably includes a second stent portion <b>74</b>. Second stent portion <b>74</b> preferably has a first end <b>76</b> and a second end <b>78</b>, wherein the first end <b>76</b> is cut at an angle relative to the longitudinal axis of stent <b>74</b>. First end <b>76</b> is preferably coupled to stent <b>64</b> about aperture <b>68</b>, thus forming a bifurcated stent having a first portion <b>80</b> which is configured to reside in the parent vessel, and two depending portions <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> which are configured to be received within branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another preferred embodiment, the stent is manufactured as one integral stent having a conformation with a main section and two depending leg sections.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to deploy the bifurcated stent illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the stent is first preloaded onto device <b>20</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>) such that first portion <b>80</b> is disposed over the smaller diameter balloon segments <b>38</b> and <b>48</b> of balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, respectively. Also, depending portions <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> are preferably disposed over the larger diameter balloon segments <b>40</b> and <b>50</b>. Of course, the bifurcated stent is preferably loaded onto device <b>20</b> while the balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are in the deflated position and the stent is crimped down over balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> for delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, (either before or after the bifurcated stent is disposed thereon) are backloaded onto guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>. Device <b>20</b> is then advanced through the vasculature (in the same manner as indicated above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>) until balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, with a bifurcated stent mounted thereon, are disposed in bifurcation <b>10</b> in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Balloons <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are then inflated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. This drives the bifurcated stent from a collapsed, insertion position to a radially expanded, deployed position in which the outer periphery of the tubular structure <b>66</b> frictionally engages the inner periphery of the lumen walls of both branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, and of parent vessel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thus, it can be seen that device <b>20</b> provides significant advantages over prior bifurcation dilatation and stent deployment techniques. For example, device <b>20</b> is capable of dilating both branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> at the same time. Similarly, device <b>20</b> is capable of deploying a stent in both branch vessels at the same time. This significantly reduces the likelihood that either of the branch vessels <b>14</b> or <b>16</b> will collapse during dilatation and stent deployment. Further, both dilatation and stent deployment can be accomplished without removing either of the guidewires <b>58</b> or <b>60</b>, or without repositioning either of the guidewires. Rather, the guidewires simply need to be placed at the appropriate positions within branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, and left throughout both dilatation and stent deployment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10C</figref> illustrate another bifurcation dilatation device <b>86</b> in accordance with another aspect of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along section lines <b>10</b>B-<b>10</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref> is a view rotated 90.degree. about the longitudinal axis relative to the view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. Device <b>86</b> includes guidewire sheath <b>88</b>, catheter <b>90</b>, and balloon <b>92</b>. Sheath <b>88</b> is preferably a separate member from catheter <b>90</b> and balloon <b>92</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> also shows both guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>. Guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are preferably approximately 0.010 inches in diameter, but can have any suitable guidewire dimensions. Guidewire sheath <b>88</b> is preferably simply a sheath (typically polyethylene) which is disposed about guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>, and is sized to be advanced over guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> through the vasculature, to bifurcation <b>10</b>, preferably through a guide catheter (not shown). Sheath <b>88</b> can also be implemented as a dual lumen sheath wherein a guidewire is received in each lumen. This helps prevent the guidewires from entangling. Balloon <b>92</b> preferably includes a proximal end <b>100</b> and a distal end <b>104</b> and is eccentrically located on shaft <b>90</b>. Distal end <b>104</b> is preferably disposed just proximal of the distal tip of shaft <b>90</b>. Balloon <b>92</b> and the lumens <b>93</b> and <b>94</b> can be formed by using a triple lumen extrusion process. Alternatively, the lumens can be formed by discrete processing steps, such as inserting a lumen tube through balloon <b>92</b> and then bonding or welding the lumen tube to the balloon, or shaft <b>90</b>, at appropriate locations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an embodiment in which shaft <b>92</b> is an over-the-wire shaft, it is preferably formed of a suitable polymer material. However, shaft <b>92</b> can also extend proximally to a stainless steel hypotube shaft (not shown) and be bonded to the stainless steel hypotube shaft at a desirable location. It may also be desirable to have a stainless steel extension, or support shaft <b>95</b>, extending from the hypotube shaft to a region proximate balloon <b>92</b>, to provide rigidity to enhance pushability of shaft <b>90</b> and balloon <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Shaft <b>90</b> also preferably includes an inflation lumen <b>93</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>), as well as guidewire sheath lumen <b>94</b>. Inflation lumen <b>93</b> has an opening <b>97</b> which communicates with the interior of balloon <b>92</b>. Lumen <b>93</b> extends proximally along shaft <b>90</b>, all the way to the proximal end of shaft <b>90</b> which resides outside the body during dilatation and/or stent deployment. Guidewire sheath lumen <b>94</b>, on the other hand, can extend all the way to the proximal end of shaft <b>90</b>, or can have a proximal ostium which is disposed just proximal of the proximal end <b>100</b> of balloon <b>92</b>, and also proximal of the proximal end <b>98</b> of slit <b>96</b> (described below)</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one preferred embodiment, shaft <b>90</b> includes slit <b>96</b> which has a proximal end <b>98</b>, disposed just proximal of proximal end <b>100</b> of balloon <b>92</b>, and a distal end <b>102</b> which is coterminous with the distal tip of balloon <b>92</b>. In one embodiment, slit <b>96</b> is simply a cut or separation made in the wall of shaft <b>90</b>. Preferably, the distal end of slit <b>96</b> has a v-cut lead in and the proximal end has a relief hole to inhibit tearing.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As will be described in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11I</figref>, single balloon <b>92</b> and device <b>86</b> can be used to dilate both branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> of bifurcation <b>10</b> by alternatively switching from following one guidewire <b>58</b>, to following the other guidewire <b>60</b>, without removal of device <b>86</b> from the vessel. Briefly, this is done by first advancing balloon <b>92</b> along guidewire <b>58</b>, while allowing guidewire <b>60</b> to slip through slit <b>96</b> as balloon <b>92</b> enters the first branch vessel <b>14</b>. Then, balloon <b>92</b> is withdrawn such that both guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are again within guidewire lumen <b>94</b>. Balloon <b>92</b> is then rotated and advanced along guidewire <b>60</b>, allowing guidewire <b>58</b> to exit guidewire lumen <b>94</b> through slit <b>96</b>. This allows balloon <b>92</b> to be advanced along guidewire <b>60</b> into the other branch vessel <b>16</b> for dilatation of that branch vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> illustrates a first step in dilating bifurcation <b>10</b> with device <b>86</b>. Guidewire <b>58</b> is first advanced to bifurcation <b>10</b>, and the lesion in branch vessel <b>14</b> is crossed with guidewire <b>58</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, guidewire sheath <b>88</b> is advanced over guidewire <b>58</b> such that its distal end is disposed just proximal of bifurcation <b>10</b>. Guidewire <b>60</b> is then advanced through sleeve <b>88</b> and across the lesion in branch vessel <b>16</b>. This is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It should be noted that sleeve <b>88</b>, can be backloaded or preloaded onto wires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>. In any case, sleeve <b>88</b> is preferably loaded within the distal end of lumen <b>94</b> of catheter <b>90</b>, and both guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are loaded into sleeve <b>88</b> in guidewire lumen <b>94</b> of shaft <b>90</b>. Once guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>, and sleeve <b>88</b>, are in the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, device <b>86</b> is advanced over guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>, and sleeve <b>88</b> (possibly with the assistance of a guide catheter&#x2014;not shown) until the distal tip <b>102</b> of slit <b>96</b> is closely proximate, or adjacent, the distal tip of sleeve <b>88</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>. It can be seen that the distal tip of sleeve <b>88</b> is positioned at a point where guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> diverge from one another into branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Device <b>86</b> is then rotated such that slit <b>96</b> engages wire <b>58</b>. Device <b>86</b> is then advanced distally while wires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are held longitudinally in place. This causes guidewire lumen <b>94</b> to track guidewire <b>60</b>, while allowing guidewire <b>58</b> to escape from guidewire lumen <b>94</b> along slit <b>96</b>. Thus, as device <b>86</b> is advanced distally, the distal end of device <b>86</b> follows guidewire <b>60</b> into branch vessel <b>16</b> of bifurcation <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Device <b>86</b> is further advanced along guidewire <b>60</b> to a position where balloon <b>92</b> is sufficiently disposed within branch vessel <b>16</b>. This is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Once balloon <b>92</b> is positioned within branch vessel <b>16</b>, balloon <b>92</b> is inflated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11F</figref>. This dilates branch vessel <b>16</b>. Of course, balloon <b>92</b> can be inflated and deflated any desired number of times, as is well known, in order to accomplish desired dilatation of branch vessel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Balloon <b>92</b> is then deflated and device <b>16</b> is withdrawn proximally such that the distal tip <b>102</b> of slit <b>96</b> is again closely proximate the distal tip of sleeve <b>88</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11G</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11G</figref> also illustrates that, once tip <b>102</b> is withdrawn just proximal of the distal tip of sleeve <b>88</b>, both guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> fully reside within guidewire lumen <b>94</b>, since sleeve <b>88</b> also resides coaxially within guidewire lumen <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In order to dilate the lesion in branch vessel <b>14</b>, device <b>86</b> is again rotated until slit <b>96</b> is in position to engage guidewire <b>60</b>. Device <b>86</b> is then advanced distally, while holding guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> longitudinally in place. This causes guidewire lumen <b>94</b> to track along guidewire <b>58</b>, while allowing guidewire <b>60</b> to escape through slit <b>96</b>. Device <b>86</b> is advanced further distally until balloon <b>92</b> resides sufficiently within branch vessel <b>14</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11H</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Balloon <b>92</b> is then inflated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11I</figref>, in order to dilate the branch vessel <b>14</b>. Of course, as described with respect to branch vessel <b>16</b>, balloon <b>92</b> can be inflated and deflated a desired number of times in order to accomplish sufficient dilatation. Balloon <b>92</b> is then deflated, and device <b>86</b> is withdrawn from the vasculature. Of course, device <b>86</b> can be withdrawn from the vasculature, along with guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>, in a single step.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As described in the background portion of the specification, dilatation of one of branching vessels <b>14</b> or <b>16</b> can cause the other of branching vessels <b>14</b> or <b>16</b> to collapse. This is undesirable for a number of reasons. For example, if the vessel is collapsed, or even restricted, blood flow through the vessel is undesirably obstructed. Further, if the vessel collapses, it does not provide support, or back pressure, to the branch vessel being dilated. This can result in inefficient dilatation of that branch vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12C</figref> illustrate a perfusion tube <b>106</b> in accordance with one aspect of the present invention. Perfusion tube <b>106</b>, in one preferred embodiment, is formed of a generally tubular structure <b>108</b> which is made of polyethylene, or another suitable polymer material. Tubular structure <b>108</b> is attached, such as by welding, adhesive, or another suitable bonding technique, to a push wire <b>110</b> which is made of stainless steel, or another suitable material. Tubular member <b>108</b> also includes a slit, or elongate aperture, <b>112</b> which extends from a proximal end <b>114</b> thereof to a distal end <b>116</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> is an end view of tubular member <b>108</b> and illustrates that slit <b>112</b> extends all the way through the tubular wall of member <b>108</b>. Tubular member <b>108</b> is preferably formed of a material with sufficient rigidity that the tubular member <b>108</b> will not roll up on itself about its longitudinal axis. Such rolling may be further inhibited by providing slit <b>112</b> at an angle relative to the longitudinal axis of tubular member <b>108</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Perfusion tube <b>106</b> can be used in much the same way as device <b>86</b> described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-11I</figref>. In other words, perfusion tube <b>106</b> can be used to selectively track one of guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> into one of branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, and then to track the other of guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> into the other branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, without removing profusion tube <b>106</b> from the vasculature.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref> illustrates that, in a preferred embodiment, after sheath <b>88</b> is advanced to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, perfusion tube <b>106</b> is advanced over sheath <b>88</b> and rotated such that slit <b>112</b> engages guidewire <b>58</b>. Profusion tube <b>106</b> is then advanced further distally, by pushing on push wire <b>110</b>, such that the lumen within profusion tube <b>106</b> tracks along guidewire <b>60</b> while guidewire <b>58</b> is allowed to escape through slit <b>112</b>. Of course, profusion tube <b>106</b> can be positioned to track guidewire <b>58</b> for placement within branch vessel <b>14</b>. In order to accomplish such placement, push wire <b>110</b> is pulled proximally such that profusion tube <b>106</b> is withdrawn back over sleeve <b>88</b> such that both guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are again within the lumen of tubular member <b>108</b>. Profusion tube <b>106</b> is then rotated such that slit <b>112</b> engages guidewire <b>60</b>, and profusion tube <b>106</b> is again advanced. This time, the lumen in profusion tube <b>106</b> tracks over guidewire <b>58</b> while allowing guidewire <b>60</b> to escape such that profusion tube <b>106</b> can be advanced into branch vessel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should also be noted that profusion tube <b>106</b> can easily be used with device <b>86</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one preferred embodiment, profusion tube <b>106</b> is loaded onto sleeve <b>88</b> distally of device <b>86</b>. Of course, profusion tube <b>106</b> could also be loaded onto sleeve <b>88</b> proximally of device <b>86</b>. However, for the sake of expedience, only the embodiment in which profusion tube <b>106</b> is loaded distally will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In any case, profusion tube <b>106</b> is preferably advanced over sleeve <b>88</b> until the distal end <b>116</b> of profusion tube <b>106</b> is closely proximate the distal end of sleeve <b>88</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Then, profusion tube <b>106</b> is rotated such that slit <b>112</b> engages wire <b>58</b>. Profusion tube <b>106</b> is then advanced such that it tracks guidewire <b>60</b> into branch vessel <b>16</b> while guidewire <b>58</b> is allowed to escape through slit <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Device <b>86</b> is then advanced distally until its distal end is closely proximate the distal end of sleeve <b>88</b>. As described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11I</figref>, device <b>86</b> is rotated to a position where slit <b>96</b> engages wire <b>60</b>. Device <b>86</b> is advanced distally such that guidewire lumen <b>94</b> tracks guidewire <b>58</b>, allowing guidewire <b>60</b> to escape through slit <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">By continuing to advance profusion tube <b>106</b> and device <b>86</b> as described above, profusion tube <b>106</b> will reside in branch vessel <b>16</b> while balloon <b>92</b> of device <b>86</b> will reside in branch vessel <b>14</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. Balloon <b>92</b> can then be inflated to accomplish dilatation of branch vessel <b>14</b> without collapsing branch vessel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Similarly, both devices can then be withdrawn proximally (while holding guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> and sleeve <b>88</b> in place) to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. Profusion tube <b>106</b> is then rotated such that slot <b>112</b> engages wire <b>60</b> and so that profusion tube <b>106</b> can be advanced within branch vessel <b>14</b>. Device <b>86</b> is positioned such that slit <b>96</b> engages guidewire <b>58</b> so balloon <b>92</b> can be advanced within branch vessel <b>16</b>. This is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>. Balloon <b>92</b> is then inflated to dilate branch vessel <b>16</b>. Since profusion tube <b>106</b> now resides in branch vessel <b>14</b>, dilatation can be accomplished without collapsing branch vessel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another preferred embodiment, profusion tube <b>106</b> can be used to accomplish dilatation as well. In that embodiment, tubular member <b>108</b> has a lumen therethrough which is sufficiently sized to receive balloon <b>92</b> in the deflated position. Both device <b>96</b> and profusion tube <b>106</b> are rotated such that slit <b>96</b> and slot <b>112</b> both engage the same guidewire (such as guidewire <b>60</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref>). Balloon <b>92</b> is placed within the lumen of profusion tube <b>106</b> in the deflated position, and both balloon <b>92</b> and profusion tube <b>106</b> are placed in the same branch vessel (such as branch vessel <b>14</b>). Balloon <b>92</b> is then inflated using perfusion tube <b>106</b> to exert outward pressure to dilate the chosen branch vessel. Of course, it should also be noted that a second profusion tube can also be used and inserted in the opposite branch vessel to prevent that branch vessel from collapsing during dilation.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a dilatation and stent deployment device <b>120</b> in accordance with another aspect of the present invention. Device <b>120</b> is illustrated as an over-the-wire catheter but could be implemented in a monorail construction as well. Device <b>120</b> includes a catheter shaft <b>122</b> and balloon <b>124</b>. Balloon <b>124</b> includes proximal end <b>126</b>, distal end <b>128</b> and intermediate portion <b>130</b>. Shaft <b>122</b> includes inflation lumen <b>132</b>, first guidewire lumen <b>134</b>, and second guidewire lumen <b>136</b>. In one preferred embodiment (although not the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14C</figref>), the inflation lumen <b>132</b> and first guidewire lumen <b>134</b> are coaxially aligned with guidewire lumen <b>134</b> disposed within inflation lumen <b>132</b>. Inflation lumen <b>132</b> is preferably in fluid communication with the interior of balloon <b>124</b> through aperture <b>138</b>. A proximal end of shaft <b>122</b> is thus couplable to a source of fluid pressure for delivering fluid under pressure to, and withdrawing fluid from, the interior of balloon <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">First guidewire lumen <b>134</b> is preferably configured as a conventional guidewire lumen which extends from the proximal end of catheter shaft <b>122</b> through the distal end of catheter shaft <b>122</b> (distal of balloon <b>124</b>). This allows catheter shaft <b>122</b> to be advanced over guidewire <b>58</b> or <b>60</b> in a conventional manner.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, second guidewire lumen <b>136</b> also extends from the proximal end of catheter shaft <b>122</b> to a distal region of catheter shaft <b>122</b>, but not all the way to the distal tip of shaft <b>122</b>. Rather, the distal opening of guidewire lumen <b>136</b> is disposed in intermediate region <b>130</b> of balloon <b>124</b>. Thus, guidewire <b>58</b> or <b>60</b> (guidewire <b>60</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>) exits the distal opening of guidewire lumen <b>136</b> at the intermediate portion <b>130</b> of balloon <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">It should also be noted that device <b>120</b> can be formed in a monorail structure in which the proximal opening of each of guidewire lumens <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> do not extend all the way to the proximal end of shaft <b>122</b>. In that embodiment, guidewire lumens <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> extend proximally only to a point proximal of the proximal end <b>126</b> of balloon <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> shows a greatly enlarged portion of second guidewire lumen <b>136</b> in region <b>140</b> of balloon <b>124</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> illustrates that, in one preferred embodiment, a coil <b>142</b> is disposed within second guidewire lumen <b>136</b>, at least in region <b>140</b> proximate balloon <b>124</b>. Coil <b>142</b> can be any suitable material, such as stainless steel, surlyn, polyester, or another suitable material.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a portion of device <b>120</b> taken along section lines <b>14</b>C-<b>14</b>C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, and illustrates one preferred method of forming balloon portion <b>124</b> of device <b>120</b>. A coextruded tube of balloon material is first provided with a pair of lumens therein. Interior pressure is then exerted on the portion of guidewire lumen <b>136</b> which extends through balloon <b>124</b>. This causes guidewire lumen <b>136</b> to expand. Coil <b>142</b> is then placed within the expanded lumen <b>136</b> and that region of the balloon material is heated to shrink the balloon material down over coil <b>142</b> and thereby frictionally secure coil <b>142</b> within lumen <b>136</b>. A hole <b>143</b> is then drilled in the side of the structural wall portion of balloon <b>124</b> in order to form the distal ostium of guidewire lumen <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, interior pressure is exerted on the interior of lumen <b>144</b> to expand lumen <b>144</b>, which becomes the interior of balloon <b>124</b>. Shaft <b>122</b> is then inserted through lumen <b>144</b> and the distal end <b>128</b> of balloon <b>124</b> is secured (such as with adhesive or through welding) to the distal end of shaft <b>122</b>. The proximal end <b>126</b> of balloon <b>124</b> is then also secured to shaft <b>122</b> such that the portion of lumen <b>136</b> through balloon <b>124</b> communicates with the portion of lumen <b>136</b> on shaft <b>122</b>. The remainder of the proximal shaft <b>126</b> of balloon <b>124</b> is then secured about the periphery of shaft <b>122</b> to form a fluid tight seal such that the interior <b>144</b> of balloon <b>124</b> can be inflated by providing pressurized fluid through inflation lumen <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Since coil <b>142</b> resides within lumen <b>136</b>, and since lumen <b>136</b> is eccentrically arranged relative to the longitudinal axis of balloon <b>124</b>, it has been observed that inflation of balloon <b>124</b> can cause balloon <b>124</b> to arc, or form a convex shape in a longitudinal direction, about coil <b>142</b> and lumen <b>136</b>. This is caused because the resistance to inflation on the side of balloon <b>124</b> containing coil <b>142</b> is greater than the resistance to inflation on the opposite side of balloon <b>124</b>. Therefore, in accordance with one preferred embodiment, an extra bead or portion of balloon material <b>146</b> is disposed during the extrusion process in the balloon wall on an opposite of coil <b>142</b>. This causes a balancing in resistance to the inflation force and thus reduces or eliminates any deformation of balloon <b>124</b> upon inflation.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref> illustrates operation of device <b>120</b>. Guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are first preferably advanced across lesion <b>18</b> and into branch vessels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Then, device <b>120</b> is either backloaded, or preloaded, onto guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> such that one of guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> is disposed within lumen <b>134</b> and the other is disposed within lumen <b>136</b>. In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>, guidewire <b>58</b> is disposed within lumen <b>134</b>, while guidewire <b>60</b> is disposed within lumen <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Device <b>120</b> is then advanced distally to bifurcation <b>10</b>. As device <b>120</b> is advanced distally, the distal end <b>128</b> of balloon <b>124</b> tracks along guidewire <b>58</b>, because guidewire lumen <b>134</b> extends out the distal end of shaft <b>122</b>. This causes the distal end <b>128</b> of balloon <b>124</b> to extend within branch vessel <b>14</b>. Balloon <b>124</b> is then inflated to dilate branch vessel <b>14</b>. It should also be noted, of course, that balloon <b>124</b> can be used to deploy a stent in branch vessel <b>14</b> as well, and that it can be advanced into smaller vessels as well.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref> illustrates stent <b>156</b> disposed on the distal end of balloon <b>124</b>. A stent such as stent portion <b>64</b> could also be disposed on balloon <b>124</b> with guidewire <b>60</b> extending out through aperture <b>68</b> in the wall structure of stent <b>64</b>. In any case, prior to loading guidewires <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> into device <b>120</b>, stent <b>156</b> is preferably crimped down over the distal portion of balloon <b>124</b> in a known manner. Balloon <b>124</b> is then loaded onto the guidewires and advanced to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>. Balloon <b>124</b> is then inflated to drive stent <b>156</b> to its expanded, deployed position in which it frictionally engages the inner wall of the lumen of branch vessel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In order to dilate, or deploy a stent in, branch vessel <b>16</b>, device <b>120</b> is withdrawn proximally and is reoriented such that guidewire <b>58</b> is disposed within lumen <b>136</b>, and guidewire <b>60</b> is disposed within lumen <b>134</b>. Device <b>120</b> is then advanced distally until the distal tip <b>128</b> of balloon <b>124</b> is disposed within branch vessel <b>16</b> (or in another distal vessel). Again, balloon <b>124</b> is inflated to either dilate branch vessel <b>16</b> or to deploy a stent therein.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref> illustrates, the proximal portion of balloon <b>124</b> will still reside in parent vessel <b>12</b> while the distal portion of balloon <b>124</b> is in either of the branch vessels <b>14</b> or <b>16</b>. Thus, inflation of balloon <b>124</b> can be used to cause simultaneous dilation of parent vessel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref> illustrate another method of forming lumen <b>136</b> in balloon <b>124</b>. Rather than providing a separate lumen within the balloon wall structure of balloon <b>124</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14E</figref>, a second balloon or cavity <b>160</b> is formed within balloon <b>124</b> which comprises the portion of guidewire lumen <b>136</b> within balloon <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Balloon <b>124</b> is first provided. Then, a portion of balloon material is placed within balloon <b>124</b>, and is inflated to form a second balloon, or cavity, <b>160</b> within balloon <b>124</b>. Balloon <b>160</b> is then attached, such as through adhesive, welding or another suitable process, to the interior side wall of balloon <b>124</b>. An aperture <b>126</b> is then drilled in the exterior wall of balloon <b>124</b> and into cavity <b>160</b>, to form the distal ostium of guidewire lumen <b>136</b>. In addition, the proximal end of balloon <b>160</b> is secured about the tube forming the proximal portion of guidewire lumen <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a dilatation or stent deployment device in which the distal end of guidewire lumen <b>136</b> is formed in a different manner. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, sheath <b>164</b> is disposed about the proximal, exterior surface of balloon <b>124</b>. Sheath <b>164</b> is secured to the exterior surface of balloon <b>124</b> throughout the entire exterior periphery of the proximal end of balloon <b>124</b> except at a region <b>166</b> which is in alignment with guidewire lumen <b>136</b>. In that region, sheath <b>164</b> is not attached to the exterior surface of balloon <b>124</b>. The space between the exterior surface of balloon <b>124</b> and the interior surface of sheath <b>164</b> in region <b>166</b> defines the distal region of guidewire lumen <b>136</b>. It should also be noted that a tube, or other suitable material, can be inserted between balloon <b>124</b> and sheath <b>164</b> in the area of lumen <b>166</b> in order to provide additional structural integrity to the lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a device <b>170</b> in accordance with one aspect of the present invention. Device <b>170</b> is similar to the device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. However, rather than forming a second balloon within the interior of balloon <b>124</b> in order to provide the distal region of guidewire lumen <b>136</b>, device <b>170</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> includes a second balloon <b>168</b> formed on the exterior of balloon <b>124</b>. Balloon <b>168</b> is coupled, by transition shaft <b>172</b>, to the proximal portion of guidewire lumen <b>136</b>. Balloon <b>168</b> is formed in a conventional manner, and is simply provided to define the distal region of the second guidewire lumen <b>136</b> such that it has a distal opening in the intermediate portion of balloon <b>124</b>. Balloon <b>168</b> could also be made longer such that its distal end resides in the branch vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a device <b>180</b> in accordance with the present invention. Device <b>180</b> is similar to device <b>170</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, and similar items are similarly numbered. However, rather than providing a second balloon <b>168</b> to provide the distal portion of guidewire lumen <b>136</b>, device <b>180</b> simply provides a tube <b>182</b> which is connected to guidewire lumen <b>136</b> in shaft <b>122</b>. Tube <b>182</b> is preferably a polyethylene tube which is a free floating tube in that it is not attached to the exterior surface of balloon <b>124</b>. Tube <b>182</b> has its distal tip defining the distal opening of guidewire lumen <b>136</b> in the intermediate region of balloon <b>124</b>. Tube <b>182</b> could also be made longer such that its distal opening resides in the branch vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Thus, it can be seen that the present invention provides significant advantages over prior systems for performing dilatation and stent deployment at bifurcations. The present invention provides a system for simultaneously tracking two guidewires which can be positioned in the branch vessels of the bifurcation, and maintained in those branch vessels throughout the entire dilation and stent deployment. In addition, the present invention provides a system with which dilation and stent deployment can be performed in both branch vessels, without collapsing either. This reduces the cumbersome nature of performing dilation and stent deployment at bifurcations, and also enhances the efficiency of dilation and stent deployment performed in those regions.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to methods of producing customized designs resembling appliqu&#xe9;s created with traditional needlework techniques, and more particularly to a method of creating a design that is melded onto an underlying border material for adhering to a final surface such as a garment.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention includes a method and apparatus for creating a design that is melded onto an underlying layer of material that is then cut out and applied onto a final surface to produce an appliqu&#xe9;. The design is first created by using a printer to print a design onto a top layer of &#x201c;puff&#x201d; or other suitable cloth material. The apparatus can adhere the top layer onto a bottom layer material, such as felt or other cloth backing material, using hot glue or other adhering means. The design on the top layer and/or the border created by the bottom layer material can be embellished with a line of printed or cut stitches. The printed design area is first cut out of the top layer material and then the bottom layer respectively, to create a two layer appliqu&#xe9; consisting of the design on the top layer with an underlying border of material on the bottom layer. The appliqu&#xe9; can be heat pressed onto a final surface such as a garment, and resembles an appliqu&#xe9; created and stitched with traditional or labor-intensive needlework techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a preferred embodiment, the printed material is fed from a printer into an automated apparatus that deposits hot glue laminate onto a bottom layer of felt or other cloth backing material on a conveyor belt and then uses a roller to press and meld the two layers together. A laser may be used to cut a particular printed design, including any hollow areas within the design, out of the top layer material. The laser may also burn a dotted line into the bottom layer, just outside the outer edge of the design area on the top layer, so that the design appears to be surrounded by a line of stitching on the bottom layer material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The two layer appliqu&#xe9;, consisting of a design on the top layer appearing as if stitched onto an underlying border created by the bottom layer, is then cut out of the waste portions of the bottom layer material using a laser. Next, hot glue laminate is applied to the bottom side of the appliqu&#xe9;, which is then heat pressed onto a final surface such as a garment that has been placed onto a platen on the conveyor belt of the apparatus. If &#x201c;puff&#x201d; material is used for the top layer, the heat and pressure applied to the appliqu&#xe9; causes the puff material to expand and provide a three-dimensional raised or puff effect. The printed appliqu&#xe9; as adhered onto the final surface resembles one created and stitched with traditional or labor-intensive needlework appliqu&#xe9; techniques.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The process of the present invention is particularly suited to creation of single or low unit batches of a design. Instead of creating a large number of design units that must be held in stock, this process enables on-demand printing to allow a customer to create a small number of units in a efficient manner without expending the time and labor required for traditional needlework appliqu&#xe9; techniques. A design is simply printed onto fabric, adhered to cloth backing, cut as desired, and attached to a garment or other product.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a layer of material such as heat activated puff material <b>12</b> fed from an automated printer that has printed a particular design <b>10</b> onto the material <b>12</b>. The design can be any shape and any printable color or mixture of colors. A lines of stitches can be printed just inside the outer border of the design, to give the appearance of hand-stitching as in an appliqu&#xe9;.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A particular design <b>10</b> is printed, using information submitted to the printer by a customized software application that places and processes orders, onto the top layer of puff or other cloth material <b>12</b>. A dotted line resembling stitches may be then printed onto the design, inside the outer edge of the particular printed design, giving the appearance that the puff or top layer design is attached to the bottom layer with hand or machine stitching. The design <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is simply a hollow rectangle. In practice, the printed design would generally be more intricate, possibly having a plurality of discrete and separate shapes such as symbols or letters in different fonts as well as a wide range of colors capable of being printed with the printer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The material is fed into the appliqu&#xe9; making apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. On the conveyor belt of the apparatus <b>13</b>, a bottom layer of felt or other cloth backing material <b>14</b> serves as the underlying layer and border of the appliqu&#xe9;, onto which the layer of &#x201c;puff&#x201d; or other cloth material <b>12</b> is melded. Suitable materials <b>12</b> include heat activated &#x201c;puff&#x201d; material that expands upon application of heat and pressure to give a three-dimensional raised or puff effect. It can, for example, be a heat activated appliqu&#xe9; on pressure sensitive release paper such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,458. Other suitable materials include any cloth backing material.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To form the appliqu&#xe9;, hot glue laminate <b>16</b> is deposited onto the bottom layer of material with a digital glue dispenser having an array of heads in the shape of the particular design shown in <b>10</b>. Then, a roller (not shown) melds the top layer of puff or other material <b>12</b> onto the underlying layer of felt or other cloth material <b>14</b> as shown in <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Next, the printed design <b>10</b>, including both the design's outer edges and any inner edges surrounding any hollow spaces <b>20</b> within the design, is cut out of the top layer material <b>12</b> using a laser that leaves the bottom layer <b>14</b> intact. Although at this point the top layer <b>12</b> has been melded onto the underlying bottom layer <b>14</b>, the laser is able to cut into only the top and not the bottom layer. If desired, the laser also burns a dotted line of holes <b>24</b> into the bottom layer outside the outer edges of the design, giving the appearance of a line of stitching on the border of the material underlying the top layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The two layer design is then cut out of the waste portions of the bottom layer material with a laser, such that the resulting appliqu&#xe9; consists of a printed design (i.e. top layer) melded onto an underlying felt or other material border (i.e. bottom layer). Scraps or waste material resulting from the cutting of the top layer <b>12</b> and/or the bottom layer <b>14</b> are removed by blowing compressed air onto the design area (or by other suitable extracting methods such as gravity or mechanical picking methods). The appliqu&#xe9; is then ready to be applied to a final surface using a heat press. The final surface may be a cloth substrate or garment or similar surfaces as found on another product such as a baseball cap, a jacket, a backpack, a pillow, a bag or other surfaces that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To heat press the printed appliqu&#xe9; onto a final surface, the final surface is placed onto a platen that is suitable for that final surface. The platen is then placed back onto the conveyor belt of the apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Finally, hot glue laminate is applied to the back side of the bottom layer of the appliqu&#xe9; and the appliqu&#xe9; is then heat pressed onto the final surface. If &#x201c;puff&#x201d; material is used for the top layer, the heat and pressure applied to the appliqu&#xe9; by the press causes the puff material to expand, giving the appliqu&#xe9; a three-dimensional raised or puff effect.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the two layer appliqu&#xe9; applied onto a T-shirt <b>100</b> as a final surface. The design <b>110</b> from a top layer of material shown with printed stitches <b>112</b> is applied with hollow area <b>120</b> shown underlying bottom layer <b>114</b>. Thus, bottom layer <b>114</b> shows through in hollow area <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A preferred embodiment includes first printing a particular design onto a top layer of &#x201c;puff&#x201d; or other material that is fed onto an appliqu&#xe9; making apparatus, then melding the top layer with hot glue onto an underlying layer of felt or other material, optionally printing a dotted line onto the design area inside its outer edges to resemble stitching, and cutting the printed design area to separate the design from the waste portions of top layer material. A dotted line may also be burned into the bottom layer, just outside the outer border of the design area on the top layer. Next, the two layer appliqu&#xe9;, including the top layer of puff or other material and the bottom layer of felt or other material melded together, is cut out of the waste portions of the bottom layer with a laser. Compressed air is blown onto the appliqu&#xe9; area to remove any scraps or waste material. To adhere the appliqu&#xe9; onto a final surface, the final surface is placed onto a platen on the conveyor belt of the apparatus. Glue laminate is applied to the bottom side of the appliqu&#xe9;. The appliqu&#xe9; is then heat pressed onto the final surface. If puff material is used for the top layer, the heat press will cause the puff layer to expand and provide a three-dimensional raised or puff effect.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention as described provides a method of creating appliqu&#xe9;s with an automated process that produces appliqu&#xe9;s that appear as if they were created with and adhered onto a final surface using traditional needlework appliqu&#xe9; techniques. The process is fast, inexpensive, and uniquely suited to the manufacture of smaller quantities of a particular appliqu&#xe9; design.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for purposes of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes in the methods and apparatus disclosed herein may be made without departing from the scope of the invention which is defined in the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a personal-care composition in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion comprising a first oil-soluble solid sunscreen, a second oil-soluble solid sunscreen, and a non-polar silicone oil.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The majority of highly effective sunscreens are oily or oil-soluble. These sunscreens are necessary for UV blocking, but have an unpleasant heavy, oily skin feel and present formulation difficulties such as sunscreen solubility and compatibility with other components. To counter the heavy, oily skin feel associated with sunscreen compositions, such products are commonly formulated as emulsions. The majority of such emulsions are oil-in-water emulsions wherein the aqueous phase (which in most cases is predominantly water) is thickened with polymeric thickeners. One problem with oil-in-water emulsions is that, being water-based, they too easily rinse or rub off of the skin, e.g., after perspiring, swimming, or washing hands. Considerably fewer sunscreen compositions in the form of an inverse emulsion (water-in-oil) exist. Inverse emulsions have a tendency to feel greasy and heavy. There is a desire to provide a sunscreen composition comprising a water-in-oil emulsion which has a pleasant skin feel and which does not rinse or rub off of the skin too easily. To accomplish this desire, silicone oil may be incorporated into the composition as the primary oil-phase component.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the incorporation of silicone oil into a sunscreen composition, however, other issues become critical, such as sunscreen solubility. Poor sunscreen solubility leads to the sunscreen precipitating out of the oil phase at certain concentrations or temperatures, resulting in crystals that the user can see and feel, as well as compositions with reduced or limited UV protection benefits. Generally, it is easier to solubilize liquid sunscreens in silicone oil than it is to solubilize solid sunscreens in silicone oil. For broad spectrum UV protection, it is typically necessary to use a combination of UV-A blocking sunscreens and UV-B blocking sunscreens. While effective UV-B blocking sunscreens are available in both liquid and solid form, almost all of the most effective UV-A blocking sunscreens currently approved for use are only available in solid form. A polar-oil solvent may be used to help solubilize solid UV-A blocking sunscreens, but as more solvent is added to a composition, the more greasy, heavy, and unpleasant the composition feels. There is a need to improve the solubility in silicone oil of solid UV-A blocking sunscreens without the addition of more solvent, so that even at high concentrations or temperatures the solid sunscreens do not separate out of the oil phase. Further, there is a need to provide a sunscreen composition with a pleasant skin feel and sufficient UV blocking.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The addition of more solid sunscreens to the oil phase of a water-in-oil emulsion would seem to make solubility even more difficult to achieve. But, surprisingly, it has been found that solubility is improved when more solid sunscreens are added to the oil phase. In fact, two types of solid sunscreens solubilize into the silicone oil better than one type of solid sunscreen alone. For example, in a composition comprising two solid sunscreens, oxybenzone and avobenzone, it has been found that when the amount of oxybenzone is increased, avobenzone tends to precipitate out of the silicone oil less frequently. As a result of these unexpected learnings, more oxybenzone may be used in a composition in place of a sunscreen solvent. This approach may provide higher UV-A efficacy, with better skin feel, and without crystallization issues.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, a personal-care composition is in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion, comprising at least about 10% of a non-polar silicone oil; from about 0.01% to about 10% of a first oil-soluble solid sunscreen; and from about 0.01% to about 10% a second oil-soluble solid sunscreen. In this embodiment, the weight ratio of the first oil-soluble solid sunscreen to the second oil-soluble solid sunscreen is from about 0.8 to about 2.0 and the first oil-soluble solid sunscreen is oxybenzone.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, a personal-care composition is in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion, comprising at least about 10% of a non-polar silicone oil; from about 0.1% to about 10% oxybenzone; and from about 0.1% to about 10% avobenzone. In this embodiment, the weight ratio of oxybenzone to avobenzone is from about 0.8 to about 2.0.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further embodiment, a personal-care composition is in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion, comprising at least about 10% of a non-polar silicone oil; from about 1% to about 6% oxybenzone; from about 1% to about 5% avobenzone; and a skin-care active selected from the group consisting of a vitamin B<sub>3 </sub>compound, a sugar amine, a peptide, a hexamidine compound, and combinations thereof. In this embodiment, the weight ratio of oxybenzone to avobenzone is from about 1.0 to about 1.5.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method for improving the solubility of a second oil-soluble solid sunscreen in the oil phase of a water-in oil emulsion, comprising the step of: combining a first oil-soluble sunscreen and a second oil-soluble sunscreen. In this embodiment, the weight ratio of the first oil-soluble solid sunscreen to the second oil-soluble solid sunscreen is from about 1.0 to about 1.5 and the first oil-soluble solid sunscreen is oxybenzone.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another embodiment, a personal-care composition comprises at least about 10% of a non-polar silicone oil; from about 0.01% to about 10% of a first oil-soluble solid sunscreen; and from about 0.01% to about 10% a second oil-soluble solid sunscreen.

In particular embodiments, the second oil-soluble solid sunscreen is a UV-A blocking sunscreen. An exemplary second oil-soluble solid sunscreen is avobenzone.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Surprisingly, it has been found that within a specified weight ratio of a first oil-soluble solid sunscreen to a second oil-soluble solid sunscreen, the addition of the first oil-soluble solid sunscreen improves the solubility of the second oil-soluble solid sunscreen. This is believed to run counter to what is known in the art of solubility&#x2014;adding more solid sunscreen would seem to worsen solubility. Indeed, if the weight ratio of the first oil-soluble solid sunscreen to the second oil-soluble solid sunscreen outside the specified weight ratio, the second oil-soluble solid sunscreen will precipitate out or crystallize. In certain embodiments, the weight ratio of the first oil-soluble solid sunscreen to the second oil-soluble solid sunscreen is from about 0.8 to about 2.0, or from about 1.0 to about 1.5, or from about 1.2 to about 1.4.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The present invention further relates to a method of improving the solubility of oil-soluble solid sunscreens in the oil phase of a water-in-oil emulsion. In one embodiment, the solubility of a second oil-soluble solid sunscreen in the oil phase of a water-in oil emulsion is improved by combining a first oil-soluble sunscreen and a second oil-soluble sunscreen, wherein the weight ratio of the first oil-soluble solid sunscreen to the second oil-soluble solid sunscreen is from about 1.0 to about 1.5. In a particular embodiment, the first oil-soluble solid sunscreen is oxybenzone and the second oil-soluble solid sunscreen is avobenzone.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The present invention further relates to methods of protecting keratinous tissue from the harmful effects of UV radiation by the application of any of the aforementioned personal-care compositions to keratinous tissue. Such methods generally involve attenuating or reducing the amount of UV radiation which reaches the keratinous tissue. In certain embodiments, the personal-care compositions described herein are suitable for use as a sunscreen to provide protection to keratinous tissue from the harmful effects of UV radiation such as sunburn, dry or damaged hair, and premature aging of the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a further aspect, the personal-care composition may be used to improve or regulate the condition of keratinous tissue. Conditions to be improved or regulated include increasing the luminosity or &#x201c;glow&#x201d; of the skin, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and coarse deep lines, fine lines, crevices, bumps, and large pores; thickening of keratinous tissue (e.g., building the epidermis and/or dermis and/or sub-dermal layers of the skin, and where applicable the keratinous layers of the nail and hair shaft, to reduce skin, hair, or nail atrophy); increasing the convolution of the dermal-epidermal border (also known as the rete ridges); preventing loss of skin or hair elasticity, for example, due to loss, damage and/or inactivation of functional skin elastin, resulting in such conditions as elastosis, sagging, loss of skin or hair recoil from deformation; reduction in cellulite; change in coloration to the skin, hair, or nails, for example, under-eye circles, blotchiness (e.g., uneven red coloration due to, for example, rosacea), sallowness, discoloration caused by telangiectasia or spider vessels, dryness, brittleness, and graying hair.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">III. Examples</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The following describe non-limiting examples of the personal-care composition. The reported percentages indicate the weight of the component expressed as a percentage of the total weight of the personal-care composition. Each Example may comprise one or more of the optional ingredients in amounts as disclosed herein. The Examples may be prepared as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a suitable vessel, combine the aqueous-phase ingredients and heat to 90&#xb0; C. with gentle mixing. In a separate vessel, combine the sunscreens (e.g., octisalate, homosalate, octocrylene, avobenzone, oxybenzone), polar oil (e.g., isopropyl lauroyl sarcosinate), and wax (e.g., Cirebelle 303, Accumelt 72, Accumelt 82, or Accumelt 90) and heat to 90&#xb0; C. with mixing. When both solutions are translucent and free of particulates to the naked eye, pour the hot water phase into the sunscreen mixture, then immediately add the remaining silicone phase ingredients to the same container. Stir vigorously until smooth and homogeneous while maintaining the temperature of the product above the wax melt point. Remove the product from the heat source and cool to 33&#xb0; C. with constant stirring. Scrape the sides of the container frequently to ensure the product is sheared homogeneously. Pour product into suitable containers.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Alternatively, the product can be prepared without shear during cooling. In this case, upon removal from the heat source, the hot emulsion is immediately poured into suitable containers and allowed to come to room temperature.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The following two solubility studies demonstrate the unexpected improvement in solubility from the claimed combinations of two oil-soluble solid sunscreens. For these solubility studies, the oil phase of a water-in-oil emulsion was created by combining ingredients in a suitable vessel, heating to 90&#xb0; C. with mixing, and then cooling to room temperature while mixing. The oil-phase composition for each study, shown in the table below, consists of a combination of the non-polar silicone oil, mineral oil, liquid-sunscreen actives, the oil-soluble solid sunscreen avobenzone, and varying levels of the polar oil isopropyl lauroyl sarcosinate and the oil-soluble solid sunscreen oxybenzone.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Once each of the oil phases in the above studies were at room temperature, they were filled into glass vials and stored at three different conditions: room temperature (RT; approximately 22&#xb0; C.), 5&#xb0; C., and &#x2212;7&#xb0; C. After about one month of storage, all vials were equilibrated at room temperature and then visually examined for any signs of crystallization or precipitation of the oil-soluble solid sunscreens.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The results of the two solubility studies are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, describing solubility Study A results (2% avobenzone), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, describing solubility Study B results (3% avobenzone). The x-axes, X, represent the % oxybenzone, i.e., from 0% to 5% oxybenzone. The y-axes, Y, represent the % isopropyl lauroyl sarcosinate, i.e., from 0% to 12% isopropyl lauroyl sarcosinate. The circle data plot means soluble under all test conditions (RT, 5&#xb0; C., and &#x2212;7&#xb0; C.). The square data plot means borderline soluble (one or a few crystals only at &#x2212;7&#xb0; C.). The triangle data plot means not soluble at one or more test conditions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show the unexpected improvement in avobenzone solubility when oxybenzone is added at oxybenzone to avobenzone ratios of between 0.8 and 2.0, with maximum solubility at a ratio between 1 and 1.5. On or above the dashed line, the avobenzone is fully solubilized. Below the dashed line, the avobenzone is borderline soluble or not soluble at all. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate that with no oxybenzone present, significant levels of the non-sunscreen polar oil isopropyl lauroyl sarcosinate are required to keep avobenzone soluble in the oil phase. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that with no oxybenzone present, greater than about 4% isopropyl lauroyl sarcosinate is required to keep avobenzone soluble in the oil phase; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that with no oxybenzone present, greater than about 10% isopropyl lauroyl sarcosinate is required to keep avobenzone soluble in the oil phase. However, as low levels of the oil-soluble solid sunscreen oxybenzone are added, less polar oil is required to keep the sunscreens soluble. Finally, as even higher levels of oxybenzone are added, solubility of the sunscreens then becomes poorer again. The figures demonstrate the unexpected solubility benefit within a specified weight ratio range of the first oil-soluble solid sunscreen, oxybenzone, to the second oil-soluble solid sunscreen, avobenzone. Surprisingly, the addition of more of the first oil-soluble solid sunscreen improves the solubility of the second oil-soluble solid sunscreen.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to an adhesive tape having superior ductility, strength, tear resistance and abrasion resistance, particularly a pressure sensitive adhesive. Polymeric pressure sensitive adhesive tapes are economical and adaptable to many different applications. One primary example is as floor marking in industrial and factory environments. However, there are several disadvantages to using such tape in industrial settings. One disadvantage is that the tape lacks sufficient strength and hardness to prevent wearing, tearing, cracking and breakage from heavy and repeated traffic, such as from forklift trucks. Similarly, as a result of poor adhesive quality, repeated traffic has a tendency to detach many commercially available tapes from the floor. Another disadvantage is that the aesthetic qualities and physical properties of the tape are diminished from scuffing, scratching, and the like. Such disadvantages plague existing polymeric pressure sensitive adhesive tapes. Because of these disadvantages that have been associated with polymeric pressure sensitive adhesive tape, wide industry acceptance has been historically difficult to achieve. Accordingly, many opt to rely on the time consuming and exacting practice of painting.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In view of the above discussion, it is an advantage of the present invention to provide a polymeric adhesive tape that has superior ductility, strength, tear resistance and abrasion resistance. Other advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to one embodiment, an adhesive tape is provided. The tape has a first layer of polymeric material having a Shore A Hardness of between 92 and 100 and a thickness of between 0.020&#x2033; and 0.065&#x2033;, and a second layer of adhesive. Preferably, the adhesive is of a pressure sensitive type.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The adhesive tape of this invention usually comprises a layer of polymeric material and at least one layer of adhesive material. The pressure-sensitive adhesive tape of this invention is not limited to having only the above layers of polymeric material and layer of pressure-sensitive adhesive material. It may optionally have an additional layer, such as a laminating substrate on an outermost side of the above adhesive layer. The laminating substrate is usually peeled off and thrown away when pressure-sensitive adhesive tape is actually used. Therefore, inexpensive materials are preferred, however, there are no particular limitations on the materials used for the laminating substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example of the pressure-sensitive adhesive tape of this invention wherein a layer of polymeric material (<b>1</b>) is attached to the top side of a layer of pressure-sensitive adhesive material (<b>2</b>) and a laminating substrate (<b>3</b>) is attached to the bottom side of the pressure-sensitive adhesive material. Upon removal of the laminating substrate (<b>3</b>), the tape can be applied to a floor (<b>4</b>) with the application of pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The pressure-sensitive adhesive tape of this invention can be produced in a variety of lengths, widths, and thickness. A variety of colors can also be used for the outer surface of the layer of polymeric material (<b>1</b>). For example, safety yellow can be used for aisle markings, or red can be used for quarantine and reject markings in a production facility. Coloring can be achieved by introducing a colorant in any form, including pigments and dyes into the polymeric material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The adhesive employed in layer material (<b>3</b>) may be any of those heretofore employed in the art for preparing adhesive structures. By way of illustration, suitable adhesives of this general description include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,559, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The layer of polymeric material (<b>1</b>) may be a durable polymer such as polyvinyl chloride, polycarbonate, or a terpolymer comprised of acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene or the like. A clear or tinted polyvinyl chloride is a preferred material. The polymer selected must have Shore A Hardness between, for example, 92-100, and preferably between 93-97. The outer surface of the layer of polymeric material (<b>1</b>) is preferably textured. The layer of polymeric material (<b>1</b>) may have a thickness of about, for example, 0.020&#x2033; to 0.065&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantageously, this embodiment of the invention provides improved tear resistance, strength, and abrasion resistance by employing the sum or all of the combination of polymer selected, Shore A Hardness, textured surface, and layer thickness.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One embodiment of the invention will be described below in greater detail through the following examples.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Test samples were performed on a 4&#x2033; wide sample of the pressure sensitive adhesive tape of this invention. The example tape was constructed of a semi-rigid 95A polyvinyl chloride from Artemis Industries, 2550 Gilcrest Rd, Akron Ohio 44305 which was extruded from a 2&#xbd;&#x2033; diameter NRM extrusion machine at 360-380&#xb0; F. at an extrusion rate of 400 ft per hour to yield a 0.065 thick, 4&#x2033; wide layer. A textured first surface of the extruded polymer layer was achieved by following the above process parameters. During extrusion a rubberized double sided carpet tape (Product #591B) from International Tape Co., P.O. Box 240, 6 Industrial Drive, Windham, N.H. 03087 was applied to a second side of the extruded polymer layer. A tape from Windmill Tapes of Great Britain (www.windmilltapes.com) was used for comparison purposes. Test samples were conditioned at 73&#xb1;3&#xb0; F. and 50&#xb1;5% relative humidity for at least 24 hours prior to testing.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Tensile strength at yield point was determined according to ASTM D 882 testing method. A 0.5&#x2033;&#xd7;8&#x2033; sample was prepared and placed in the jaws of the instrument at a separation of 4.0&#x2033;. The tester was started at a separation rate of 2.0 in/min. At the instance the tape yielded the force was recorded. Five replicates of each sample were conducted and the results were normalized to pounds per inch width. Results indicate higher yield point and higher absolute forces involved at yield point for the pressure sensitive adhesive tape of this invention. Particularly, the yield point in both machine and traverse direction were respectively, on average, 3,176 lb/in<sup>2 </sup>and 3,136 lb/in<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Tear resistance was determined according to the ASTM D 1004 test method. The samples were die cut according to the method. The liner from the sample was removed and the sample was placed in the jaws of the tester at a separation of one inch. The tester was started at a rate of 2.0 in/min. The maximum force encountered during testing was recorded. Five replicates of each sample in both the machine and traverse direction were tested. Results indicate substantially improved tear strength in both the machine and traverse directions for the pressure sensitive adhesive tape of this invention. Particularly, the tear strength in both machine and traverse direction was respectively, on average, 22.3 lb and 22.1 lb.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Caliper or thickness was determined according to the PSTC-33 method. Caliper of the material was determined both with and without the liner. Ten replicates of each sample were measured. Results indicate substantially increased thickness of the pressure sensitive adhesive tape of this invention, partly because of the inherent characteristics of the semi-rigid surface. Particularly, the thickness of the material, with and without the liner, was respectively, on average, 68.4 mil and 65.4 mil.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Peel adhesion was tested according to a modified PSTC-101D method. The modification included dwell time. Peel adhesion is a measure of the strength of the adhesive bond between the tape and the test surface. Exactly one (1.0) inch wide samples were applied to a standard stainless steel test panel at a rate of 24 in/min with a 4.5 pound rubber covered roller according to the method. The tape was then peeled from the substrate at a 90&#xb0; angle after a dwell time of one hour. The force required for removal was measured. Five replicates of each sample were tested. Results indicate substantially increased peel adhesion for the pressure sensitive adhesive tape of this invention when applied to stainless steel. Particularly, the peel adhesion of this material was, on average, 5.2 lb/in width.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Abrasion resistance was determined according to a modified ASTM D 5264 test method. The material was cut to a 2.5&#x2033;&#xd7;6&#x2033; size. A new 2&#x2033;&#xd7;4&#x2033; piece of standard A-5 receptor material (moderate abrasive) from Gavarti Associates Ltd. was affixed with double-sided tape to the four pound instrument weight (0.5 lb/in2 load). This in turn was placed over the test sample. The instrument was set for 100 strokes and operation was initiated. The instrument strikes an arc with the abrasive over the test material. Each stroke consists of one motion back and forth over the sample. When the cycles were completed the weighted abrasive was lifted and the test sample removed. At the conclusion of the test the overall quality of each sample was evaluated relatively for scratch resistance. Results indicate that the abrasion resistance of the pressure sensitive adhesive tape of this invention is improved over the comparative tape.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to bipolar devices and methods of making such structures. The present invention also relates to self-organizing devices, and more particularly to combinations of materials that can spontaneously form networks resulting in bipolar devices, and methods thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Rechargeable batteries enjoy an enormous and constantly growing global market due to their implementation in, for example, cellular telephone, laptop computers and other consumer electronic products. In addition, the development of electrically powered vehicles represents an immense potential market for these batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The lithium rechargeable battery is an attractive technology due to its comparatively high energy density, low potential for environmental and safety hazard, and relatively low associated materials and processing costs. The lithium battery is charged by applying a voltage between the battery's electrodes, which causes lithium ions and electrons to be withdrawn from lithium hosts at the battery's cathode. Lithium ions flow from the cathode to the battery's anode through an electrolyte to be reduced at the anode, the overall process requiring energy. Upon discharge, the reverse occurs; lithium ions and electrons are allowed to re-enter lithium hosts at the cathode while lithium is oxidized to lithium ions at the anode, an energetically favorable process that drives electrons through an external circuit, thereby supplying electrical power to a device to which the battery is connected.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently known cathode storage compounds such as LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>and LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>when used with currently known anodes such as lithium metal or carbon have working voltages between 3 and 4V. For many applications a high voltage and low weight are desirable for the cathode as this leads to high specific energy. For example, for electrical vehicle applications the energy-to-weight ratio of the battery determines the ultimate driving distance between recharging.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Cathodes in state-of-the-art rechargeable lithium batteries contain lithium ion host materials, electronically conductive particles to electronically connect the lithium ion hosts to a current collector (i.e., a battery terminal), a binder, and a lithium-conducting liquid electrolyte. The lithium ion host particles typically are particles of lithium intercalation compounds, and the electronically conductive particles are typically made of a substance such as a high surface area carbon black or graphite. The resulting cathode includes a mixture of particles of average size typically on the order of no more than about 10 to 30 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Anodes for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries typically contain a lithium host material such as graphite, electronically conductive particles to electronically connect the lithium ion hosts to a current collector (i.e., a battery terminal), a binder, and a lithium conducting liquid electrolyte. Alternatives to graphite or other carbons as the lithium ion host have been described by Idota et al., in <i>Science </i>1997, 276, 1395, and by Limthongkul et al., in &#x201c;Nanocomposite Li-Ion Battery Anodes Produced by the Partial Reduction of Mixed Oxides,&#x201d; <i>Chem. Mat. </i>2001.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In such cathodes or anodes, for reliable operation, good contact between particles should be maintained to ensure an electronically conductive pathway between lithium host particles and the external circuit, and a lithium-ion-conductive pathway between lithium host particles and the electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A solid polymer electrolyte is used as the ion conduction medium between the anode and cathode in some applications. A typical solid polymer electrolyte is composed of polymers having electron-donating atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus, together with a complex of lithium salt. Armand et al., in &#x201c;<i>Fast Ion Transport in Solids</i>&#x201d;, P. Vashishta, J. N. Mundy and G. K. Shenoy, Eds., North-Holland, Amsterdam (1979), p. 131, describe the use of poly(ethylene oxide) and other polyethers doped with various alkali metal salts as solid polymer electrolytes for battery applications. Subsequently, a great variety of ionically conductive solid polymer electrolytes based on a variety of lithium-ion complexing polymers have been reported (see, e.g., F. M. Gray, &#x201c;<i>Solid Polymer Electrolytes: Fundamentals and Technological Applications</i>&#x201d;, VCH, New York (1991)). More recently, detailed performance characteristics of an all-solid-state Li<sub>x</sub>MnO<sub>2</sub>/Li polymer battery system were reported by Sakai et al., in the <i>Journal of Electrochem. Soc. </i>149 (8), A967 (2002).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The ion conductivity of the solid polymer electrolyte is usually increased as the segmental motion of the polymer chain in increased. Therefore, the crystalline region within the polymer structure has to be minimized to increase the non-crystalline regions. Furthermore, linear or branched solid polymer electrolytes demonstrate poor mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of the polymer are shown to improve when the polymer chains are crosslinked.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one aspect of the invention, an electronic device is described. The device includes a first electrode in electrical communication with a first current collector, a second electrode in electrical communication with a second current collector, and a crosslinked solid polymer in contact with the first and second electrodes. At least one of the first and second electrodes is comprised of a network of electrically connected particles including an electroactive material, and the particles of at least one electrode exert a repelling force on the other electrode when the first and second electrodes are combined with an uncrosslinked precursor to the solid polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The electronic device is a device that has two conductive electrodes and a separating medium between the two electrodes. The separating medium can be ionically conducting or insulating. Examples of electronic devices include batteries, capacitors, diodes, and photovoltaics.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The electrochemical device can be a self-organized device, such as the self-organized battery system (SBS) described in co-pending application U.S. Ser. No. 10/206,662, which is incorporated herein by reference. A polymer electrolyte precursor is used in the assembly of the device, which is then crosslinked to form a solid polymer electrolyte. The crosslinked ionically conductive polymeric material can serve as the electrolyte as well as an in situ formed separator in the electrochemical device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect of the invention, a method for making an electronic device is provided. The method includes combining first particles, second particles and a liquid polymer precursor to a solid polymer, where the first and second particles are selected to exert a repelling force on each other when combined with the polymer precursor. At least a portion of the first particles are segregated into a first spatial region that is essentially free of the second particles to form a network of electrically-connected first particles to form a first electrode. At least a portion of the second particles are segregated into a second spatial region that is essentially free of the first particles to form a network of electrically-connected second particles to form the second electrode. The polymer precursor is in communication with both the first and second electrodes, and the polymer precursor is then crosslinked to form a solid polymer. The polymer can be insulating or ionically conducting.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another aspect of the invention, a method for making an electronic device is provided. The method includes applying a composition comprising first particles and a liquid polymer precursor to a solid polymer onto a first electrode surface. The first particles are selected to exert a repelling force against the first electrode surface when combined with the polymer precursor. At least a portion of the first particles are segregated into a first spatial region that is essentially isolated from the first electrode surface to form a second electrode, wherein the polymer precursor is in communication with both the first and second electrodes. The polymer precursor is then crosslinked to form a solid polymer. The polymer can be insulating or ionically conducting.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The precursor to the solid polymeric material is chosen such that the interaction between appropriate first and second electrodes, i.e., the anode and the cathode, is repulsive and the interaction between like particles (anode-anode or cathode-cathode interaction) is attractive, thereby providing electrical connection between like particles, while maintaining physical separation and thus electronic isolation between the anode and cathode materials. The polymer precursor has sufficiently low viscosity prior to crosslinking that the mixture of this liquid and the dispersed active particles is processable, i.e. can be tape cast, coated, extruded, etc. In addition, it is of a viscosity that permits self-organization of the first and second particles.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Selection of suitable polymer precursors is guided in part by the relationship between refractive index and London dispersion forces of the device components, namely that for materials <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> in medium <b>2</b>, a repulsive interaction is expected between materials <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> when the relative refractive indices, n, are such that n<sub>1</sub>&#x3c;n<sub>2</sub>&#x3c;n<sub>3 </sub>or n<sub>1</sub>&#x3e;n<sub>2</sub>&#x3e;n<sub>3</sub>. Thus, repulsion between anode and cathode is expected when the refractive index of the liquid polymer precursor is intermediate between those of the anode and cathode materials.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one or more embodiments, the ionic conductivity of the crosslinked solid polymer electrolyte is sufficient to provide the required performance in the electrochemical device, e.g., an SBS battery or other self-organized bipolar electrochemical device. In other embodiments, a liquid electrolyte or additive is combined with the solid polymer electrolyte to provide ionic conductivity at a level required for performance of the device as an SBS battery or other self-organized bipolar electrochemical device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In both cases the mechanical stability of the electrolyte layer is such that the cathode network does not come in contact with the anode network after many charge-discharge cycles. In both cases the electrochemical stability of the electrolyte layer is such that the impedance of the cell does not significantly increase after many charge-discharge cycles.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A lithium ion battery will be used to generally describe the various aspects of the present invention. The description of such a lithium ion bipolar device is meant to be exemplary and the use of the various features and aspects of the present invention to other systems is considered to be within the scope of the present invention. Self-organizing particulate structures can be used for energy storage or energy conversion systems including, but not limited to, primary (disposable) and secondary (rechargeable) batteries, capacitors, diodes, and hybrid electrochemical capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A conventional bipolar device is schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The bipolar device <b>10</b> can be an energy storage system having a cathode <b>14</b> and anode <b>12</b> that are spaced apart from each other by spacer region <b>22</b> containing an electrolyte <b>16</b>. A carbonaceous conducting additive and an electrolyte material are added to the energy storage material, e.g., lithium cobalt oxide, to improve the electronic and ionic conductivity, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The lithium battery can be charged by applying a voltage between the electrodes <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, which causes lithium ions and electrons to be withdrawn from lithium hosts at the battery's cathode. Lithium ions flow from cathode <b>14</b> to anode <b>12</b> through ionically conductive region <b>24</b> of the cathode and through the electrolyte <b>16</b> to be reduced at the anode. During discharge, the reverse occurs; lithium ions and electrons enter lithium hosts <b>20</b> at cathode <b>14</b> while lithium is oxidized to lithium ions at anode <b>12</b>, which is typically an energetically favorable process that drives electrons through an external circuit <b>18</b>, thereby supplying electrical power to a device to which the battery is connected. For improved operation, the electrode should provide fast transport for both electrons and lithium ions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The electrode structures described herein can be fabricated using self-organization. The selection of materials that exert attracting and repelling forces on one another produces self-organizing structures, specifically, self-organizing bipolar devices. A &#x201c;repelling&#x201d; or &#x201c;repulsive&#x201d; force is understood to mean a surface force that isolates the anode and cathode components from one another. The anode and cathode materials are isolated by an intervening or wetting layer of at least molecular dimensions (greater than about 1 nm) of the electrolyte. Surface forces can be used to self-organize a wide range of electrochemical devices described herein including, for example, batteries, capacitors, electrochromics, fuel cells, diodes and hybrid devices.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The principle for using surface forces in the organization of bipolar devices is first described. Van der Waals (vdW) forces between molecules and condensed phases are composed of at least three contributions, a Keesom force due to interactions between oriented permanent dipoles, a Debye force due to polarization induced in other molecules by a permanent dipole, and a London dispersion force due to polarization induced in other molecules by oscillations in the electron cloud of interatomic bonds. Of these, the London dispersion force is the most universal since it does not require the existence of permanent dipoles. In most systems, it is the dominant contribution to the vdW force. While dispersion forces can be relatively weak and long-range, their impact is not negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An important parameter scaling the dispersion force is the Hamaker constant A. For symmetric combinations of two materials, e.g., two plane-parallel surfaces of material <b>1</b> separated by a uniform thickness of material <b>2</b>, or vice versa, the Hamaker constant A<sub>121</sub>=A<sub>212 </sub>is always positive, leading to an attractive dispersion force (F<sub>vdW</sub>&#x3c;0). For asymmetric combinations, e.g., two plane-parallel surfaces of materials <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> separated by a uniform thickness of material <b>2</b>, the dispersion force can be either attractive or repelling. The repelling case arises where A<sub>123</sub>&#x3c;0 and F<sub>vdW</sub>&#x3e;0.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The magnitude of the dispersion force can be determined from careful measurements of surface forces such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) or from various approximations using physical properties of the materials involved. Recently, rigorous calculations of Hamaker constants using Lifshitz theory have become possible due to measurements of the spectral optical properties of materials over a very wide frequency range from the IR to deep UV. See, for example, &#x201c;Full Spectral Calculation of Non-Retarded Hamaker Constants for Ceramic Systems from Interband Transition Strengths,&#x201d; <i>Solid State Ionics, </i>75, 13-33 (1994) and <i>J. Am. Ceram. Soc., </i>83[9], 2117-46 (2000), which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For most materials and especially low refractive index materials (n&#x3c;2), the dominant interactions occur in the optical frequency range, and the Hamaker constant A<sub>123 </sub>can be approximated to good accuracy using optical index and static dielectric constant approximations, a widely used form of which is:</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The electronic frequency &#x3bd;<sub>e </sub>corresponds to the mean ionization frequency of the materials present, and is typically about 3&#xd7;10<sup>15 </sup>Hz. k is the Boltzmann's constant and h Plank's constant. The refractive indices in the visible range for mediums <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> are n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, and n<sub>3</sub>, respectively. E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>, E<sub>3 </sub>are the static relative dielectric constants. When the indices are ordered as n<sub>1</sub>&#x3e;n<sub>2</sub>&#x3e;n<sub>3 </sub>or n<sub>1</sub>&#x3c;n<sub>2</sub>&#x3c;n<sub>3</sub>, A<sub>123 </sub>is negative. Thus, the sign and magnitude of the Hamaker constant can be readily estimated from optical and dielectric data, while more precise quantification, where necessary, is possible with full-spectral methods. See, U.S. Ser. No. 10/206,662 for further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a self-organizing battery system, a first electrode material, a second electrolyte material and a third electrode material are selected in combination such that the first electrode material exerts self-attractive forces, the third electrode material exerts self-attractive forces, while the first and third electrode materials exert a mutually repelling force when they are separated by the electrolyte or its precursor. The relative forces of the system are generally predicted using the refractive indices of the component materials. In some instances other more precise techniques for determining surface forces may be used. For example, atomic force microscopy may be used to determine surface forces.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This principle is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, where two dissimilar materials, material <b>1</b> (<b>20</b>) and material <b>3</b> (<b>22</b>) are separated by a medium <b>2</b> (<b>24</b>). The vdW interaction can be rendered repelling through the judicious selection of materials (characterized by a negative Hamaker constant A<sub>123</sub>) (<b>25</b>). The vdW interaction between particles of like material separated by any other medium is typically attractive. Therefore, particles <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> experience a vdW attraction (<b>26</b>, <b>28</b>) to particles of their own kind. At a sufficiently high volume fraction of such particles and in the absence of unwanted coulombic or steric repulsion, percolative contact between like particles can occur. If the particles are individually electronically conductive, a continuous electronically conducting network results. Thus in battery systems, where the volume fraction of each storage compound should be maximized for maximum energy density, a percolative network of materials <b>1</b> and <b>3</b> can form naturally from the minimum volume of material, whereby material <b>1</b> is separated from material <b>3</b> by material <b>2</b>. The anode and cathode materials also each make contact to their respective current collectors (<b>29</b>, <b>30</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The resultant system is a self-organizing, co-continuous, interpenetrating microstructure in which an electrode is continuously &#x201c;wired&#x201d; to a current collector and another electrode to another current collector, while the repelling dispersion force is used to ensure electronic isolation of the two phases from one another. Exemplary devices include writable microbatteries, spin-on flat batteries, printable thick-film batteries and bulk storage batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A continuum of structures can be created from an initially homogeneous mixture of materials <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>. If (i) the mixture is cured over relatively long periods of time, (ii) the solids loading is relatively low, (iii) the viscosity of material <b>2</b> is relatively low, or (iv) the density contrast is relatively high, then the magnitude of segregation on the length scale of the thickness of the device can be high, thereby providing highly segregated branched structures well suited for use as electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When used as a battery, the separating medium is an electrolyte, and the electrolyte is ion conducting, but electronically insulating. During processing and self-organization of the device, the electrolyte is of low viscosity so that electrode materials are free to self-organize.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In co-pending application U.S. Ser. No. 10/206,662, polymer electrolytes or binders are dissolved in solvents to achieve the necessary viscosity for self-organization. In addition, the net index of the solvent plus polymer is intermediate between anode and cathode. Alternatively, a solid polymer electrolyte with refractive index intermediate between the anode and cathode is melt-processed. The solvent based requires removal of the solvent after assembly, giving rise to issues associated with drying time/energy costs, solvent retrieval/disposal or recycling. The potentially significant volume changes and drying stresses upon loss of the solvent can lead to electrical shorts between anode and cathode. Alternatively, in melt processing of a solid polymer electrolyte there is typically a tradeoff between limiting the amount of crystallinity (to maximize ionic conductivity) while maintaining high temperature structural stability, particularly when the electrolyte is also serving as a structural member (as is the case in the current invention.) The use of high molecular weight polymers improves the elevated temperature stability (elevated temperature being between 40 and 80&#xb0; C.), but at the expense of ease of processability due to high melt viscosities.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In many applications, it is desired that the electrolyte be a solid polymer electrolyte. The solid polymer electrolyte acts as a microscale separator having sufficient ionic conductivity for the operation of the device. However, typical solid polymer electrolytes, even transformed into a melt at elevated temperatures, are of too high a viscosity for effective self-organization of the component electrode particles.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It has been discovered that a liquid polymer, oligomer, or monomer electrolyte precursor to a solid polymer electrolyte or binder can be used in the manufacture of an electrochemical device using self-organization of the device components. The use of a low molecular weight precursor provides low viscosity prior to crosslinking as well as good elevated temperature structural stability in the final self-organized battery structure, which is bound and electrically isolated by the in-situ crosslinked polymer electrolyte matrix. In one or more embodiments, the polymer electrolyte precursor is a liquid at room temperature. In one or more embodiments, the precursor has a viscosity of less than about 10<sup>5 </sup>cP, or of less than about 10<sup>3 </sup>cP, or even of less than about 10<sup>2 </sup>cP before crosslinking.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The polymer electrolyte precursor is combined with particles to be used in the organization of an electrically connective network to form an electrode. The solids content of the resultant slurry or dispersion is sufficient to provide a percolative pathway of like particles, e.g., 10-80 wt % solids content. The viscosity of the slurry or dispersion provides a processable mixture, i.e., it can be cast, coated or extruded or deposited onto a surface. The composition has a viscosity of less than about 10<sup>6 </sup>cP, or of less than about 10<sup>5 </sup>cP, or even of less than about 10<sup>3 </sup>cP. A solvent may be added to the polymer electrolyte precursor to improve processibility, by for example lowering the viscosity of the slurry, improving the repulsive characteristics, i.e., altering the refractive index, or enhancing the solubility of a salt. Once crosslinked, the crosslinked solid polymer electrolyte has an ionic conductivity sufficient for the device to function as an electrochemical cell. In some embodiments, swelling of the crosslinked solid polymer electrolyte with a liquid electrolyte to increase ionic conductivity is contemplated, but not required.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A method of preparing an electrochemical device is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In practice, a salt (Li salt for a Li-ion battery system) and, if necessary, an appropriate initiator are dissolved in the polymer electrolyte precursor <b>302</b>. The appropriate anode materials <b>301</b> and cathode materials <b>303</b> are dispersed in the crosslinkable liquid polymer electrolyte precursor <b>302</b>, and cast from applicator <b>304</b> as a film <b>305</b> onto at least one current collector <b>306</b> selected or prepared such that the current collector <b>306</b> experiences an attractive interaction with the cathode materials <b>301</b> and a repulsive interaction with the anode materials <b>303</b>. A second current collector (not shown) may be applied to the upper surface, which experiences a repulsive interaction with the cathode and an attractive interaction with the anode. Sufficient time is given to allow self organization to take place, i.e. electrical connection via particle motion of the cathode particles to each other and the cathode current collector, and of the anode particles to each other and the anode current collector, as well as separation (and thus electrical isolation) between the anode and cathode particles. Concurrent with or after self-organization, crosslinking of the polymer electrolyte precursor is carried out, e.g. by (but not limited to) thermal or radiation-induced crosslinking.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An alternative electrochemical device and a method of its preparation are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A salt and, if necessary, an appropriate initiator are dissolved in the polymer electrolyte precursor <b>402</b>. An active material <b>404</b>, e.g., a cathode, is deposited on a current collector <b>406</b> as a film or other structure. The appropriate active material <b>408</b>, e.g., anode materials are dispersed in the crosslinkable liquid polymer electrolyte precursor <b>402</b>, and cast onto the active material structure <b>404</b>. The current collector <b>406</b> is selected or prepared such that the current collector <b>406</b> experiences an attractive interaction with the cathode materials <b>404</b> and a repulsive interaction with the anode materials <b>408</b>. A second current collector <b>410</b> may be applied to the upper surface, which experiences a repulsive interaction with the cathode and an attractive interaction with the anode.

Concurrent with or after self-organization, crosslinking of the polymer electrolyte precursor is carried out, e.g. by (but not limited to) thermal or radiation-induced crosslinking.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one or more embodiments, a polymer electrolyte precursor is used in a sequentially fabricated SBS battery. In this case, a first network of an active material is fabricated, and then a slurry comprised of the second active material and the liquid polymer precursor is introduced to the first network. If the first network is a foam, then the slurry can be infiltrated into the foam. If the first network is a coating, then the slurry can be coated on top of the coating.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A suitable polymer electrolyte precursor is a liquid at processing temperatures and is capable of crosslinking to form a solid polymer, in that a cubic centimeter of solid polymer does not flow under its own weight under time scales on the order of many days. In some embodiments in which a solid polymer electrolyte is produced via crosslinking, an ionic conductivity suitable for its intended use as an electrochemical cell is achieved by doping a salt into the precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Exemplary polymer precursors include functionalized polyethers, e.g., polyethers based on poly(oxy methylene), poly(ethylene oxide), poly(propylene oxide) and their copolymers or terpolymers having crosslinkable groups, which may be terminal or distributed along the polymer chain. Useful materials for solid polymer electrolyte precursors are the acrylate and methacrylate esters of polyethers. When the monoester is chosen, it is preferable to have the other (hydroxyl) terminus of the polyether precursor capped with, for example, a methyl group. It has been found that acrylate and methacrylate esters of low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol)s fulfill the requirements laid out above, namely having sufficient ionic conductivity and providing electrical isolation between the cathode and anode materials, as well as exhibiting low viscosity prior to crosslinking. For example, a highly loaded (50 vol. %) spheroidal carbon slurry in di-acrylate or di-methacrylate-poly(ethylene glycol) forms a carbon particle network that is electrically isolated from a low refractive index, conductive substrate selected to be repulsive to the carbon particles.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Representative examples of polymer electrolyte precursors include, without limitation, poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate, poly(propylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate, and poly(ethylene glycol) phenyl ether acrylate, poly(ethyleneglycol)dimethacrylate (or diacrylate), poly(methyleneglycol) dimethacrylate (or diacrylate), poly(propyleneoxide)dimethacrylate (or diacrylate), and mixtures of any of the preceding compounds. Other representative polymer electrolyte precursors include vinyl-terminated polyethers that are reactive with silane compounds (i.e., compounds containing Si&#x2014;H bonds) via hydrosilation reactions; and hydroxy terminated or hydroxy substituted polyethers that are reactive with isocyanates, blocked isocyanates, polyphenolics, melamine or melamine formaldehyde condensates, dicarboxylic acid compounds (or their derivatives) and diesters.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The solid polymer electrolyte precursors can also be crosslinked by means such as e-beam, X-ray, UV, and ionizing radiation, as is known in the polymer crosslinking art. Other means for crosslinking polyether precursors will be obvious to those skilled in the art, and are intended to be included herein.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The crosslinking agent is employed such that the final, crosslinked, solid polymer electrolyte has a range of molecular weights between crosslinks of about 30-10<sup>6 </sup>g/mol, or about 30-10<sup>4 </sup>g/mol, or about 30-10<sup>2 </sup>g/mol, Exemplary crosslinking agents include agents that decompose to form free-radicals, or that contain two or more carboxylic acids, or diisocyanates, melamines, phenolics, and melamine formaldehyde condensates, and the like. Crosslinking agents known in the art may be used in the practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The crosslinking agent is employed at an equivalent weight of about 30-10<sup>6 </sup>g/mol, or about 30-10<sup>4 </sup>g/mol, or about 30-10<sup>3 </sup>g/mol, where an equivalent weight is defined as the molecular weight of polymer between crosslinks. Exemplary crosslinking agents include agents containing two or more carboxylic acids, isocyanates, melanines, phenolics, and melanine formaldehyde condensates, and the like. Crosslinking agents known in the art may be used in the practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The crosslinking is initiated upon application of energy, such as heat, visible or UV energy, or x-ray, e-beam or gamma ray. A thermal or photo curing initiator can be added, depending on whether the polymer is to be crosslinked by photoreaction or thermally induced crosslinking or other energy source. Exemplary thermal initiators include, without limitation, azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN). Exemplary photoinitiators include, without limitation, H-Nu&#x2122; 635 and H-Nu&#x2122; 470 from Spectra Group, Cyracure&#x2122; products from Union Carbide, Sarcure&#x2122; products from Sartomer, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A lithium salt (or other salt) can be added to the electrolyte as is the practice in the art. The lithium salt can be added in the amount of about 3 to about 30 wt % or higher based on the weight of the polymer electrolyte. Representative lithium salts include LiClO<sub>4</sub>, LiCF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, LiBF<sub>4</sub>, LiPF<sub>6</sub>, LiAsF<sub>6</sub>, and Li(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N, as well as other lithium or other salts used in conventional polymer electrolytes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The prevailing focus of solid polymer battery research has been to increase the conductivity of the solid polymer electrolyte material. Although the electrochemical device described herein can benefit from the use of higher conductivity electrolyte, it is not required. Because the ionic conductance of the electrolyte determines transport rates, by decreasing the characteristic lithium ion diffusion length by a factor of &#x3e;10, or by a factor of 100, as is possible using self-organizing particulate structures, the resulting devices can provide power densities at least equivalent to that of current laminated designs using liquid electrolytes, while using available solid polymer electrolytes. Thus, the smaller dimensions of the device components reduce the ionic conductivity demands of the device. The ionic conductivity is in the range of about 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>S/cm to about 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>S/cm; however, electrolytes having ionic conductivities of less than 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>S/cm at room temperature may be used. In some embodiments, electrolytes having ionic conductivities of less than 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>S/cm at room temperature may be used. An organic liquid electrolyte can be infiltrated into the crosslinked solid polymer electrolyte to provide or enhance lithium conductivity. Other additives can be infiltrated into the crosslinked solid polymer electrolyte to provide or enhance passivation of the electrolyte/active material interface as is known by those skilled in the art. The permeability of the polymer is sufficient to provide absorption of a liquid electrolyte or additive to enable required performance in an SBS battery or other self-organized bipolar electrochemical device.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The conductive compounds used as lithium storage materials (primarily transition metal oxides, carbon, or metal alloys) tend to have higher refractive indices and dielectric constants than organic compounds useful as the electrolyte. Thus, some otherwise desirable combinations of cathodes and anodes cannot achieve a negative A<sub>123 </sub>using the intrinsic materials properties. A coating can be applied to any of the cathode materials or anode materials so that the combination results in appropriate repelling forces. That is, a coating can be applied to any of the cathode materials to provide a negative A<sub>123</sub>. This is most typically achieved by altering the refractive index of the particle by selecting a coating having a suitable index value. In one or more embodiments, the coating is electronically and ionically conductive.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The electrode can be a lithium intercalating material. Representative electrode materials for use as the cathode include compounds based on LiCoO2, LiCoO2 doped with Mg, LiNiO2, LiMn2O4, LiMnO2, LiMnO2 doped with Al, LiFePO4, LiMnPO4, Lix V6O13, Li2Fe2(SO4)3, V2O5, V6O11. Representative electrode materials for use as the anode include compounds based on carbon, amorphous carbon, graphite, mesocarbon microbeads, Li, LiAl, Li9Al4, Li3Al, Zn, LiZn, Ag, LiAg, Li10Ag3, B, Li5B4, Li7B6, Ge, Si, Li12Si7, Li21Si8, Li13Si4, Li21Si5, Sn, Li5Sn2, Li13Sn5, Li7Sn2, Li22Sn5, Sb, Li2Sb, Li3Sb, Bi, LiBi, Li3Bi, SnO2, SnO, MnO, Mn2O3, MnO2, Mn3O4, CoO, NiO, FeO, LiFe2O4, TiO2, LiTi2O4, and glass with a Sn&#x2014;B&#x2014;P&#x2014;O compound.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The coating can be a polymer or polymer blend/mixture/solid solution, an inorganic glassy or crystalline compound, or a blend or admixture or composite or solid-solution of the two. The coating can also provide electronic or ionic conductivity. By way of example, the coating can be a conductive polymer or polymer blend that has dielectric and optical properties providing a negative A123. Polyaniline, polypyrrole, and their derivatives can be a constituent of such blends as a conductive constituent. As another example, the coating can contain a poly(o-methoxyaniline) or poly(3-octylthiophene) as a conductive constituent, and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) or poly(vinylidene fluoride) as an A123 modifying constituent, or blends thereof. As another example, the coating can be a glassy or crystalline oxide, or solid-solution or blend of oxides, that provide electronic and ionic conductivity while also providing a negative A123. According to the invention, methods such as sol-gel synthesis, or encapsulation from solutions and suspensions of such materials, are used to provide coatings. Vanadium oxides VxOy containing multivalent vanadium, and mixtures of vanadium oxide with low refractive index oxides such as boron oxide B2O3, silicon oxide, SiO or SiO2, or phosphorus pentoxide P2O5, are included amongst such coating materials. See, copending application U.S. Ser. No. 10/354,405, filed on Jan. 30, 2003, and entitled &#x201c;Electrode and Related Devices&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Coating the storage particle permits a much wider range of storage materials to be used without being restricted to only those that have the dielectric and refractive index properties to provide A<sub>123</sub>&#x3c;0.

In those embodiments where the current collector is coated to provide an attractive surface for one of the materials <b>1</b> or <b>3</b> (but not the other), suitable coatings include an electronically conductive material having the appropriate refractive index.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Applying the selection criteria described above, numerous combinations of materials <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> can be selected, and such combinations can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The benefits of this invention include lower manufacturing cost, since less or no solvent is needed in the assembly process and potentially less residual stress is imparted to the device. The volume change during curing is less than that during drying/solvent extraction of a pure solvent-solution-based process. Use of such electrolytes leads to safer, longer lasting cells because of the absence of volatile and flammable liquid electrolytes, which can leak and often react with the highly reducing and oxidizing electrode materials. Furthermore, such batteries offer a greater shape flexibility, as they may not require heavy and expensive metal can packaging.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The following example are provided to illustrate the invention, which is not intended to be limiting of the invention, the scope of which is set forth in the claims which follow.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Preparation of a Self-Organizing Battery Using a Crosslinked Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate Solid Polymer Electrolyte</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PEG-DMA, molecular weight <b>770</b>) was used as the crosslinkable polymer electrolyte precursor, into which 10 wt. % LiN(SO<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>salt was dissolved to instill Li ion conductivity, and 1 wt. % AIBN based on functional methacrylate was dissolved to act as initiator for the thermally induced crosslinking reaction. A mixing was conducted under glovebox conditions (Argon, &#x3c;1 ppm O<sub>2</sub>, &#x3c;1 ppm H<sub>2</sub>O.) Glassy carbon beads (sieved to 20 to 45 &#x3bc;m) were dispersed in the polymer/salt/initiator solution in the volume ratio 1:1 glassy carbon:PEG-DMA via mechanical stirring. A thin layer <b>500</b> of carbon/polymer/salt/initiator slurry was then cast onto a thin (5-10 &#x3bc;m) low refractive index conductive composite polymer film <b>502</b> on a substrate <b>510</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The conductive polymer film included a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) latex acting as the low refractive index matrix material and 6.5 wt. % Baytron&#x2122; PH available from Bayer AG (a complex of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) with polystyrenesulfonate in latex form) for providing electrical conductivity. This film formulation is designed to give high electrical conductivity (about 3 S/cm) while maintaining a bulk refractive index in the composite film that is less than that of the polymer electrolyte precursor system. Electrical connection to the carbon-polymer dispersion was made via a Cu mesh current collector <b>504</b> which was electrically isolated from the underlying conductive polymer composite film and to which glassy carbon experienced an attractive interaction in the crosslinkable polymer electrolyte. This assembly was left undisturbed for 20 minutes under glovebox conditions to allow the percolating network of carbon particles to form within the polymer electrolyte precursor system as well as to allow the particles near the surface of the conductive polymer composite substrate film <b>502</b> to separate from the film via repulsive van der Waals forces. The system was then placed in a 100&#xb0; C. oven in a glovebox to crosslink for at least 20 minutes, after which the assembly is allowed to cool and electrical measurements are made. Table 1 illustrates the high resistance observed between the conductive film <b>502</b> and the current collector <b>504</b> using this chemistry in two separate experiments each containing 5 samples. Of ten samples total, 4 exhibited a resistance between the conductive carbon/crosslinked polymer electrolyte composite and the underlying conductive film of &#x3e;1 M&#x3a9;, 5 had resistance between 100 k&#x3a9; and 1 M&#x3a9;, and only one exhibited a resistance less than 100 k&#x3a9;. High resistance across the electrochemical junction is an indication of electrical isolation between the two films. Moreover, the electrical conductivity of the anode particle network within crosslinked polymer was on the order of 1&#x3a9;. Low resistance within the carbon particle network indicates a high power density can be achieved for the battery. The composite of the crosslinked solid polymer electrolyte with the glassy carbon had sufficient strength/mechanical integrity to be handled freely after testing.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">The family of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases (PARP) includes approximately 18 proteins, which all display a certain level of homology in their catalytic domain but differ in their cellular functions (Ame et al., <i>BioEssays., </i>26 (8), 882-893 (2004)). PARP-1 and PARP-2 are unique members of the family, in that their catalytic activities are stimulated by the occurrence of DNA strand breaks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">PARP has been implicated in the signaling of DNA damage through its ability to recognize and rapidly bind to DNA single or double strand breaks (D'Amours, et al., <i>Biochem. J., </i>342, 249-268 (1999)). It participates in a variety of DNA-related functions including gene amplification, cell division, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA base excision repair as well as effects on telomere length and chromosome stability (d'Adda di Fagagna, et al., <i>Nature Gen., </i>23 (1), 76-80 (1999)).</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0014">PARP has an essential role in facilitating DNA repair, controlling RNA transcription, mediating cell death, and regulating immune response. PARP inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in numerous models of disease particularly in models of ischemia reperfusion injury, inflammatory disease, degenerative diseases, protection from above adverse effects of cytotoxic compounds, and potentiation of cytotoxic cancer therapy. They are efficacious in the prevention of ischemia reperfusion injury in models of myocardial infarction, stoke, other neural trauma, organ transplantation, as well as reperfusion of the eye, kidney, gut and skeletal muscle. Inhibitors are efficacious in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, gout, inflammatory bowel disease, CNS inflammation such as MS and allergic encephalitis, sepsis, septic shock, hemorrhagic shock, pulmonary fibrosis, and uveitis. PARP inhibitors also show benefit in several models of degenerative disease including diabetes and Parkinsons disease. PARP inhibitors ameliorate the liver toxicity following acetaminophen overdose, cardiac and kidney toxicities from doxorubicin and platinum based antineoplastic agents, as well as skin damage secondary to sulfur mustards. In various cancer models, PARP inhibitors are shown to potentiate radiation and chemotherapy by increasing apoptosis of cancer cells, limiting tumor growth, decreasing metastasis, and prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing animals.</p>

<p id="p-0157" num="0337">Described herein are compounds, methods of making such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and medicaments that include such compounds, and methods of using such compounds to treat or prevent diseases or conditions associated with PARP activity.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0338">Described herein are compounds having activity in inhibiting the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). In some embodiments, the compounds have the structure set forth in Formula (I) or Formula (II).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0339">The mammalian enzyme PARP-1 is a multidomain protein. PARP-1 is implicated in the signaling of DNA damage through its ability to recognize and rapidly bind to DNA single or double strand breaks. D'Amours, et al., <i>Biochem. J., </i>342, 249-268 (1999); and Virag et al. <i>Pharmacological Reviews</i>, vol. 54, no. 3, 375-429 (2002) are hereby incorporated by reference for such disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0340">The family of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases includes approximately 18 proteins, which all display a certain level of homology in their catalytic domain but differ in their cellular functions. PARP-1 and PARP-2 are unique members of the family, in that their catalytic activities are stimulated by the occurrence of DNA strand breaks. Ame et al., <i>BioEssays, </i>26 (8), 882-893 (2004) is hereby incorporated by reference for such disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0341">PARP-1 participates in a variety of DNA-related functions including gene amplification, cell division, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA base excision repair as well as effects on telomere length and chromosome stability. d'Adda di Fagagna, et al., <i>Nature Gen., </i>23 (1), 76-80 (1999) is hereby incorporated by reference for such disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0342">Studies on the mechanism by which PARP-1 modulates DNA repair and other processes identifies its importance in the formation of poly(ADP-ribose) chains within the cellular nucleus. The DNA-bound, activated PARP-1 utilizes NAD+ to synthesize poly(ADP-ribose) on a variety of nuclear target proteins, including topoisomerases, histones and PARP itself. Althaus, F. R. and Richter, C., ADP-Ribosylation of Proteins: Enzymology and Biological Significance, Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1987); and Rhun, et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., </i>245, 1-10 (1998) are hereby incorporated by reference for such disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0343">Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is also associated with malignant transformation. For example, PARP-1 activity is higher in the isolated nuclei of SV40-transformed fibroblasts, while both leukemic cells and colon cancer cells show higher enzyme activity than the equivalent normal leukocytes and colon mucosa. Furthermore, malignant prostate tumors have increased levels of active PARP as compared to benign prostate cells, which is associated with higher levels of genetic instability. Miwa, et al., <i>Arch. Biochem. Biophys., </i>181, 313-321 (1977); Burzio, et al., <i>Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., </i>149, 933-938 (1975); Hirai, et al., <i>Cancer Res., </i>43, 3441-3446 (1983); and Mcnealy, et al., <i>Anticancer Res., </i>23, 1473-1478 (2003) are hereby incorporated by reference for such disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0344">In cells treated with alkylating agents, the inhibition of PARP leads to a marked increase in DNA-strand breakage and cell killing. PARP-1 inhibitors also enhance the effects of radiation response by suppressing the repair of potentially lethal damage. PARP inhibitors are also effective in radio-sensitizing hypoxic tumor cells. In certain tumor cell lines, chemical inhibition of PARP activity is also associated with marked sensitization to very low doses of radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0345">Furthermore, PARP-1 knockout (PARP &#x2212;/&#x2212;) animals exhibit genomic instability in response to alkylating agents and &#x3b3;-irradiation. Data indicates that PARP-1 and PARP-2 possess both overlapping and non-redundant functions in the maintenance of genomic stability, making them both interesting targets. Wang, et al., <i>Genes Dev., </i>9, 509-520 (1995); Menissier de Murcia, et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>94, 7303-7307 (1997); and Menissier de Murcia, et al., <i>EMBO. J., </i>22 (9), 2255-2263 (2003) are hereby incorporated by reference for such disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0346">There is also a role for PARP-1 in certain vascular diseases, such as, for example, septic shock, ischaemic injury and neurotoxicity. Oxygen radical DNA damage that leads to strand breaks in DNA, which are subsequently recognized by PARP-1, is a major contributing factor to such disease states as shown by PARP-1 inhibitor studies. PARP also plays a role in the pathogenesis of haemorrhagic shock. Cantoni, et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta, </i>1014, 1-7 (1989); Szabo, et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest., </i>100, 723-735 (1997); Cosi, et al., <i>J. Neurosci. Res., </i>39, 3846 (1994); Said, et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., </i>93, 4688-4692 (1996); and Liaudet, et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., </i>97(3), 10203-10208 (2000) are hereby incorporated by reference for such disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0347">Furthermore, efficient retroviral infection of mammalian cells is blocked by the inhibition of PARP-1 activity. Such inhibition of recombinant retroviral vector infections occurs in various different cell types. In some embodiments, inhibitors of PARP-1 are used in anti-viral therapies and in cancer treatment. Gaken, et al., i J. Virology, 70 (6), 3992-4000 (1996) is hereby incorporated by reference for such disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0348">Moreover, in certain embodiments, PARP-1 inhibition delays the onset of aging characteristics in human fibroblasts. While not intending to bound by any theory, this may be related to the role that PARP plays in controlling telomere function. Rattan and Clark, <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., </i>201 (2), 665-672 (1994); and d'Adda di Fagagna, et al., <i>Nature Gen., </i>23 (1), 76-80 (1999) are hereby incorporated by reference for such disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0349">In some embodiments, PARP inhibitors are relevant to the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

<p id="p-0273" num="0453">In general, carbon electrophiles are susceptible to attack by complementary nucleophiles, including carbon nucleophiles, wherein an attacking nucleophile brings an electron pair to the carbon electrophile in order to form a new bond between the nucleophile and the carbon electrophile.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0454">Suitable carbon nucleophiles include, but are not limited to alkyl, alkenyl, aryl and alkynyl Grignard, organolithium, organozinc, alkyl-, alkenyl, aryl- and alkynyl-tin reagents (organostannanes), alkyl-, alkenyl-, aryl- and alkynyl-borane reagents (organoboranes and organoboronates); these carbon nucleophiles have the advantage of being kinetically stable in water or polar organic solvents. Other carbon nucleophiles include phosphorus ylids, enol and enolate reagents; these carbon nucleophiles have the advantage of being relatively easy to generate from precursors. Carbon nucleophiles, when used in conjunction with carbon electrophiles, engender new carbon-carbon bonds between the carbon nucleophile and carbon electrophile.</p>

<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Use of Protecting Groups</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0456">The term &#x201c;protecting group&#x201d; refers to chemical moieties that block some or all reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. In specific embodiments, more than one protecting group is utilized. In more specific embodiments, each protective group is removable by a different process. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. In various embodiments, protective groups are removed by acid, base, or hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and are, in some embodiments, used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. In some embodiments, carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked with base labile groups such as, without limitation, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0457">In certain embodiments, carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while, in some embodiments, amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids are blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. In various embodiments, carboxylic acid reactive moieties are protected by conversion to simple ester derivatives as exemplified herein, or they are blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while, in some embodiments, co-existing amino groups are blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0458">In certain instances, allyl blocking groups are useful in the presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable. In some embodiments, such groups are subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, in some embodiments, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid is deprotected with a Pd<sup>0</sup>-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. In some embodiments, a protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate is attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0459">In some embodiments, blocking/protecting groups are selected from, by way of non-limiting example:</p>

Cells were added with 50 &#x3bc;l medium alone, medium containing 1 &#x3bc;M PARP inhibitor, medium containing increasing concentration of Temozolomide (0-1000 &#x3bc;M), and medium containing 1 &#x3bc;M PARP inhibitor and increasing concentration of Temozolomide (0-1000 &#x3bc;M). Final concentration range for Temozolomide was 0-1000 &#x3bc;M where applicable, final concentration of PARP inhibitor was 1 &#x3bc;M where applicable. Final concentration of DMSO was 1% in each well. Cells were allowed to grow for 5 days before cell survival was determined by CellTiter Glo staining (Promega, Madison, Wis., USA). Cell growth, determined after subtraction of time 0 values, was expressed as a percentage of the control well that contained medium with 1% DMSO. GI50 (concentration of drug that inhibited growth by 50%) values were calculated from the computer generated curves (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego Calif.). The potentiation factor [PF50 (potentiation factor at GI50)] was calculated as GI50 of Temozolomide alone/GI50 of Temozolomide+PARP inhibitor. Reference: Thomas H. D. et al. (2007).

Treatments are initiated when tumors are of measurable size (approximate leg diameter of 11 mm). Animals receive either a compound of Formula (I) (two doses of 25 or 50 mg/kg in saline) or saline (10 mg/ml) intraperitoneally administered daily on days 1-28, and are monitored on a daily basis during treatment (tumor measurements, body weights and clinical evidence are recorded); and as required after the last treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0569">The in vitro assays disclosed herein, along with other in vitro assays (Farmer et al, <i>Nature </i>2005; 434:913-7: clonogenic survival assay finding that a BRCA2-deficient cell line V-C8, compared with the BRCA2 wild type control exhibited sensitivity to AG14361, a PARP-1 inhibitor, (Ki=5 nm) and NU1025, a moderately potent PARP-1 inhibitor (Ki=50 nM); &#x26; Mcabe et al., Cancer Biology &#x26; Therapy 2005; 4:9, 934-36; clonogenic survival assay using CAPAN-1 cells maintained in DMEM supplemented with FCS (20% v/v), glutamine and antibiotics showing sensitivity to PARP inhibition using KU0058684) demonstrate the activity of PARP-inhibitors in a static test situation. Additionally, animal models have been used to analyze the relationship between in vitro tests and parameters of in vivo efficacy. By way of example only, Farmer et al., has shown in vivo efficacy in blocking the growth of BRCA2-deficient tumors using KU0058684, a PARP-1 inhibitor. Nature 2005; 434:913-7. This indicates that PARP-1 inhibition is a viable cancer treatment for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Furthermore, KU0059436, a PARP-1 inhibitor is currently in Phase I clinical trials for patients with advanced solid tumors. Given this information, compounds of Formula (I) which have shown in vitro inhibitory action are likely to show analogous in vivo (mouse and human) efficacy.</p>

<p id="p-0396" num="0623">Study Design: This is a dose-escalation study followed by an open label multicenter study. Patients will be stratified according to tumor type (breast vs ovarian) and mutation status (BRCA 1 vs BRCA 2). Patients will receive a compound of Formula (I) or (II) (at one of several possible dosages) over 30 minutes once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stable or responding disease may receive additional courses of treatment at the discretion of the chief investigator or Drug Development Office (DDO). Patients will undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. Samples will be analyzed for tumor marker (CA 125 or CA 15.3) measurements, plasma levels of a compound of Formula (I) or (II) via liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, PARP activity, and PARP protein expression via western blotting immunoassays. Paraffin embedded sections from original diagnostic biopsy are also collected and analyzed for PARP protein expression via immunohistochemical technique. Pleural and ascitic fluid may be collected and analyzed for DNA DS break repair proficiency via immunohistochemical technique. Some patients will also undergo biopsy of tumors and samples will be analyzed for BRCA 2 mutation as well as PARP activity via validated PARP immunoblotting assay. After completion of the study treatment, patients will be followed for 28 days.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Polyethylene terephthalate (also referred to as &#x201c;PET&#x201d;) is a polyester of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol and can be obtained by the polycondensation of dimethyl terephthalate with ethylene glycol, and also terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol. PET exists both as an amorphous (transparent) and as a semi-crystalline (opaque and white) thermoplastic material. Generally, it has useful chemical resistance to mineral oils, solvents and acids but not to bases. Semi-crystalline PET has good strength, ductility, stiffness and hardness. Amorphous PET has better ductility but less stiffness and hardness. PET is used to make bottles for soft drinks and other household, consumer and industrial products.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unfortunately, despite recycling efforts, billions of pounds of PET are still dumped into landfills annually all over the world. Other PET that is not reused is incinerated. The substantial amount of PET that is disposed into landfills creates significant waste. The incineration of PET wastes significant resources that could be used more effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thermoplastic molding compositions based on polybutylene terephthalate (also referred to as &#x201c;PBT&#x201d;) and fillers are used in various applications. Although conventional PBT-filler molding compositions are useful to many customers, conventional PBT-filler molding compositions generally cannot be made from recycle sources of PBT due to the lack of availability of PBT recycle streams. PET, unlike PBT, is made in much larger quantities and is partially recovered from consumer wastes. If PET (scrap) materials could be converted to PBT and converted into useful molding compositions, then there would exist a valuable way to meet the unmet need to effectively use underutilized scrap PET in PBT thermoplastic molding compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,611 teaches a process for converting waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) to either poly(ethylene-co-butylene terephthalate) or poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) by reaction with 1,4-butanediol. In discussing the prior art, U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,611 indicates that in most of the processes it cites, the undesirable byproduct diethylene glycol is formed which contaminates the final product and has to be removed by purification before the recovered products can be reused again. A principal object of U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,611 was to provide a process for converting poly(ethylene terephthalate) waste directly to another high value polymer without breaking down the poly(ethylene terephthalate) to its constituent monomers or oligomers. The patent discloses numerous examples in which a variety of polymers have a diol incorporated at various amounts. Example 11 shows a PBT polymer being formed with a complete replacement of ethylene glycol with 1,4-butanediol.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 teaches a process for making &#x201c;PBT&#x201d; from PET by reacting PET with 1,4-butanediol. A principal object of U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 was to produce PBT containing less than 1.0 wt. % units of ethylene glycol from PET scrap. Another principal objective of U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 was to develop a process that facilitates the reduction of THF generated in the process as much as possible to the extent that this PBT is economically competitive with PBT obtained from monomers. U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 emphasizes the production of PBT having ethylene glycol groups in an amount that is less than 1 wt. %. U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 discloses that &#x201c;[a]ny diethylene glycol units in the starting PET are also eliminated as completely as possible&#x201d; (Col. 3, ll 37-38). The patent discloses &#x201c;adding only enough 1,4BD [1,4-butanediol] to the PET as is necessary to yield a mixture that can be processed well at the reaction temperature.&#x201d; The patent discloses that, depending on the PET used &#x201c;up to 1.0 mol 1,4-BD per mol PET&#x201d; can be used. In the instances where compositions contain more than 1 wt. % ethylene glycol, U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 presents these compositions in comparative examples. Such compositions are described as having &#x201c;yellowish&#x201d; and &#x201c;slightly yellowish&#x201d; colors, respectively. It is not clear what standard is used in U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 to determine the weight percent reported, as the weight percent can reasonably be defined in as follows: (i) a divalent ethylene radical remaining after removal of hydroxyl groups from ethylene glycol, or (ii) a divalent radical remaining after removal of terminal hydrogen atoms from ethylene glycol. Each moeity has different molecular weight and, as such, each moiety can produce a different value.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese laid-open application 2005-89572 teaches a method for producing polybutylene terephthalate by transesterifying bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate with 1,4-butanediol in the presence of a transesterification reaction catalyst under the pressure of 1-54 kPa at a final temperature ranging from 200-230&#xb0; C. and then subjecting the reaction product to polycondensation. In one embodiment, the bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate is obtained by depolymerizing polyethylene terephthalate with excessive ethylene glycol, and purifying the depolymerized product. The patent teaches that transesterifying bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate with 1,4-butanediol under reduced pressure imparts favorable results.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Unfortunately, such documents do not meet the long felt need of improved use of PET scrap that is ordinarily incinerated or buried in landfills. U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,611, for instance, does not teach effective processes that enable PET to be able to be broken down into its constituent monomers or oligomers&#x2014;a feature that is sometimes required by commercial considerations. U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,611 does not provide meaningful guidelines for making compositions functionally similar to PBT containing ethylene glycol in amounts other than trace amounts and which exhibit melting temperatures that are higher than those shown in its examples. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 does not provide meaningful details about how to make effective PBT materials with ethylene glycol in amounts more than 1.0 wt. % or with other residues that can be found in some PET scrap. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 does not disclose to relatively more versatile processes that can use excess 1,4-butanediol, relative to the PET scrap used or that do not require that the diethylene glycol be &#x201c;eliminated as completely as possible.&#x201d; Known technology relating to utilizing PET as scrap materials for making PBT-like materials, in other words, does not provide meaningful solutions that solve the long felt need of new processes for better utilizing PET scrap that is ordinarily incinerated or buried in landfills.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For the foregoing reasons, there is a need to develop improved processes that utilize PET.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For the foregoing reasons, there is a need to develop new processes for making PBT random copolymers having useful performance properties.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention is based on the discovery that it is now possible to make a material that is derived from scrap polyethylene terephthalate that performs similarly to &#x201c;virgin PBT&#x201d; (PBT that is derived from monomers) in a novel and effective process. Unlike conventional methods for making virgin PBT, the PBT component made by the invention contains, in addition to other materials, ethylene glycol and isophthalic acid groups (components that are not present in virgin PBT). Despite producing a PBT that is structurally different from PBT used in known compositions, e.g., thermoplastic molding compositions, the PBT component of the invention exhibits similar performance properties as a molding composition containing virgin PBT. The compositions can also contain diethylene glycol groups.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For the sake of clarity, the terms terephthalic acid group, isophthalic acid group, butanediol group, ethylene glycol group in formulas have the following meanings. The term &#x201c;terephthalic acid group&#x201d; (R&#x2032;) in a composition refers to a divalent 1,4-benzene radical (-1,4-(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)&#x2014;) remaining after removal of the carboxylic groups from terephthalic acid. The term &#x201c;isophthalic acid group&#x201d; (R&#x2033;) refers to a divalent 1,3-benzene radical (-(-1,3-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)&#x2014;) remaining after removal of the carboxylic groups from isophthalic acid. The &#x201c;butanediol group&#x201d; (D) refers to a divalent butylene radical (&#x2014;(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)&#x2014;) remaining after removal of hydroxyl groups from 1,4-butanediol. The term &#x201c;ethylene glycol group&#x201d; (D&#x2032;) refers to a divalent ethylene radical (&#x2014;(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)&#x2014;) remaining after removal of hydroxyl groups from ethylene glycol. With respect to the terms &#x201c;terephthalic acid group,&#x201d; &#x201c;isophthalic acid group,&#x201d; &#x201c;ethylene glycol group,&#x201d; &#x201c;butanediol group,&#x201d; and &#x201c;diethylene glycol group&#x201d; being used in other contexts, e.g., to indicate the weight % of the group in a composition, the term &#x201c;isophthalic acid group(s)&#x201d; means the group having the formula (&#x2014;O(CO)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(CO)&#x2014;), the term &#x201c;terephthalic acid group(s)&#x201d; means the group having the formula (&#x2014;O(CO)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(CO)&#x2014;), the term diethylene glycol group means the group having (&#x2014;O(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)O(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)&#x2014;), the term &#x201c;butanediol group(s)&#x201d; means the group having the formula (&#x2014;O(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)&#x2014;), and the term &#x201c;ethylene glycol groups(s)&#x201d; means the group having formula (&#x2014;O(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)&#x2014;).</p>

In one embodiment, the modified polybutylene terephthalate component can further be derived from a biomass-derived 1,4-butanediol, e.g. corn derived 1,4-butanediol or a 1,4-butanediol derived from a cellulosic material.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term &#x201c;biomass&#x201d; means living or dead biological matter that can be directly or subsequently converted to useful chemical substances that are ordinarily derived from non-renewable hydrocarbon sources. Biomass can include cellulosic materials, grains, starches derived from grains, fatty acids, plant based oils, as well as derivatives from these biomass examples. Examples of useful chemical substances include and are not limited to diols; diacids; monomers used to make diols or acids, e.g., succinic acid; monomers used to make polymers; and the like. Biomass based 1,4-butanediol can be obtained from several sources. For instance, the following process can be used to obtain biomass-based 1,4-butanediol. Agriculture based biomass, such as corn, can be converted into succinic acid by a fermentation process that also consumes carbon dioxide. Such succinic acid is commercially available from several sources such as from Diversified Natural Products Inc. under the trade name &#x201c;BioAmber&#x2122;&#x201d;. This succinic acid can be easily converted into 1,4-butanediol by processes described in several published documents such as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,096,156, incorporated herein in its entirety. Bio-mass derived-1,4-butanediol can also be converted to tetrahydrofuran, and further converted to polytetrahydrofuran, also known as polybutylene oxide glycol. Another process that describes converting succinic acid into 1,4-butanediol is described in Life Cycles Engineering Guidelines, by Smith et al., as described in EPA publication EPA/600/R-1/101 (2001).</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The PET component from which the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer is made can be in any form that can be used according to our invention. Generally, the PET component includes recycle (scrap) PET in flake, powder/chip, film, or pellet form.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The process for making the PET-derived modified PBT may contain an additional step in which the PBT formed from the molten mixture is subjected to solid-state polymerization. Solid-state polymerization generally involves subjecting the PBT formed from the molten mixture to an inert atmosphere and heating to a temperature for a sufficient period of time to build the molecular weight of the PBT. Generally, the temperature to which the PBT is heated is below the melting point of the PBT, e.g., from 5 to 60&#xb0; C. below the melting point of the PBT. In one embodiment, such a temperature may range from 150 to 210&#xb0; C. Suitable periods of time during which the solid-state polymerization occurs may range from 2 to 20 hours, depending on the conditions and equipment. The solid-state polymerization is generally carried out under tumultuous conditions sufficient to promote further polymerization of the PBT to a suitable molecular weight. Such tumultuous conditions may be created by subjecting the PBT to tumbling, the pumping of inert gas into the system to promote fluidization of polymer particle, e.g., pellets, chips, flakes, powder, and the like. The solid-state polymerization can be carried out at atmospheric pressure and/or under reduced pressure, e.g. from 1 atmosphere to 1 mbar.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Remarkably, despite having residues derived from polyethylene terephthalate, e.g., ethylene glycol and isophthalic acid groups (groups that have long been regarded as undesired components in virgin PBT), the PET-derived modified PBT component exhibits useful properties.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The invention provides previously unavailable advantages. For instance, the invention provides a process that is relatively simple and effective at producing relatively large amounts of PET-derived modified polyesters, such as modified PBT efficiently. The process of the invention requires specific conditions found to be critical for avoiding disadvantages of processes disclosed in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, the process for making the PET-derived random, modified PBT copolymers can advantageously substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions and solid waste. Since the PET-derived polyester random modified PBT copolymers made by the inventive process are made from scrap PET and not monomers, the process significantly reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emissions and solid waste. Carbon waste reduction (or crude oil savings) occurs because the carbon that constitutes the dimethyl terephthalate or terephthalic acid ordinarily used to make polyesters is not used. Instead, rather a PET component, e.g., polyester scrap, is used. The process to make DMT or TPA from crude oil is highly energy intensive and as a result, substantial emissions of CO<sub>2 </sub>to the atmosphere occur from burning of non-renewable energy sources. By not using DMT or TPA to make the PET derived PBT, carbon dioxide emissions savings are obtained. In one embodiment, the process for making PET-derived modified PBT can eliminate at least 1 kg of CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions for every kilogram of PET-derived modified PBT made with the process, as compared to a process that makes virgin PBT homopolymers from monomers. In another embodiment, the process for making PET-derived modified PBT can eliminate from 1 kg to 1.5 kg, or more CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions for every kilogram of PET-derived modified PBT made with the inventive process, as compared to a process that makes virgin PBT homopolymers from monomers. Additionally, there are energy savings/reduced carbon dioxide emissions when the ethylene glycol byproduct is recovered and used instead of ordinary ethylene glycol in manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Additionally, when the source of BDO is a biomass derived feedstock such as succinic acid, the carbon dioxide savings are further increased for two reasons. Bio derived succinic acid is made form sugars or other bio derived hydrocarbons that are derived from atmospheric carbon vs fossil fuel carbon sources. This reduces the environmental impact of the polymer derived from BDO based on succinic acid from biomass sources. Furthermore, the fermentation to yield succinic acid requires carbon dioxide as an input thus leading to further carbon dioxide reductions.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Advantageously, a modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer can have a reduced CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions index. The reduced CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions index, as defined in this application, is the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>, expressed in kg, that is saved when one (1) kg of a composition containing the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymers is made, as compared to the amount of CO<sub>2 </sub>expressed in kg, that is created when the composition is made with polybutylene terephthalate that is derived from monomers. Generally, the modified PBT random copolymers have a reduced CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions index that is more than approximately 1.3 kg, and can range from 1.3 kg to 2.5 kg.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The basis for this feature is discussed below. The difference between the amount of CO<sub>2 </sub>that is created during ordinary processes for making virgin, monomer-derived PBT and the process for making 1 kg of the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymers can range from 1.3 kg to 2.5 kg, or more suitably from 1.7 kg to 2.2 kg. It should be noted that this difference is based on calculations for the entire process that starts from crude oil to the monomers to the PBT versus scrap PET to oligomers to the modified PBT. In other words, the process for making 1 kg of the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymers creates 1.3 to 2.5 kilograms less CO<sub>2 </sub>as compared to the process for making 1 kg of virgin PBT from crude oil.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">These results can be derived and verified by using material and energy balance calculations (calculations that are well known in the chemical engineering art) and comparing the amount of energy used to make modified PBT random copolymers from PET and the amount of energy used to make PBT from terephthalic acid or dimethyl terephthalate.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Green colored PET scrap from bottles was obtained from a commercial source. In the scrap cleaning process, the PET scrap was cleaned manually involving first a hot water wash followed by manual sorting to separate colored bottles and PVC bottles, crushing, hydrofloatation to separate PP, labels, caps etc., alkali wash to remove glue, and finally a demineralized water wash to remove alkali followed by drying. The resulting PET flakes were used as the main raw material in the depolymerization step. The post consumer recycle PET flakes had an iv specification of 0.68 to 0.78 dl/g and a melting point specification of 245&#xb0; C. to 255&#xb0; C. The PVC content was less than 10 ppm by specification. The butanediol was obtained from BASF and had a purity specification of &#x3e;99.5 wt. %. The ethylene glycol was obtained from Merck Co. and had a purity specification of &#x3e;99.5 wt. % The TPT catalyst used was the commercial Tyzor grade available from Dupont.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Depolymerization of PET flakes was carried out at a mole ratio of PET (&#x2018;mer&#x2019; repeat unit) to EG in the range of 1:0.8 to 1:2.0 to make the depolymerization product. The reaction was conducted in the presence of catalyst (titanium, antimony or tin compounds (range from 50 to 125 ppm)). The process was carried out under a pressure in the range 1.0 bar &#x2212;6 bar and at a temperature of 200 Deg C. to 260 Deg C.). The total time of depolymerization was in the range from 20 to 120 min and preferably 30 to 100 min. This is further followed by filtration of the mass to remove black specs and other insoluble impurities. The resulting mass was called the first mixture.

Transesterification&#x2014;Preparation of Second Mixture (at Atmospheric Pressure)
</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Transesterification was done by reacting the first mixture with BDO with or without cocatalyst. The cocatalyst in some of the examples was sodium methoxide of (10-14 ppm). The BDO was taken in excess over the stoichiometric requirement and the mole ratio of excess to stoichiometric requirement ranged from 2.0 to 4.0. The reaction was conducted in the presence of additional amount of catalyst (50-120 ppm of Ti, Sn or Sb catalysts or combinations thereof) at temperature range of 200 to 245 Deg C. and more preferably 210 to 235 Deg C. at atmospheric pressure for 10-40 min and more preferably 15-30 min. During this period, the vapors were passed through a distillation column wherein the EG and THF were removed after separation from BDO which was refluxed back into the reactor. This resulted in the reaction mass called second mixture. The second mixture was not characterized and the reaction was continued as given below to form the third mixture.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Preparation of Third Mixture (at Pressures in the Range from 95 kPa to 50 kPa)</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In Examples 1-4, the second mixture was subjected to a pressure initially in the range of 95 to 80 kPa for a period of 10-40 min and more preferably 15-30 min. During this period, the temperature was controlled between 190 and 235 (C) and more preferably between 190 and 220 deg C. and the vapors were subjected to distillation and much of the BDO of condensed vapors was refluxed back accompanied by the removal of EG, THF and minor amounts of BDO. At this stage, 80% of total EG present both as free and as bound was removed by distillation during transesterification. Subsequently, the pressure was reduced gradually to a range from 80 to 50 kPa and the temperature was maintained between 190 and 235 deg C. and more preferably between 190 and 220 deg C. The total time for transesterification was maintained between 30 to 150 min and preferably between 90 to 120 min. EG, THF and minor amount of BDO were removed by distillation and as before, much of the BDO was continuously refluxed back into the reactor. In examples 5-9, the pressure was lowered from atmospheric to 60 kPa slowly, and held at 60 kPa for a period from 20-150 minutes and more preferably from 30-60 minutes. The temperature was maintained between 190 and 235 deg C. and more preferably between 190 and 220 deg C. and the vapors were subjected to distillation and much of the BDO of condensed vapors was refluxed back accompanied by the removal of EG, THF and minor amounts of BDO. This resulted in the formation of a third mixture. The reaction conditions employed and the amounts of various ingredients collected in the distillate at the end of transesterification are shown in Table 3.1</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Recycling the BDO enables a favorable BDO to EG ratio in the transesterification reactor, and improves productivity by lowering the transesterification time. EG was reused in the depolymerization step and BDO was reused in the transesterification step. The THF and water mixture were sent to storage vessels.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Polycondensation</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Polycondensation using the third mixture was done at a temperature in the range from 230 to 265 Deg C. and preferably 245 to 255 Deg C. The pressure was gradually reduced to a level of 0.01 kPa to 1 kPa to enable molecular weight build-up. The reaction was conducted within a time span of 45 to 120 min and preferably 45 to 75 min. During polycondensation, excess BDO and residual EG was removed, along with THF and Water. The vapor byproducts were subjected to distillation to separate EG, BDO, THF and water mixture. The final polymer product (PBT) had an I.V. ranging in between 0.5 and 1.5 dl/gm and EG and DEG content less than 0.4 wt. % each based on final polymer. Typically, the IPA content was less than 2% in the polymer. The melting point of the final polymer was in the range of 215 to 222 Deg C. The experimental conditions used for polycondensation and the composition of the distillates are shown in Table 4.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The examples, as per Table 7 show that the process is versatile and can produce modified polybutylene terephthalate copolymers at different THF production levels. The process of the invention enables production of much lesser formation of THF than the comparative examples C. Ex. 1 and C. Ex. 2 (see Table 7). Also, Examples 8 and 9 where sodium methoxide additive was used, the THF amount formed was the lowest % relative to the amount of PBT made. Also from the examples 1-9, a lower % of THF was formed wherever the time of transesterification as shown in Table 3 was lower.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In order to get a high value of intrinsic viscosity (IV) for the PET derived PBT, a low viscosity sample from example 4 (IV=0.79) was subjected to solid state polymerization in a tumbling reactor at 100 mbar pressure at a temperature of 190-220 deg C. for about 48 to 72 h. The intrinsic viscosity was checked intermittently during the viscosity build-up and a product with a final intrinsic viscosity value of 1.19 was obtained. This example 10 is illustrative of a process for obtaining polymer samples of PET derived PBT of high intrinsic viscosity.</p>

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In a 2.0 liter RB flask on an oil bath with overhead stirrer and condenser arrangement, 200 grams (1.69 m) of bio Succinic acid, 1.0 liter of dry Ethyl alcohol and 5-8 drops of concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>were charged and heated to reflux for 8 hrs. After 8 hrs the alcohol was distilled off, 500 ml dichloromethane was added, and washed with 450 ml of 10% sodium carbonate solution to get distinctly alkaline pH. The organic layer was washed with water and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed and the diester product was distilled off under vacuum.

<p id="p-0119" num="0121">60 grams (2.6 moles) of clean sodium was placed in a 3 liter RB flask fitted with condenser, overhead stirrer, thermo well and an addition funnel. A mild nitrogen flow was maintained to the flask to keep an inert atmosphere. The nitrogen blanket was removed and a solution of 35 grams (0.2 moles) of diethyl succinate in 700 ml dry ethyl alcohol was added from the dropping funnel, as rapidly as possible keeping the reaction under control. If necessary, external cooling may be applied to keep the reaction under control. The reaction mass was then heated to 120-130&#xb0; C. for 90 minutes till all the sodium dissolved. Then the reaction mass was cooled to room temp and 25 ml of water was cautiously added. The reaction mixture was refluxed for another 30 minutes to get the unreacted ester hydrolyzed (if any) and then 270 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to the cold mixture. The precipitated sodium chloride was filtered off and the filtrate was treated with 300 grams anhydrous potassium carbonate to free it from water. The alcoholic solution was filtered off and the solids were washed with hot alcohol (2&#xd7;100 ml), the alcohol was removed by distillation. Dry acetone (200-250 ml) was added to the residue, the solids were filtered off and then the acetone was distilled to get the crude BDO. The crude BDO was further distilled under vacuum to get pure fraction at 135-138&#xb0; C. (20 mm Hg pressure). The weight of BDO obtained in this experiment was 8 gms and the yield was measured to be 45% on the basis of the amount of ester charged.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0124">PET (recycle) 3.5 g (18.23 mmol), ethylene glycol 1.69 g (27.26 mmol) were added to a reactor, and heated to 180&#xb0; C. under nitrogen atmosphere. At 180&#xb0; C., the catalyst tetraisopropylorthotitanate (TPT)200 ppm was added and heating was continued to 225-230&#xb0; C. and kept for 90 minutes. 5.6 g (62.22 mmol) of 1,4-butanediol (BDO) derived from bio Succinic acid was added to the reaction mass and continued the reaction for another 15 minutes with distilling off ethylene glycol and butane diol from the reaction. Vacuum was applied in a stepwise manner starting from 700 mbar to 500, 300, 100, 75, 50, 25, 10, 5.5, 1.5 and finally to less than 1.0 mbar. The molten reaction mass kept at 0.7 to 0.5 mbar for 30 minutes and finally the polymer was drained off the reactor under nitrogen pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0125">The polyester we obtained had an IV of 0.7 dL/g, melting temperature (Tm) 215&#xb0; C. The polyester had a weight average molecular weight of 57517 and a number average molecular weight of 13969 (Mw/Mn=4.12). The <sup>1</sup>H NMR of the polyester showed 96.4 mol % butane diol incorporation and 3.6 mol % of residual ethylene glycol incorporation.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0126">In all the examples above where PBT was derived from PET, the process for making the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymers exhibited a reduced CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions index that was more than one, (1) (more than 1 kg of CO<sub>2 </sub>was reduced for every kg of modified PBT copolymer that was made). The example of PBT made from PET and bio-based BDO illustrates that the CO<sub>2 </sub>impact can be further reduced by using monomer derived from biomass.</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0128">Green colored recycle PET pellets were obtained from St. Jude, a supplier in North America. The post consumer recycle PET pellets had an iv specification of 0.68 to 0.78 and a melting point specification of 245 to 255 C. The butanediol was obtained from BASF and had a purity specification of &#x3e;99.5 wt. %. The TPT catalyst is the commercial Tyzor grade available from Dupont.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0129">The recycle PET pellets were mixed with butanediol and ethylene glycol in a 500 ml reaction kettle as per the recipe shown in Table 9. The temperature of the oil bath (for the reaction kettle) was ramped up from 180 to 255&#xb0; C. The agitator speed was set at 20 rpm. At this stage, 0.2 ml of TPT catalyst was also added to the reaction mix. The reaction mass achieved an equilibrium temperature (boiling point of mixture) and the diol mixture was refluxed at this temperature for 2 hours. This is known as the PET glycolysis stage.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0130">For the poly stage, the reflux condenser was removed and a vacuum was applied to the reaction kettle. The volatilized solvents were collected in a separate condenser. The speed of the agitator was increased to 220 rpm. The system pressure was brought down to 0.15 Torr (0.199 kPa) by the vacuum pump. The polymer molecular weight increased rapidly at this stage as was evident by the rod climbing of the molten mass. The reaction was stopped after 20 minutes in the poly stage. About 10 gms of the polymer was collected from the reaction kettle for further testing and analysis. Results of tests conducted on the polymer samples include intrinsic viscosity (iv) data, composition of the polymer by NMR analysis and Crystallization data by DSC analysis and they are presented in Table 10.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0133">The examples above show that when the ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and isophthalic acid groups in a total amount that is more than 0 and less than or equal to 23 equivalents relative to the total of 100 equivalents of diol and 100 equivalents of diacid groups in the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer, the melting temperature Tm is below the desired amount of 200&#xb0; C. It is noteworthy that the Tm of compositions shown in Examples 1-9 is more than 200&#xb0; C. when the ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and isophthalic acid groups in a total amount that is more than 0 and less than or equal to 23 equivalents relative to the total of 100 equivalents of diol and 100 equivalents of diacid groups in the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer. These examples prove that one can tailor the crystallinity and the melting point of the PET derived PBT based on the diol ratio used for the transesterification and the repolymerization stage. The glycolysis stage is quite flexible since one can use any diol or mixture of diols to depolymerize the PET. In the transesterification and the repolymerization stage, it is preferred to keep a butanediol rich environment by removing the other diols. By maintaining a butanediol rich environment, one can then obtain a PET derived PBT copolymer with properties similar to that of virgin PBT.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-087.631 filed on Mar. 28, 2008, and the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-068.300 filed on Mar. 19, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a light emitting device, and more particularly to a light emitting device which is lit whenever it is directly connected to a convenience receptacle of an AC power source or a terminal of a DC power source.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are very popular, and are used as backup lights for electronic devices such as cellular phones, digital video cameras, personal digital assistances and so on. Light emitting diodes are also used as light emitting sources for displays, roadway signs, traffic signals and so on. In recent days, light emitting diodes are being widely applied as vehicle headlights, and ordinary lighting fixtures in place of electric bulbs and fluorescent bulbs. Usually, a battery unit serves as a power source for vehicle headlights, and supplies DC power. Generally, a battery voltage is 5 V, 6 V, 12 V, 9 V or 24 V. A commercial power source is applied to ordinary lighting fixtures, and provides AC power to them. A voltage of the AC power is 100 V, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A forward voltage V<sub>f </sub>of the light emitting diode is 3.8 V to 3.9 V, and is lower than a voltage of the battery and a voltage of the commercial power source. Therefore, the light emitting diode is destroyed when the DC power or the commercial power is directly applied between an anode electrode and a cathode electrode of the light emitting diode.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For the foregoing reasons, the light emitting diode itself is not utilized as a lighting fixture, but is applied as a light emitting device in combination with an AC/DC power supply circuit including voltage dividing resistors and a complicated circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An example of the foregoing light emitting device is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication No. 2004-14899.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the related art, the voltage dividing resistors and power supply circuit tend to increase the number of electronic components to be assembled, and lead to a complicated configuration, which means that the light emitting device becomes expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention has been contemplated to overcome the foregoing problems, and provides a light emitting device which does not need electronic components such as voltage dividing circuits and a power supply circuit, can have a simplified configuration, and can be fabricated at a reduced cost. Further, the invention provides a light emitting device which can be directly and easily connected to a battery or a commercial power source</p>

The first light emitting element <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) includes: a first electrode <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>) electrically connected to a main surface <b>12</b>S of the second semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>); a first active layer <b>153</b>(<b>1</b>) and a second electrode <b>154</b>(<b>2</b>) on the first electrode <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>), all of which are stacked one over another.

The conductor <b>17</b> electrically connects the second electrode <b>154</b>(<b>2</b>) of the first light emitting element <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) to the third semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>2</b>), and electrically connects the second electrode <b>154</b>(<b>2</b>) to the third electrode <b>152</b>(<b>3</b>) via the third semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>2</b>). The first pad <b>172</b> is electrically connected to the first electrode <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>) via the second semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>), and electrically connects the first light emitting element <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) to the terminal <b>1012</b> of the power source <b>100</b>. The second pad <b>171</b> is electrically connected to the fourth electrode <b>154</b>(<b>4</b>), and electrically connects the n number light emitting element <b>15</b>(<i>n</i>) to the terminal <b>1011</b> of the power source <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the first embodiment, the first conductivity type is the &#x201c;n&#x201d; type while the second conductivity type is the &#x201c;p&#x201d; type. The first semiconductor region <b>10</b>N is an n type silicon single crystal substrate. The silicon single crystal substrate carries the first and third semiconductor regions <b>12</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>12</b>(<b>2</b>) and other semiconductor regions on its the main surface <b>10</b>S where a main surface <b>12</b>S is present, and is also used to epitaxially grow a part of the light emitting elements <b>15</b> as thin films. The silicon single crystal substrate is 100 &#x3bc;m to 1000 &#x3bc;m thick. Specifically, the silicon single crystal substrate is designed to be several hundred &#x3bc;m thick, and has relatively low impurity density of approximately 1&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 5&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>in order that a depletion layer sufficiently extends to the semiconductor region <b>10</b>N.</p>

The second semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>) and the third semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>2</b>) are respectively in a state of the pn junction isolation with the first semiconductor region <b>10</b>N. For this purpose, a potential having a reverse bias is applied to the first semiconductor region <b>10</b>N.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, the second and third semiconductor regions <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>) and <b>12</b>P(<b>2</b>) are used as a part of the conductor which is electrically connected in series between the light emitting elements <b>15</b>, and constitute the resistors <b>12</b>R, diodes <b>12</b>D and capacitors <b>12</b>C. Each resistor <b>12</b>R is constituted by the second semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>) and the third semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>2</b>). An ohmic value of the resistors <b>12</b>R depends upon density of the p type impurities, and a length and a sectional area of a current flowing path. In diodes <b>12</b>D, the second and third semiconductor regions <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>) and <b>12</b>P(<b>2</b>) function as anode regions, and the first semiconductor region <b>10</b>N functions as a cathode region.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The first light emitting element <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) includes the following: a buffer layers <b>151</b> in direct contact with the main surface <b>12</b>S of the second semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>); a first electrode <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>) on the buffer layer <b>151</b>; a first active layer <b>153</b>(<b>1</b>) on the first electrode <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>); a second electrode <b>154</b>(<b>2</b>) on the first active layer <b>153</b>(<b>1</b>); and an optically transparent conductive film <b>155</b> on the second electrode <b>154</b>(<b>2</b>). The second light emitting element <b>15</b>(<b>2</b>) includes the following: a buffer layer <b>151</b> in direct contact with the main surface <b>12</b>S of the third semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>2</b>); a third electrode <b>152</b>(<b>3</b>) arranged on the buffer layer <b>151</b>; a second active layer <b>153</b>(<b>2</b>) on the third electrode <b>152</b>(<b>3</b>); a fourth electrode <b>154</b>(<b>4</b>) on the second active layer <b>153</b>(<b>2</b>); and an optically transparent conductive film <b>155</b> on the fourth electrode <b>154</b>(<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the first embodiment, each buffer layer <b>151</b> is of the n type, is made of a nitride group semiconductor, and includes nitride aluminum (AlN) layers doped with n type impurities and nitride gallium (GaN) layers doped with n type impurities. The nitride aluminum (AlN) layers and nitride gallium (GaN) layers are alternately stacked. For instance, each AlN layer is 0.5 nm to 5.0 nm thick while each GaN layer is 5 nm to 5500 nm thick.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The buffer layers <b>151</b> are not always required to be constituted by a plurality of the AlN layers and GaN layers. The AlN layers may be replaced by nitride group semiconductor layers such as indium aluminum nitride (AlInN) layers, gallium aluminum nitride (AlGaN) layers, and gallium indium aluminum nitride (AlInGaN) layers. Further, the GaN layers may be replaced by nitride group semiconductor layers such as gallium indium nitride (InGaN) layers, AlInN, AlGaN layers, and AlInGaN layers. Still further, each buffer layer <b>151</b> may be a single AlN layer, a single GaN layer, or a single layer of nitride group semiconductors. The buffer layers <b>151</b> may be omitted if the layers of the first light emitting element <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) demonstrate excellent epitaxial growth on the main surface <b>12</b>S of the second semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>) and the layers of the third semiconductor region <b>15</b>(<b>2</b>) demonstrate excellent epitaxial growth on the main surface <b>12</b>S of the third semiconductor region and <b>12</b>P(<b>2</b>). It is assumed here that the first and third electrodes <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>152</b>(<b>3</b>) on the buffer layers <b>151</b> are made of n type semiconductor layers. This means that the buffer layers <b>151</b> have the conductivity same as that of the first and third electrodes <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>152</b>(<b>3</b>). In such a case, the buffer layers <b>151</b> in combination with the first electrode <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>) may function as the first electrode, and the buffer layers <b>151</b> in combination with the third electrode <b>152</b>(<b>3</b>) may function as the third electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The first electrode <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>) is an n type clad layer disposed between the buffer layer <b>151</b> and the first active layer <b>153</b>(<b>1</b>).

The n type clad layer have a band gap which is larger than band gaps of the first and second active layers <b>153</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>153</b>(<b>2</b>). Nitride group semiconductors such as n type GaN layers are used as the n type clad layers. Alternatively, the n type clad layers may be chemical group semiconductors such as AlInGaN and AlGaN.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In order to constitute a double hetero junction LED, the first active layer <b>153</b>(<b>1</b>) is placed between the first electrode <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>) (n type clad layer) and the second electrode <b>154</b>(<b>2</b>) (p type clad layer).

The first and second active layers <b>153</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>153</b>(<b>2</b>) are made of nitride group semiconductors such as InGaN.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the first and second active layers <b>153</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>153</b>(<b>2</b>) is schematically depicted as one layer, but is in the shape of the multiquantum well (MQW). Alternatively, each of the first and second active layers <b>153</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>153</b>(<b>2</b>) may be in the shape of a single quantum well (SQW) or in the shape of a single semiconductor layer. The first active layer <b>153</b>(<b>1</b>) may be omitted if the first and second electrodes <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>154</b>(<b>2</b>) are directly joined. The second active layer <b>153</b>(<b>3</b>) may be omitted if the third and fourth electrodes <b>152</b>(<b>3</b>) and <b>154</b>(<b>4</b>) are directly joined.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Both of the second and fourth electrodes <b>154</b>(<b>2</b>) and <b>154</b>(<b>4</b>) are p type clad layers, which have large bandgaps compared to band gaps of the first and second active layers <b>153</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>153</b>(<b>2</b>). The p-type clad layers are made of nitride group semiconductors such as p type GaN semiconductor layers.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Each optically transparent conductive film <b>155</b> is laid on the second and fourth electrodes <b>154</b>(<b>2</b>) and <b>154</b>(<b>4</b>), and is connected to them with low resistance (i.e. is in ohmic contact with them). The optically transparent conductive films <b>155</b> are made of indium tin oxide (ITO) layers, for instance, and function to unify a distribution of currents flowing to the semiconductor light emitting elements <b>15</b>. The optically transparent conductive films <b>155</b> may be omitted if no uniform current distribution is required.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The first electrode <b>152</b>(<b>1</b>) of the first light emitting element <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) is electrically connected to the first pad <b>172</b> via the buffer layer <b>151</b> of the first light emitting element <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) and the second semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>). An interlayer dielectric film <b>16</b> is provided on a side surface of the first light emitting element <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>), or on the main surface <b>12</b>S of the second semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>). The first pad <b>172</b> is placed on the interlayer dielectric film <b>16</b>. The first pad <b>172</b> and the second semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>) are connected through a via hole <b>162</b> made in the interlayer dielectric film <b>16</b>.

Further, the third semiconductor region <b>12</b>P(<b>2</b>) made of p type silicon and the n type buffer layer <b>151</b> of the second light emitting element <b>15</b>(<b>2</b>) are in electrical contact with each other. The electrical contact is the hetero junction. It is inferred that an alloyed region (not shown) is created on contact interfacial areas of the foregoing components. Therefore, when a forward voltage is applied to the first and second light emitting elements <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>15</b>(<b>2</b>), a voltage drop is small in the hetero junction between the forgoing components compared with a voltage drop in the hetero junction between n type silicon and an n type buffer layers. The voltage drop is approximately 0.4 V in the hetero junction. If an n type buffer layer made of a nitride semiconductor such as a GaN semiconductor is formed on n type silicon, III group elements of Ga or the like serve as p type impurities to the silicon, and cause a pn junction in the n type silicon. The pn junction leads to a voltage drop. It is assumed that the second and third semiconductor regions <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>) and <b>12</b>P(<b>2</b>) and so on are made of n type silicon, and that the n type buffer <b>151</b> is formed on these semiconductor regions. In such a case, the voltage drop in the hetero junction is relatively small, the first semiconductor region <b>10</b>N is made to be a semiconductor region constituted by p type silicon, so that the second and third semiconductor regions <b>12</b>P(<b>1</b>) and <b>12</b>P(<b>2</b>) and so on may be replaced with semiconductor regions made of the n type silicon.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the light emitting device of the first embodiment, a plurality of light emitting elements <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>15</b>(<i>n</i>) which are in the shape of minute cells are arranged as an aggregate on the first semiconductor region <b>10</b>N, or one semiconductor chip. The light emitting elements <b>15</b> in the shape of the minute cells can efficiently emit light from the side surfaces thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is assumed here that a distance L<b>1</b> is present along the planar normal line between a light emitting point P of the light emitting elements <b>15</b> and the main surface <b>10</b>S of the first semiconductor region <b>10</b>N, and that a distance L<b>2</b> to the incident point P is present between the light emitting point P and the main surface <b>10</b>S of the first semiconductor region (silicon substrate) <b>10</b>N. The relationship is established between an incident angle &#x3b8; and an interfacial reflection ratio as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the abscissa denotes the incident angle &#x3b8; of light which is emitted at the light emitting point P and is incident onto the main surface <b>10</b>P of the first semiconductor region (silicon substrate) <b>10</b>N. The incident angle &#x3b8; is defined by the planar normal line of the main surface <b>10</b>P and an angle of an optical axis of the incident light. The ordinate denotes the interfacial reflection ratio (%) defined by the main surface <b>10</b>S and the light emitting elements <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When the incident angle of light emitted from the light emitting point P is approximately 0 degrees to 60 degrees as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the light will be absorbed at the first semiconductor region <b>10</b>N. Since the reflection ratio of the main surface <b>10</b>S is small, an expected amount of reflected light is not so large. If the incident angle of the light is approximately 70 degrees to 90 degrees, the reflection ratio is increased at the interfacial surface, so that the reflected light will be present as expected. The distance L<b>2</b> from the light emitting point P cannot be infinite. An increase of the reflection ratio and an increase of planar dimensions of light emitting windows are balanced in appropriate ranges. The increase of planar dimensions of the light emitting windows results from an increased number of arrays of the light emitting elements <b>15</b> since the light emitting elements <b>15</b> are minimized in the shape of minute cells. In the first embodiment, the distance L<b>1</b> between the light emitting point P and the main surface <b>10</b>P is 2 &#x3bc;m, for instance while the distance L<b>2</b> between the light emitting point P and the incident position is 11 &#x3bc;m, for instance. Therefore, the light from the light emitting point P is incident at the incident position with the incident angle &#x3b8; of approximately 80 degrees. Although approximately 60% of the light from the light emitting point P is absorbed at the incident position, a high reflection ratio of 40% is accomplished. With the light emitting device <b>1</b>, it is possible to increase the dimensional areas of the light emitting windows, the light reflection ratio at the interfacial surface, and a ratio of light emission from the side surfaces. In the first embodiment, the length of the light emitting elements <b>15</b> is designed in order to improve the light emitting ratio.</p>

<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the light emitting device <b>1</b> is specifically constituted by: a substrate <b>10</b>; first electrodes <b>152</b> on the substrate <b>10</b>; an active layer <b>153</b> on the first electrodes <b>152</b>; second electrodes <b>154</b> on the active layer <b>153</b>; a plurality of light emitting elements <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>15</b>(<i>n</i>); and a conductor <b>17</b> connecting the first electrode <b>152</b> of the light emitting element <b>15</b>(<b>2</b>), for instance, to the second electrode <b>154</b> of the light emitting electrode <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>), for instance.

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In this third embodiment, the substrate <b>10</b> is a sapphire substrate which demonstrates excellent crystalline characteristics of an epitaxial layer on the main surface <b>10</b>S. Alternatively, the substrate <b>10</b> may be an insulating substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The first electrodes <b>152</b> of the light emitting elements <b>15</b> are placed on the substrate <b>10</b> via a buffer layer <b>151</b>, and are made of an n type nitride semiconductor region, i.e. an n type GaN layer. The active layer <b>153</b> is made of MQW in order to constitute a double hetero junction LED. The MQW is the same as that used in the first embodiment. The second electrodes <b>154</b> are made of a p type semiconductor region, i.e. a p type GaN layer.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The conductor <b>17</b> has its one end electrically connected to the first electrodes <b>152</b> of the light emitting elements <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>15</b>(<i>n</i>) and the other end electrically connected to the second electrodes <b>154</b> of the light emitting elements <b>15</b>. The light emitting elements <b>15</b> are covered by an interlayer dielectric film <b>16</b>. The conductor <b>17</b> has its opposite ends connected to the first electrode <b>152</b> and the second electrode <b>154</b> via holes <b>162</b> and <b>161</b> of the interlayer dielectric film <b>16</b>. The interlayer film <b>16</b> is preferably made of a silicon oxide film. The other end of the conductor <b>17</b> and the second electrodes <b>154</b> are connected via an optically transparent conductive film <b>155</b>, which is made of an ITO layer used as the optically transparent conductive film <b>155</b> in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The conductor <b>17</b> is made of a conductive material having the Shottkey effect (non-ohmic chracteristics) with respect the first electrodes <b>152</b>. The resisters Rs are created when the conductor <b>17</b> comes into contact with the first electrodes <b>152</b>. In this embodiment, the conductor <b>17</b> includes a titanium layer <b>17</b><i>a </i>placed on the n type GaN layer used as a barrier metal layer, for instance, and a gold (Au) layer <b>17</b><i>b </i>on the titanium layer <b>17</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The conductor <b>17</b> is fabricated as follows. First of all, the Ti layer is made to a thickness of 15 nm to 25 nm by the vapor deposition or spattering technology. The Ti layer is subject to the nitriding treatment for approximately one minute. Thereafter, a further Ti layer is made to a thickness of 15 nm to 25 nm by the vapor deposition or spattering technology. The Au layer having a thickness of 600 nm to 800 nm is made on the Ti layer by the vapor deposition or spattering technology. The Au layer is subject to the heat treatment at 350&#xb0; C. for 5 to 10 minutes, so that the conductor <b>17</b> is completed. An etching mask is prepared by the photolithographic process. The conductor <b>17</b> is etched and patterned as predetermined using the etching mask.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The conductor <b>17</b> is connected to the first electrodes <b>152</b> of the light emitting elements <b>15</b>, and the resistors Rs are created at the junctions between the conductor <b>17</b> and the first electrodes <b>152</b>. The resistors Rs are provided for the light emitting elements <b>15</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>15</b>(<i>n</i>) on one to one basis, and function as a series resistor, which enables the light emitting device <b>1</b> to cope with extensive variations of an AC voltage. When the first electrodes <b>152</b> of the light emitting elements <b>15</b> are made of the n type GaN layer, the conductor <b>17</b> constituted by the stacked Ti and Al layers in order to demonstrate excellent ohmic characteristics is used for the n type GaN layer. Since substantially no resistance component is applied to the junctions between the conductor <b>17</b> and the light emitting elements <b>15</b>, the current (I)-voltage (V) characteristics are excellent. When the power source <b>100</b> connected to the light emitting device <b>1</b> supplies the DC power, the I-V characteristics are excellent.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">However, when the power source <b>100</b> supplies the AC power, e.g. 100 V home electrical power, to the light emitting device <b>1</b>, the AC power has a variable voltage. Specifically, when the power source <b>100</b> supplies the 100 V power, a maximum voltage 140 V will be actually supplied to the light emitting device <b>1</b>. In such a case, a large current will flow to the light emitting device <b>1</b>, which may be subject to thermal destruction. In order to overcome this problem, a high resistance element (an external resistance element) is usually used for the light emitting device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the third embodiment, the resistors Rs are used for the light emitting device <b>1</b> without using the external resistor in order to enable the light emitting device <b>1</b> to reliably emit light even if the power source <b>100</b> supplies the AC power having the voltage of 100 V to a maximum voltage of 140 V. The resistors Rs are provided for the light emitting elements <b>15</b> on one to one basis, so that the forward voltage can be increased by an amount of the Shottkey voltage for each of the light emitting elements <b>15</b>, and it is possible to suppress an abrupt increase of the voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the light emitting device <b>1</b> has to be operated in a low voltage range in order to accomplish the foregoing effect. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the ordinate denotes a resistance value (Q) of the resistors Rs while the abscissa denotes a current value (mA). Curve A denotes characteristics of the resistors Rs when the conductor <b>17</b> is made of the conductive material (stacked Ti layer <b>17</b><i>a </i>and Au layer <b>17</b><i>b</i>). Curve B relates to a comparison example of a resistor when a conductor is made of a conductive material having ohmic characteristics such as stacked Ti and Al layers.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In a high current range of 10 mA or higher as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the resistance value of the resistors Rs of the present invention remains substantially invariable even if the current value in the resistors Rs varies (e.g. increases). This holds true to the resistor of the comparison example. In a low current range of 10 mA or lower, the resistors Rs extensively increase the resistance value in response to a decrease of the current value, compared to the resistor of the comparison example. In short, it is possible to increase the resistance value of the resistors Rs in the low current range. Further, the light emitting element <b>15</b> made of a nitride semiconductor can effectively emit light at a low current of 10 mA or lower. Therefore, the light emitting device <b>1</b> of the third embodiment can improve the light emitting efficiency of the light emitting elements <b>15</b>. In the light emitting device <b>1</b> of this third embodiment, in order to accomplish a high resistance value of the resistors Rs, the Shottoky junction area is enlarged while a light emitting area is minimized. For instance, the light emitting elements <b>15</b> are designed to be actuated by a current which is equal to or less than 10 mA, specifically 1 mA or less, when the voltage range is 90 V to 140 V.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to light emitting diodes (LEDs). The present invention relates more particularly to a heat sink base for enhancing the optical performance of a LED by reducing the temperature of one or more junctions of the LED and/or by reducing the temperature of one or more phosphors of the LED.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are well known. As the cost of LEDs continues to fall and as they become more efficient, more different applications are being found for them and the applications are becoming more sophisticated. For example, LEDs are being used to provide light in such applications as flashlights, displays, and general illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In such applications, LEDs replace light bulbs or lamps. In order to provide the desired amount and quality of light (the amount and quality similar to that provided by light bulbs or lamps), sufficiently bright LEDs are required. However, brighter LEDs require more current and more current results in the production of more heat. Heat reduces the efficiency of LEDs and undesirable generates color shifts.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, although contemporary LEDs have proven generally suitable for some purposes, they possess inherent deficiencies which detract from their overall effectiveness and desirability. Therefore, it is desirable to provide LEDs that can more efficiently use higher current, such as by better managing the heat produced thereby.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods and systems are disclosed herein to provide cooling for light emitting diodes (LEDs). In accordance with an aspect, an LED assembly can comprise a heat sink base, at least one LED die attached to the heat sink base, and a heat sink attached the heat sink base.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with an aspect, an LED assembly can comprise a heat sink base, at least one LED die attached to the heat sink base, and means for dissipating heat attached the heat sink base.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with an aspect, a heat sink base can comprise a heat conductive member that is configured to facilitate the attachment of at least one LED die thereto and that is configured to facilitate the attachment of a heat sink thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an aspect, a heat sink assembly for LEDs can comprise a heat sink base that is configured to facilitate the attachment of at least one LED die thereto and heat sink fins attachable to the heat sink base.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an aspect, a heat sink assembly for LEDs can comprise a heat sink base having a ledge that is configured to mitigate leakage of light from an LED die past a lens.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with an aspect, a method for making an LED assembly can comprise attaching at least one LED die to a heat sink base and attaching heat sink fins to the heat sink base.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">By providing enhanced heat dissipation from the LED dice, more current can be used so as to provide brighter LEDs that are suitable for use in such applications as flashlights, displays, and general lighting. Further, by providing enhanced heat dissipation for the LED dice, phosphors can be maintained at a lower temperature, such that the phosphors operate more efficiently. When phosphors operate more efficiently, desired colors can be provided thereby more reliably.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments and aspects of the present invention and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Methods and systems for enhancing the optical performance of a LED by reducing the temperature Tj of a junction or active area of the LED and/or by reducing the temperature of one or more phosphors of the LED are disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As discussed above, the heat produced by current flow through a light emitting diode (LED) can be accommodated, so as to facilitate the use of the higher currents that are required in order to provide brighter LEDs. The temperature T<sub>j </sub>of the junction of an LED must typically be kept below approximately 150&#xb0; C. in order for the LED to produce light efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The temperature of any phosphors that are used to modify the color of light for an LED must be as low as possible so as to provide desired color conversion efficiency. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the Stokes shift will tend to cause the phosphors to heat up. The Stokes shift is the difference in the energy levels between the absorption spectra and the emission spectra of a fluorescent material. Since more energy is absorbed as visible light than is emitted as visible light, the difference in energy becomes heat.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As the color conversion efficiency of the phosphors of an LED drops, the color of the light produced thereby changes. Thus, it is necessary to maintain a desired color conversion efficiency so as to reliably provide the desired color of light.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An LED assembly can include a heat sink base, at least one LED die attached to the heat sink base, and a lens. One or more layers of phosphor can be formed upon the lens. A heat sink, such as a finned heat sink, can attach the heat sink base to the first lens. Heat from the LED die can flow through the heat sink base to the heat sink, from which the heat can be dissipated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Similarly, heat from phosphors can flow through the lens to the heat sink, from which the heat can be dissipated. By removing heat from the LED die, more current can be used to drive the LED die, thus providing brighter light. By removing heat from the phosphors, desired colors can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One or more aspects mitigate the temperature of the junction of an LED. Reducing the temperature of an LED increases the efficiency thereof. The use of higher current is thus facilitated. The use of higher current facilitates the production of brighter LEDs that are better suited for use in applications such as flashlights, displays, and general illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One or more aspects mitigate the temperature of any phosphors that are used to modify the color of an LED. By keeping the phosphors at a lower temperature, better efficiency of the phosphors is maintained. In this manner, the desired color of light from the LED is more reliably provided.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with an aspect, an LED assembly can comprise a heat sink base, at least one LED die attached to the heat sink base, and a heat sink attached to the heat sink base. The heat sink can have fins formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A lens can be attached to the heat sink. The lens can comprise a lump lens. The lens can comprise any other desired type of lens. A phosphor layer can be formed upon the lens. For example, a phosphor layer can be formed upon a surface of the lens that is closest to the LED die. Another lens can be formed upon the heat sink base, such that the other lens substantially covers the LED die/dice.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The heat sink base can comprise a material that is substantially heat transmissive. For example, the heat sink base can comprise copper, aluminum, or steel. The heat sink base can comprise a material having a thermal conductivity greater than 100 W/mK.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Vias can be formed in the heat sink base. Electrical conductors within the vias can provide power to the LED die/dice. The electrical conductors that pass through the via can cooperate with conductive traces formed upon the heat sink base so as to power the LED die/dice.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The LED assembly can comprise either one or a plurality of LED dice that are attached to the heat sink base. For example, the LED assembly can comprise 1, 2, 4, 8, or any other desired number of LED die.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The heat sink can be bolted to the heat sink base. The heat sink can at least partially define a seal that inhibits light leakage from the LED die/dice. For example, the heat sink can at least partially define a ledge that inhibits light leakage from the LED die/dice.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a contemporary LED assembly has LED dice <b>101</b> attached to a substrate <b>102</b>. The substrate <b>102</b> can comprise aluminum (Al) or copper (Cu). The substrate <b>102</b> is attached to a heat sink base <b>103</b> via screws <b>111</b>. A thermal interface material (TIM) <b>110</b> is used to improve heat transfer from the substrate <b>102</b> to the heat sink base <b>103</b>. The substrate <b>102</b> and heat sink base <b>103</b> are generally round when viewed from above.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Positive <b>106</b> and negative <b>107</b> leads cooperate with wire bonds (not shown) to provide current to the LED dice <b>101</b>. Conductive traces can be formed upon the substrate <b>102</b> to facilitate the communication of current from the positive <b>106</b> and negative <b>107</b> leads to the LED dice <b>101</b> (via the wire bonds).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A layer of phosphors <b>112</b> change the color of light emitted by the LED dice <b>101</b>. Thus, more desirable colors can be provided by the LED assembly. For example, the phosphors <b>112</b> can be used to change the color of light emitted by the LED dice <b>101</b> from blue to a substantially white color.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A lens <b>113</b> is formed over the layer of phosphors <b>112</b> and focuses light from the LED dice <b>101</b>. The lens <b>113</b> is formed of silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Heat sink fins <b>104</b> can be formed integrally with the heat sink base <b>103</b>. Alternatively, the heat sink fins <b>104</b> can be formed separately with respect to the heat sink base <b>103</b> and then attached thereto, such as via fasteners. The heat sink fins <b>104</b> radiate heat from the heat sink base <b>103</b> into the ambient air. Thus, heat from the LED dice <b>101</b> can be dissipated, at least to some degree.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A lens <b>108</b> is attached to the heat sink fins <b>104</b>. The lens <b>108</b> is held in place via a ring holder <b>109</b>. The ring holder <b>109</b> is attached to the heat sink fins <b>104</b> by screws <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thermal resistance is a measure of how readily heat flows through an object. The higher the thermal resistance, the less readily heat flows. The substrate <b>102</b> can have a thermal resistance R<sub>jc </sub>of 1&#xb0; C./W to 2&#xb0; C./W. The thermal interface material (TIM) <b>110</b> can have a thermal resistance R of approximately 0.5&#xb0; C./W. Thus, contemporary LED assemblies can have a total thermal resistance of 2.5&#xb0; C./W or more. A thermal resistance of 10&#xb0; C./W is generally considered excessive.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is desirable to reduce the thermal resistance of an LED assembly so as to enhance the efficiency of the LED, thus allowing the use of higher currents. The use of higher currents can facilitate the production of brighter LEDs that are suitable for such applications as flashlights, displays, and general illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is also desirable to reduce the thermal resistance of an LED assembly so as to enhance the efficiency of the phosphors used to change the color of light emitted by the LED dice thereof. Enhancing the efficiency of such phosphors provides more reliable color stability.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>, aspects facilitate the construction of an LED assembly having a more desirable, i.e., lower thermal resistance so as to provide increased brightness and improved color stability.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, LED dice <b>201</b> can be attached directly (without the use of a separate substrate such as substrate <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to a heat sink base <b>202</b>. For example, the LED dice <b>201</b> can be solder bonded to the heat sink base <b>202</b>. The heat sink base <b>202</b> can have a thermal conductivity of greater than 100 W/mK. The heat sink base can comprise copper, aluminum, or steel, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The heat sink base <b>202</b> can be generally circular when viewed from above. Alternatively, the heat sink base <b>202</b> can have any other desired shape. For example, the heat sink base <b>202</b> can be square, pentagonal, octagonal, or oval when view from above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Attachment of the LED dice <b>201</b> directly to the heat sink base <b>202</b> eliminates the resistance to heat flow associated with the substrate <b>102</b> and with the thermal interface material (TIM) <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus, heat from the LED dice <b>201</b> flows more readily into the heat sink base <b>202</b> (as compared to the heat sink base <b>103</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Positive <b>206</b> and negative <b>207</b> leads can cooperate with wire bonds (not shown) to provide current to the LED dice <b>201</b>, as discussed above. The leads can pass through vias <b>220</b> formed in the heat sink base <b>202</b>. The vias <b>220</b> can be plated through such that the leads do not need to pass therethrough. Conductive traces (not shown) can be formed upon the heat sink base <b>202</b> to facilitate the communication of current from the positive <b>206</b> and negative <b>207</b> leads to the LED dice <b>201</b> according to well known principles.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A layer of phosphors <b>212</b> can be formed upon the LED dice <b>201</b> to change the color of light emitted by the LED dice <b>201</b>. Thus, more desirable colors can be provided by the LED assembly. For example, the phosphors <b>212</b> can be used to change the color of light emitted by the LED dice <b>201</b> from blue to a substantially white color.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A lens <b>213</b> can be formed upon or proximate the layer of phosphors <b>212</b> to focus light from the LED dice <b>201</b>. The lens <b>213</b> can comprise silicon. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other materials are also suitable for the formation of the lens <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Through holes or bores <b>221</b> can facilitate the use of fasteners, such as screws or bolts. Such fasteners can be used to attach the heat sink base <b>202</b> to heat sink fins <b>404</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a lump lens <b>308</b> can have a layer of phosphor <b>309</b> formed upon the back side (the side that will be closest to the LED dice <b>201</b> when assembled) thereof. A phosphor layer can similarly be formed upon the front side of the lump lens <b>308</b>. When a phosphor layer is formed upon the lump lens <b>308</b>, then the phosphors <b>212</b> at the LED dice <b>201</b> can be omitted. Any desired combination of phosphors on the back side of lump lens <b>308</b>, on the front side of lump lens <b>308</b>, and upon the heat sink base <b>202</b> can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the heat sink base <b>202</b> can be assembled to a heat sink having heat sink fins. For example, the heat sink base <b>202</b> can be attached to heat sink fins <b>404</b> with fasteners, such as via bolts or screws <b>401</b>. An optional layer of thermal interface material <b>460</b> can be disposed between heat sink base <b>202</b> and heat sink fine <b>404</b>. Alternatively, the heat sink base <b>202</b> can be attached to the heat sink fins via solder <b>460</b> or can be otherwise attached to the heat sink fins <b>404</b>. Thus, layer <b>460</b> can represent either thermal interface material or solder.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The lump lens <b>308</b> can be inserted into the heat sink fins <b>404</b> and retained in place via ring holder <b>409</b>. Ring holder <b>409</b> can be attached to the heat sink fins <b>404</b> via fasteners, such as bolts or screws <b>414</b>. Other methods for attaching the lump lens <b>308</b> to the heat sink fins and/or for attaching the ring holder <b>409</b> to the heat sink fins <b>404</b> are likewise suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">One or more heat pipes <b>450</b> can be formed within or attached to the heat sink fins <b>404</b> to better facility heat flow from the LED die <b>201</b> therethrough. The heat pipe can comprise channels or passages within which a fluid is disposed. The heat pipe can extend from the heat sink fins <b>404</b> into the heat sink base <b>202</b>, if desired. The heat pipe <b>450</b> can be formed integrally with the heat sink, e.g., with the heat sink base <b>202</b> and/or the heat sink fins <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As those skilled in the art will appreciate, a heat pipe is a heat transfer device that moves heat between hotter and colder interfaces thereof. At the hot interface of the heat pipe, the fluid turns into vapor and the vapor flows to the cold interface, where it condenses. The condensed vapor or liquid then travels by capillary action back to the hot interface and the cycle repeats.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a ledge <b>421</b> formed in the heat sink fins <b>404</b> can define a light seal that inhibits the transmission of light (such as blue light when the phosphors layer <b>212</b> is not used) from the LED dice <b>201</b> between the lump lens <b>308</b> and the heat sink fins <b>404</b>. Thus, the use of such a seal can better facilitate the production of a desired color of light by the LED assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">More particularly, the ledge <b>421</b> can be a cut out portion of the heat sink fins <b>404</b> that receives and abuts a periphery of the phosphor layer <b>309</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Light from the LED dice <b>201</b> is inhibited from passing between the phosphor layer <b>309</b> and the heat sink fins <b>404</b> by the ledge <b>421</b>. That is, the ledge <b>421</b> allows the periphery of the phosphor layer <b>309</b> to be positioned within the heat sink fins <b>404</b> so that light from the LED dice <b>201</b> must pass through the phosphor layer <b>309</b> in order to escape the LED assembly. Such construction can prevent blue light from the LED dice <b>201</b> from bypassing the phosphor layer <b>309</b> and thus contributing more blue light than is desired to the output of the LED assembly. In this manner, substantially all of the light from the LED assembly passes through the phosphor layer <b>309</b> such that a desired color of light, e.g., white light, is provided by the LED assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a top view of the LED assembly shows that the LED assembly is generally round in configuration. That is, the heat sink base <b>202</b> and the heat sink fins <b>404</b> are round when viewed from above. However, the LED assembly can be of any desired shape and configuration. For example, the LED assembly can be round, oval, square, rectangular, pentagonal, octagonal, or of any other shape when viewed from above.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The ledge <b>421</b> can be define by making the width of the heat sink fins <b>404</b> greater (as shown by dimension A) proximate the heat sink base <b>202</b> and less (as shown by dimension B) farther from the heat sink base <b>202</b>. Both the heat sink fins <b>404</b> and the ledge <b>421</b> can be generally circular when viewed from above. Alternatively, the heat sink fins <b>404</b> and/or the ledge <b>421</b> can have any other desired shape. For example, the heat sink fins <b>404</b> and/or the ledge <b>421</b> can be square, pentagonal, octagonal, or oval when viewed from above.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The phosphor layer <b>309</b> extends over and along the ledge <b>421</b> such that substantially all of the light from the LED dice <b>201</b> that is emitted by the LED assembly must pass through the phosphor layer <b>309</b>. Thus, substantially no light from the LED dice <b>201</b> leaks past the lens <b>308</b> (and thus past the phosphor layer <b>309</b>), such as between the lens <b>308</b> and the heat sink fins <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The heat sink base <b>202</b>, the heat sink fins <b>404</b>, and the lump lens <b>308</b> can cooperate to define a package for the LED dice <b>201</b>. Although the heat sink fins <b>404</b> are generally associated with dissipating heat from the LED dice <b>201</b> into the ambient air, the heat sink base <b>202</b>, the heat sink fins <b>404</b>, and the lump lens <b>308</b> can all dissipate heat from the LED dice <b>201</b> into the ambient air and thus can all contribute to the cooling of the LED dice <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a method for making an LED assembly according to an aspect is shown. One or more LED dice can be attached directly to a heat sink base (such as heat sink base <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), as indicated in block <b>501</b>. The heat sink base can have a minimum thermal conductivity of approximately 100 W/mK.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A silicone lens (such as silicone lens <b>213</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) can be formed upon the heat sink base, as indicated in block <b>502</b>. The silicone lens can formed so as to generally cover the LED dice.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A phosphor layer (such as phosphor layer <b>309</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) can be formed upon the back side of a lump lens, as indicated in block <b>503</b>. A phosphor layer can be formed upon the back side of the lump lens, upon the front side of the lump lens, upon the heat sink base, and/or at any other desired location.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Heat sink fins (such as heat sink fins <b>404</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) can be attached to the heat sink base with LED, as indicated in block <b>504</b>. Fasteners, such as screws, can facilitate such attachment. Any other desired method for attaching the heat sink fins to the heat sink base with LED can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The lump lens can be attached to the heat sink, as indicated in block <b>505</b>. A thermal interface material (such as a thermal interface material comprises of polymer or solder) can be disposed intermediate the heat sink base and the heat sink fins. The heat sink base and the heat sink fins can cooperate so as to define a heat sink that enhances heat dissipation from the LED dice attached to the heat sink base.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As used herein, the term &#x201c;active area&#x201d; or &#x201c;active region&#x201d; can be defined to include a region in a light-emitting diode where injected electrons and holes recombine to generate photons in the LED when current is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As used herein &#x201c;formed upon&#x201d; can be defined to include deposited, etched, attached, or otherwise prepared or fabricated upon, such as when referring to the forming the various layers.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As used herein &#x201c;on&#x201d; and &#x201c;upon&#x201d; can be defined to include positioned directly or indirectly on or above.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, the term &#x201c;package&#x201d; can be defined to include an assembly of elements that houses one or more LED chips and provides an interface between the LED chip(s) and a power source to the LED chip(s). A package can also provide optical elements for the purpose of directing light generated by the LED chip. Examples of optical elements are lens and reflectors.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As used herein, the term &#x201c;transparent&#x201d; can be defined to include the characterization that no significant obstruction or absorption of electromagnetic radiation occurs at the particular wavelength or wavelengths of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As used herein, the term &#x201c;heat sink&#x201d; can be defined to include any structure that facilitates heat dissipation when heat flows therethrough.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">One or more aspects mitigate the temperature of the junction of an LED. Reducing the temperature of an LED increases the efficiency thereof. The use of higher current is thus facilitated. The use of higher current facilitates the production of brighter LEDs that are better suited for use in applications such as flashlights, displays, and general illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">One or more aspects mitigate the temperature of any phosphors that are used to modify the color of an LED. By keeping the phosphors at a lower temperature, better efficiency of the phosphors is maintained. In this manner, the desired color of light from the LED is more reliably provided.</p>

<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The fundamental breakthrough in green technology are the Varactor Free Amplitude Controlled Oscillator VFACO and the planar EMI-Free Planar Inductor. The VFACO makes the fine tune for oscillation frequency. It has the frequency compensation over temperature. It doesn't have the VCO self-modulation-induced phase noise. It is phase-noiseless. It is high-Q and high stability. It increases the communication capacity. The EMI-Free Planar Inductor is the backbone of the platform of green technology. The platform of green technology contains the Xtaless ClockChip, Inductorless PMU &#x26; PA and ESDS-PCB to provide the green technology for green chip design. Especially for the 4<sup>th </sup>generation wireless communication, the Inductorless PMU &#x26; PA are the most important green technology. The Xtaless ClockChip adopts the most advanced self-compensation Amplitude controller. The ESDS-PCB has the minimum Via assignment algorithm to make the optimum pin assignment for the platform of green technology. The self-compensation Amplitude controller is so powerful that the Xtaless ClockChip is trimless and/or trimfree Xtaless ClockChip. It is plastic-packageable and IP-able Xtaless ClockChip that it is the only market-ready-product Xtaless ClockChip.</p>

No. 7,663,349, and a series of other applications following this prior application which herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Every chip needs the clock and the power supply. Therefore, the green chip platform must include both the clock and power supply. The crystal is a mechanical resonator. It takes a lot of energy to drive the mechanical resonator to oscillate. Furthermore, the size of crystal is too large to integrate into the chip package. Therefore, it is ideal to use the electronic resonator to replace the mechanical resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ideally, the electronic facility should have the better performance than the mechanical facility. Therefore, the electronic resonator should have the better performance than the mechanical resonator. However, for one hundred years, we still use the crystal to be the reference of oscillator. To be miniature, the on-chip MEM was adopted to be the reference. However, after several years of trial, the MEM project almost all fails.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The only survival is the LC resonator. However, the previous approach of the prior art used the frequency controller. It is based on the open-loop free-running oscillator. It suffers the low Q, temperature, humidity and package problem. Since there is no other clock reference. The LC resonance itself is the final reference. It is impossible to measure the frequency deviation to make the frequency correction with feedback control.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, we make the innovation of VFACO Varactor Free Amplitude Controlled Oscillator to be the MS0-GBQ-AMC LCO. MS0 represents the Moisture Sensitivity level is Zero. The clock frequency is independent of the humidity moisture level to be constant. GBQ represents the Gain-Boost Quality factor Q. AMC is the AMplitude Controller. In contrast to the open-loop free-running frequency controller of the prior art, the Amplitude Controller AMC is a closed-loop feedback control. The frequency is function of the amplitude. f=f(A). We can control the amplitude A of the LC resonance to control the frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The planar-inductor design is the key component of the MS0-GBQ-AMC LCO. MS0 is the component/device GBQ is the circuit level. AMC is the system level. With the innovations in component/device level, circuit level and system level, we make the on-chip Xtaless ClockChip dream come true. With the green-technology, our Xtaless ClockChip has the superior performance: (1) Ultra-High Q Clock Performance and EMI-free (a guided magnetic field flux) inductor or transformer: (2) Since the self-compensation that only the 2<sup>nd </sup>order variance is left to be the Trimming-less. As the 2<sup>nd </sup>order is negligible for the low performance clock, it can even be trimming-free to save the cost of test and calibration (3) Plastic-Package-able &#x26; IP-able: (4) Ultra-Low Cost (CMOS compatible): (5) It is the only &#x201c;marketing-ready&#x201d; real clock &#x201c;product&#x201d; design.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The planar-inductor also can apply to the PCB for large power handling capability. The derived products are the versatile sockets and plugs for the green technology. For the safety purpose, the Vialess-ESD-PCB and planar-inductor work together to serve as the platform of the system level green technology. To have the 100% protection for all the signal, each net has to have one via for the ESDS Electrostatic Discharge Switch. There is the requirement to minimize the number of vias. The smart via assignment algorithm is developed to have the global via minimization. Based on our innovative methodology. The algorithm is developed for circular linear placement.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the System-On-Chip SOC technology, all the on-board components are trying to merge into the chip. The components cannot be merged, then new circuits are developed to replace the function of these components. As the component is merged into the chip, it saves power and resource. It meets the requirement and developing trend of the Green Technology.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Every chip needs the power and clock that the clock is the first to be considered merged on-chip. There are many ways to approach this problem. However, all the pioneers still followed the crystal concept that all of them used the MEM to be the reference resonance. However, the MEM approach has many defects of the aging problems, etc. The cost is high. It cannot compete the crystal oscillator, either. Therefore, the MEM approach has died.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">So, the MEM clock companies switches to the LC resonator approach. However, they still use the traditional crystal resonator approach. The crystal resonator is free running. You cannot control the crystal lattice resonation. The prior art of LC resonator uses the free-running methodology, too. Therefore, the prior art put a lot effort to improve the quality Q of the inductor and let the LC resonator open-loop free running. This open-loop free-running methodology is named as the frequency control. However, there is no feedback control at all. The methodology just set the parameters for the temperature, then let the LC resonator to have free running. So, it should be named as the frequency-set instead of the frequency control. Their frequency control is actually not frequency control. There is no such function of freq=f(freq). Frequency is the controlled object. It is wrong to use the frequency to control the frequency itself. Controlling the frequency should be based on the other parameters instead of the frequency itself. Therefore, the traditional frequency controller becomes an open-loop free running. There is only parameter set for the frequency. There is no closed-loop feedback control for the frequency control.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Many people can design LC resonator, however, none of them can design the Xtaless Clock. The design of VFACO Varactor Free Amplitude Controlled Oscillator Xtaless Clock is completely different form the design of Voltage Controlled Oscillator VCO type LC resonator. The prior arts use the conventional Voltage Controlled Oscillator VCO type LC resonator design methodologies to design the Xtaless Clock. The Voltage Controlled Oscillator VCO type LC resonator has the essential self-oscillation-induced phase noise problem. It has no way to use as the LCO of the clock chip. This is the essential disaster problem of the Voltage Controlled Oscillator VCO type LC resonator to serve as the clockchip. However, nobody recognized the disaster problem. It causes the phase noise and the performance is 50 ppm over temperature variation. However, the market requirement is 1 ppm. Therefore, the prior arts of VCO type LC resonator clockchips go nowhere. After many years, the prior arts still fail to recognize the essential characteristics of the Xtaless ClockChip.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The integrated LCOs exhibit a substantially linear negative temperature coefficient (TC). To stabilize the TC, a method of the varactor diode is introduced. The capacitance of the varactor diode has the minor variance during the oscillation of the LC oscillator. The minor variance of the capacitance of the varactor diode will generate the serious Close-To-Carrier phase noise problem. Furthermore, the on-chip inductor has low Q factor. The Q factor has the inverse-square relationship with phase noise. Consequently, it is expected that the close-to-carrier (CTC) phase noise of the LCO will be substantially higher than for a comparable XO. This makes the LCO poorly suited to RF applications due to concern over reciprocal mixing and the associated degradation in receiver sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Even worse, in the prior art, the resonant frequency varies according to the humidity. As the moisture level changes, the LC resonant frequency changes about 600 pans per million PPM between the Florida and Las Vegas. Therefore, they have to use the ceramic package to walk around the problem. However, it only solves the short-term test problem. It doesn't solve the long-term user problem. In the short-term test, changing the humidity of the test chamber, it doesn't see the problem. However, in the long run of the field application, it still shows the frequency drift due to the humidity moisture change. Even using the ceramic package doesn't solve the humidity moisture level problem, either. However, the prior an still doesn't recognize the moisture sensitivity level problem for the Xtaless ClockChip at all.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">What is the difference? the Methodology. In the Elementary School, you use the Arithmetic to solve the problem. In the University, you use the Calculus to solve the same problem. Similarly, the prior art used the undergraduate EE student circuit theory to solve the LC resonator problem. They set the LC parameters and let it free running. They named the set of LC parameters to be frequency control. Actually, there is no control at all. We are able to use the most advanced Circuit and System Design Methodology to solve the LC resonator problem. Why is our approach superior to the prior arts? The simple terms are the &#x201c;Design Methodology&#x201d;. With the most advanced Circuit and System Design Methodology, we use the anti-chaos circuit to control the chaotic LC resonator. However, the prior arts use the idealized LC resonator and the prior arts even don't know the real-life LC resonator has the parametric chaos circuit all. They just have the frequency parameter setting. They don't have the frequency control at all. From the functional relation, the frequency control is freq=f(freq). There is no such kind a function. Therefore, the prior arts actually have the frequency parameter setting. The prior arts don't have the frequency control at all. Actually, there is no such kind frequency control for the LC resonator frequency. This term &#x201c;frequency control&#x201d; for the LC resonator is completely violating the rigorous analytic methodology and philosophy.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The prior art clock chips are not &#x201c;marketing-ready product&#x201d; yet. There is no comparison between the prior Reference-free ClockChip with our Xtaless ClockChip. The prior-art clock chips are not &#x201c;market-ready product&#x201d; yet. The prior-art still have far way to go: they have a lot things to learn.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In our approach, we identify the functional relation of the amplitude controlling the frequency in the LC resonator. Then we controlling the amplitude to fix the frequency. The function relation is freq=f(amplitude). From the fundamental knowledge methodology and design philosophy, this amplitude control is a valid approach. However, the frequency control of the prior art is not a valid approach at all. If the fundamental methodology is not correct, how the prior arts can get the correct results? Therefore, the prior arts used the &#x201c;curve fitting&#x201d; to fit for the test bench calibration results. There are so many parameters varying over such a long time and different environments. The prior art is a hopeless approach. However, the prior arts don't know the fundamental problem is their design methodology and the architecture and system based on the wrong design methodology, not the circuit itself.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, we adopt the green technology platform approach. The Xtaless ClockChip technology can be extended to apply in the inductorless Power Management Unit PMU and the high power efficiency power amplifier. The inductor of the PMU and PA can be implemented with the on-chip planar inductor to be the inductorless PMU and inductorless PA. It saves a lot of energy and resource to be the green chip of the green technology.</p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">Objects and Advantages</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The green technology platform is constituted of the clock and power. The power includes the PMU and PA. The clock is the Xtaless ClockChip and the power is the no on board inductor Inductorless PMU and PA. All the Xtaless ClockChip. Inductorless PA and PMU are based on the planar inductor technology. Furthermore, the Xtaless ClockChip adopting the amplitude controller methodology, the Inductorless PMU adopting the ZVS Zero Voltage Switch methodology and the PA using the recycling-energy to have the high performance of the green chip technology platform.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The amplitude control for the Xtaless ClockChip is the closed-loop feedback control having the self-compensation capability. Even we still use the NVM for trimming of the 2<sup>nd </sup>order effects, it can self-compensate and self-adaptive for the variance of the gain due to the variation of temperature, voltage, aging, etc. With the self-compensation design techniques, only the 2<sup>nd </sup>order variance effect is left that the Xtaless ClockChip is able to be trimming-less or even trimming-free.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The conventional crystal technology is limited to the low frequency. However, the planar inductor can operate at the high frequency that the resonator technology can be extended to the high frequency operation inductorless PMU and inductorless PA to have the complete set of the green technology platform.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Green Technology is very challenge. Shrinking the device size means both the save of the resource and energy. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the thick dark lines enclosed components are the key components of the green technology. The Xtaless clock and Inductorless PMA and PA are the backbone of the green technology platform.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">For the MS0-GBQ-AMC Xtaless clockchip in the green technology, there are three key technologies, the MS0. GBQ and AMC. MS0 is the Moisture Sensitivity zero. The clock frequency is independent of the moisture level. GBQ is the Gain-Boost-Q. With the GBQ technology, the Q of the LC resonator can boost from 4 to 10,000,000. The AMC is the closed-loop feedback controlled Amplitude Controller. With our innovative three key technologies, the Xtaless clockchip will take over all the clock and frequency control market. From the design methodology and system perspective, the amplitude controller is completely different from the conventional frequency controller of the prior-arts.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the undergraduate school basic circuit theory, the LC resonator is treated as the linear circuit to be &#x201c;periodic circuit&#x201d;. The frequency controller of all the prior art is derived from the linear circuit theory. They use the set &#x26; go, open-loop free-running LC resonator approach. They set the parameters for the LC resonators first, then let the LC resonator free to run. In summary, the frequency controller of the prior art is the open-loop free-running methodology for the linear periodic LC resonator circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">With the graduate school nonlinear chaotic theory, we are the first to treat the LC resonator to be the nonlinear &#x201c;chaotic circuit&#x201d;. The nonlinearity comes from the 2<sup>nd </sup>order MOS device. The chaotic circuit is the quasi-periodic with random stochastic behavior which is corresponding to the periodic oscillation with littering of the LC resonator. For the chaotic circuit, we design the anti-chaos feedback-loop amplitude controller to eliminate the chaos from the nonlinear chaotic LC resonator. In summary, the amplitude controller of our innovation is the closed-loop feedback/feedforward-controller methodology for the nonlinear chaotic LC resonator circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The traditional frequency controller of the prior art is based on the wrong design methodology. Actually, there should not have the frequency controller at all. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, it is a LC resonator. The traditional approach is based on the free-running concept. There is the implicit &#x201c;no-touch&#x201d; concept on the LC resonator. Let the LC resonator to be free-running mode. Any control on the LC resonator will interrupt the natural frequency oscillation of the LC resonator. Therefore, set the supply current and set the inductance L and capacitance C, then let the LC resonator go. So, it is the frequency setting, not the frequency controlling.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">It is expected the LC resonator will oscillate at the constant frequency, f=1/(LC)<sup>1/2</sup>. However, as shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the amplitude of the output voltage of the LC resonator is varying and the frequency is varying accordingly. As shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, on the phase plot of the LC resonator, it shows that the free-running naturally resonant LC resonator is a chaotic circuit, not a periodic circuit. The conventional thinking of the LC resonator is a periodic circuit is completely wrong. The chaotic degree is very small that all the people think the LC resonator is a periodic circuit and uses the free-running approach. For the free running mode, it just needs to set the correct L and C value and let it go. It is the frequency setting, not frequency control. This is valid only for the ideal passive resonator having no active devices.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The fundamental philosophy of the amplitude control is to recognize the LC resonator is a low-degree chaotic circuit. We need to develop the anti-chaotic circuit to get rid of the chaos of the LC resonator. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, it shows the frequency being the function of the amplitude. In other words, controlling the amplitude to be a fixed value, we can fix the resonant frequency at a constant frequency. This is the fundamental concept of the amplitude control for real-life active resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">To design the LC resonator correctly, it should use the Nonlinear Chaotic Circuit Theory instead of the linear LC filter theory in the basic Circuit Theory. From the design methodology of the Nonlinear Chaotic Circuit Theory, the famous Tangs Resonance Rule is derived. The Amplitude Controller is based on the Tangs Resonance Rule. The Tangs Resonance Rule is summarized as follows.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">[Tangs Resonance Rule] The chaotic LC resonator has the complex conjugate relation</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(1) resonant imaginary relation fo&#x2dc;1/(LC)<sup>1/2 </sup></p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(2) energy dissipation balanced real relation IV&#x2dc;/CV<sup>2 </sup></p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">where V is the amplitude of the LC resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">(I) From IV&#x2dc;fCV<sup>2</sup>, we get (IN)&#x2dc;fC.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Therefore, for the LC resonator. C decreases, f increases.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">(II) From IV&#x2dc;fCV<sup>2</sup>, we get (I/C)&#x2dc;fV.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">So, for the LC resonator, amplitude V decreases, increases, and vice versa. Therefore, the dissipation term will influence the resonant term as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. This effect is through the nonlinear term as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, the linear LC circuit theory fails to modeling this effect and fails to recognize this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the Amplitude Controller is a system and architecture level LC resonator design. To have the real Xtaless ClockChip product, we have made the three levels technology breakthrough innovations as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">(1) device level&#x2014;planar EMI-free Inductor</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">(2) circuit level&#x2014;GBQ/DGBQ LC</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">(3) system and architecture level&#x2014;Amplitude Controller</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">These three levels must be coupled to work to be the complete working Xtaless ClockChip.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, it is the conventional frequency controller LC resonator in the prior an. It is noted that the polarity of the varactor is completely wrong due to the failure of the Xtaless ClockChip problem. It makes the clock spectrum spreading due to the voltage swing of the oscillation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, at the temperature T<b>0</b>, the LC resonator is oscillates at fo frequency with amplitude A<b>0</b>. As the temperature varies front T<b>0</b> to T<b>1</b>, the frequency increases to bell. To slow down the LC resonator from f<b>1</b> to f<b>0</b>, the control voltage Vctrl is changed to add more capacitance to the LC resonator. The frequency decreases from fl to fo and the amplitude becomes to A<b>2</b>. To have this kind operation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the on-chip temperature sensor TEMP sends the temperature information to ADC. Then the corresponding control voltage information stored in the non-volatile memory and register NVM REG is taken out and sent to DAC to convert to be the analog Vctrl signal to adjust the capacitance variance of the LC resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, for the coarse tune of the frequency, it is done by the digital control of the bank of capacitor array. For the fine tune of the frequency, it is done by the analog control of the varactor diode. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, as the temperature varies, the control voltage Vctrl changes to tune the average capacitance to adapt to the variance of the capacitance due to the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The amplitude-control clock chip is the only clock chip which works for the RF/Wireless product. It doesn't use frequency control varactor that it will not generate the Close To Carrier CTC phase. Furthermore, the Gain-Boost-Q (GBQ) amplitude K common-mode control will increase the Q of the LC resonator a lot that any CTC phase noise will be further suppressed with the GBQ amplitude control.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The fine tune of the oscillatory frequency is done with the amplitude without the varactor diode. There is no CTC phase noise generation. On the contrary, the Gain-Boost-Q amplitude control further suppress the other CTC phase noise. The amplitude control is not only not generating CTC phase noise but also increasing Q to suppress the other CTC phase noise. Therefore, the amplitude control clock chip is the only clock chip which can use in the RF/Wireless/Cellular Phone products.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the conventional frequency controller LC resonator approach, the prior arts just knew the frequency varies as the temperature varies. They don't know why and how the frequency varies. The prior arts just used the test bench curve Fitting trying to reduce the frequency variances with the addition of the capacitance of the varactor. This blind and brute force curve fitting approach is completely wrong.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows how the temperature induces the catastrophic effect on the oscillation frequency of the LC resonator. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, there are the parametric capacitance L(T), C(T), RL(T), RC(T), Cp<b>1</b>(T), Cp<b>2</b>(T), Cn<b>1</b>(T), and Cn<b>2</b>(T). However, there are the most important factors are missing count. It is the bulk diode effect of the MOS devices Mp<b>1</b>, Mp<b>2</b>, Mn<b>1</b> and Mn<b>2</b>. It is the main reason that the LC resonator having the catastrophic frequency variance due to the temperature variation induced the amplitude variation. Because the frequency variance due to the temperature variation induced the amplitude variation is a catastrophic phenomena, all the prior arts failed to recognize the catastrophic mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, as the LC resonator has the large amplitude, the equivalent capacitance of the parametric varactor diode of MOS devices is large. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, as the LC resonator has the small amplitude, the equivalent capacitance of the parametric varactor diode of MOS devices is small. The catastrophic frequency variance due to the temperature variation is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. As the temperature increases, the parametric capacitance Cp<b>1</b>, Cp<b>2</b>, Cn<b>1</b>, Cn<b>2</b> of the LC resonator decreases. The resonant frequency of the LC resonator increases and the resonant amplitude decreases as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, then the equivalent capacitance of the bulk diode of the MOS devices Mp<b>1</b>, Mp<b>2</b>, Mn<b>1</b> and Mn<b>2</b> are reduced further. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, it becomes a catastrophic unstable loop. The catastrophic phenomenon is the frequency higher, the less parametric capacitor; the less parametric capacitor, the frequency higher, etc. Therefore, even with the tiny temperature variation, the catastrophic unstable loop will make the very large capacitance variance. Therefore, with the amplitude controller, we can break the catastrophic unstable loop.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the amplitude controller controls the bulk connections of the MOS devices Mp<b>1</b>, Mp<b>2</b>, Mn<b>1</b> and Mn<b>2</b>. The bulk nodes of the gm-amplifier is controlled by the output of the amplitude controller. A Green Technology Platform apparatus comprises a magnetic-electric resonator accommodating to generate a plurality of clock signals having a resonant frequency. A gm-amplifier is coupled to the magnetic-electric resonator and an oscillator controller is coupled to the magnetic-electric resonator and gm-amplifier means. The oscillator controller is adapted to generate a plurality of outputs to control a plurality of bulk nodes of the gm-amplifier. Furthermore, a plurality of outputs are correlated with temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">To make the LCO circuit analysis and design, we need to build the correct model first. However, there is no model for the LCO which includes the effects of the temperature change, amplitude change, gain change and frequency, etc. Being similar to the PLL, for the conventional LCO design, there are the coarse control of the frequency and fine control of the frequency. The LCO has the capacitor bank for the set of the coarse frequency and the LCO uses the varactor diode bank for the fine tune of the capacitor to compensate the temperature variance.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In our innovation, to avoid the CTC problem, we don't use the varactor diode to compensate the temperature induced capacitance variance. Furthermore, we try to completely eliminate the parametric varactor diode effect of Mp<b>1</b>, Mp<b>2</b>, Mn<b>1</b> and Mn<b>2</b> that we have the Parametric Varactor Compensation as shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6H</figref>. The frequency controller is an isolated controller. The frequency controller sends the varactor diode controlling bits to switch on or off the varactor diode of the LCO. The LCO is free-running. There is no feedback control for the frequency control.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The amplitude controller sends the amplitude control bits to the amplitude control register and send the common-mode control bit to the common-mode control register. The amplitude DAC will convert the amplitude control bits to the amplitude voltage; the common-mode DAC will convert the common-mode control bits to the common-mode voltage. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the amplitude control feedback control amplifier and common-mode feedback control amplifier make the comparisons between the LCO amplitude and common-mode voltage to set the LCO to oscillate at the specified amplitude to have the specified frequency to compensate the capacitance variance due to the temperature variance. The amplitude control is very complicate feedback control loop.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">So, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the frequency control of the LCO is very simple isolated controller having the open-loop free-running oscillation. The frequency control can be completely decoupled from the LCO resonator. So, in the drawing, the frequency controller doesn't include the LCO model. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the amplitude control of the LCO is very complicated coupling controller having the closed-loop feedback controlled oscillation. The amplitude control cannot be decoupled from the LCO resonator.

It comes from the PLL circuit design. It cannot use in the Xtaless ClockChip design. It makes the Xtaless ClockChip is unstable over temperature variance. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is to show the innovation of Varactor Free Amplitude Controlled Oscillator (VFACO) self-compensate varactor topology to compensate for frequency shift due to the bulk capacitance variation in the Varactor Free Amplitude Controlled Oscillator (VFACO) LC oscillation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the spectrum of the idealized LC resonator is a &#x3b4; function at frequency fo. Even with the inductor L having the parametric resistance R<sub>L </sub>and the capacitor C having the parametric resistance R<sub>C</sub>, it still has the idealized delta function spectrum due to the compensation with the positive resistance of the active device. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the spectrum of the real-life LC resonator has the Lorentz function distribution. The prior art and a lot of people have the wrong concept that they think it is due to the resistances R<sub>L </sub>and R<sub>C</sub>. Nobody recognizes the problem being due to the parametric bulk diode effect of the active devices. It is the frequency-tuning effect due to the variance of the varactor capacitance being caused by the voltage-swing. The capacitance of bulk diode varies as the voltage Vo+ and Vo&#x2212; swing. The frequency fo is only the weighted average of the capacitor. The variance of the capacitance of the bulk diode causes the fine modulation of the frequency. Even worse, the variance of the capacitance of bulk diode is anti-symmetric. During the variance of Vo+ and Vo&#x2212;, one side of varactor is more forward bias and the junction capacitance increases. On the other side is more reverse biased and the junction capacitance decreases, and vice versa. Therefore, the capacitor loading at the two node Vo+ and Vo&#x2212; are not the same and varies. Therefore, the oscillation curve is distorted and the frequency drifts. To eliminate the frequency drift. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> is the spectrum of the LC resonator having the self-compensation bulk diode capacitance for the voltage swing.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0116">With the above self-compensation techniques and the self-adaptive capability of the amplitude control, only the 2<sup>nd </sup>order effects are left. It is not necessary to trim for the 2<sup>nd </sup>order effect to be the trimless/trimfree Xtaless ClockChip. It is noted that in the amplitude control, we use the active NMOS devices Mn<b>1</b>, Mn<b>2</b> and PMOS devices Mp<b>1</b>, Mp<b>2</b> as the bulk diode directly. We don't need the extra varactor diode as the prior art does. Furthermore, for the differential bulk diode and differential diode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the amplitude reference is related to temperature. LCO has the amplitude and common mode voltage controlled by the amplitude controller to compensate the temperature variation of the LCO. It is noted that the self-compensation bulk diode in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> has both the voltage compensation and temperature compensation effects. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6H</figref>, the compensate bulk diodes are the sum of the active device and the buffer. The bulk of the buffer is biased by the control voltages ctrlp and ctrln, too.

<p id="p-0114" num="0117">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the Varactor Free Amplitude Controlled Oscillator (VFACO) amplitude controller has several applications in the control of the LC resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0118">(1) As the Varactor Free Amplitude Controlled Oscillator (VFACO) amplitude control voltages ctrlp, ctrln, vcom, gcom and the oscillation amplitude are fixed, there is no variation of the capacitance of the parametric bulk diode.

<p id="p-0116" num="0119">The varactor diode of the prior art is added to compensate the capacitance variance due to the catastrophic unstable loop. There is no need for the additional varactor diode at all. The addition of the varactor diode comes from the VCO of the PLL. However, the VCO of the Xtaless ClockChip is not the VCO of PLL. It is wrong to take the VCO of the PLL design to the VCO of the Xtaless ClockChip without the knowledge of the difference of the VCO of the PLL and the VCO of the Xtaless ClockChip.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0120">(2) Controlling the biasing voltages of ctrlp and ctrln, the MOS devices Mp<b>1</b>, Mp<b>2</b>, Mn<b>1</b> and Mn<b>2</b> can serve as the bulk diode. We don't need the extra varactor diode at all.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0121">(3) As the temperature varying, we can make the minor modifications for the controlling voltages of ctrlp and ctrln to compensate the 2<sup>nd </sup>order variation of the LC tank.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0122">It is very important to know that the Varactor Free Amplitude Controlled Oscillator (VFACO) amplitude controller LC resonator has the 1<sup>st </sup>order self-compensation to have the self-adaptive capabilities to the variance of the environment. The trimming or calibration is only for the 2<sup>nd </sup>order effect. All the 1<sup>st </sup>effect has been cancelled in the 1<sup>st </sup>order self-compensation and self-adaptive process of the amplitude controller LC resonator. Therefore, as we design the Varactor Free Amplitude Controlled Oscillator (VFACO) LC resonator, we need to design for the 1<sup>st </sup>order self-compensation with the amplitude controller. Then use the trimming to correct the 2<sup>nd </sup>order effect. A lot of times, the 2<sup>nd </sup>order is so minor that it is no need to trimming. It is the trimming-free Xtaless ClockChip.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0123">The design Target/Object Oriented is Self-Adaptive to cancel all the 1<sup>st </sup>order effects. The order self-compensation design techniques for the amplitude controller LC resonator are as follows.</p>

<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(2) The LC variance due to the temperature is self-compensated as follow.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0125">Why we need to have the amplitude controller to keep the constant amplitude? For the same voltage level of amplitude, the increment of the inductor length is &#x394;T. Therefore, the decrease of current is proportional to &#x394;T. The area of the inductor increase is about (&#x394;T)<sup>2</sup>. So the net increment of the inductance is (&#x394;T)<sup>2</sup>/&#x394;T=&#x394;T. So, the (&#x394;L/L)&#x2dc;(&#x394;T/T). For the capacitance, as the temperature increase, the insulate layer increases. Therefore, the decrease of the capacitance is proportional to &#x394;T. This capacitor temperature effect (&#x2212;&#x394;C/C)&#x2dc;(&#x394;T/T) is applied to both the MOS capacitor and the main capacitance C.</p>

<p id="p-0129" num="0132">Even worse, the conventional frequency controller of the prior art never mentions how to handle the variance of the humidity on the moisture sensitivity level. In the prior arts, they just used the ceramic package to walk around the short term test problem. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the plastic package has the short transient time. In the test burner, changing the humidity from the Florida to the Las Vegas, there is 600 parts per million PPM frequency shift in the test period. Therefore, the prior art uses the ceramic package having the long-term transient constant to walk the test problem. In the short test period, the ceramic package cannot test the change of the frequency. However, in the real life application, for the ceramic package, the moisture sensitivity problem still comes out. It is the most serious problem of the prior art of the Xtaless ClockChip. However, all the prior arts fails to recognize this humidity problem and stay away from this problem. Therefore, none of the prior art is the product ready Xtaless ClockChip.

Increasing the capacitance of the varactor diode with the varying of the control voltage Vctrl. Then the LC resonator will oscillate at the frequency f<sub>o </sub>with amplitude A<b>1</b>. It is well-known the variance amplitude will change the resonance of the LC resonator. Actually, the variance amplitude changes the equivalent capacitance of the LC resonator. The mutual influence of the amplitude and the capacitance of the LC resonator make the trimming of the frequency control become intractable. Furthermore, this process has to repeat for all the parameters. However, even worse, it is not N arrays parameters for aging, temperature, process, etc. It is the multi-dimensional arrays of aging, temperature, process, etc. It is (N*N*N . . . ) arrays.

<p id="p-0140" num="0143">Furthermore, there is the power and clock P&#x26;C management. There are the spread spectrum and the power and clock management to control the oscillation frequency of the LC resonator. As the power saving mode and the clock needs to slow down, the resonant frequency of the LC resonator is reduced. For the Xtaless Clock Chip there is two ways to make the P&#x26;C management. One way is to use the 1<sup>2</sup>C bus and the other way is to use the Clock pin. In case the other chip or system doesn't have the I<sup>2</sup>C bus, the only way is to use the Xtaless Chip clock pin. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is the power and clock P&#x26;C protocol, system and circuit design for the power and clock P&#x26;C management with the Scalable Single End Multiple Level PMU.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0144">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, it is our novel innovation of the Scalable Single End Multiple Level P&#x26;C protocol. It can support any kinds chip interface with the clock interface. For the Xtaless Clock chip, there is only the power pin, ground pin and clock pin. The interface is compatible with the existed 2-pin crystal oscillator which has the XI and XO two pins. The Xtaless clock pin is connected with the XO pin of the traditional crystal clock. There is no need to add the extra pin to the Xtaless Clock chip just for the traditional crystal clock power management interface.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0145">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the other chip just needs to pull down or pull up the clock pin, then the Xtaless Chip can detect the pull-down and pull-up to change the P&#x26;C status. For the P&#x26;G management, there are the normal, doze, standby, suspend, etc state. For the CLKO, there are three states, tri-state, pull up and pull down. As the CLKO input of the other chip is in the tri-state, the P&#x26;G state stays in the original state. As the CLKO input of the other chip is in the pull down state, the P&#x26;G state moves down one state: as the CLKO input of the other chip is in the pull up state, the P&#x26;G state moves up one state, or vice versa. As the clock pin is pulled down, the P&#x26;C state can change from the normal to doze, standby, suspend, etc state. In other words, as the clock pin is pulled up, the P&#x26;C state can chance from the suspend, standby, doze, to etc states back to normal state. The state transition can be in sequence or in one-time of bi-state operation if the pull-up or pull-down is held for many clock cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref> shows the detailed signal flow block diagram for the P&#x26;C management. This P&#x26;C management can be applied to any kind resonator. Here, we just use our innovative Amplitude Controller Xtaless ClockChip as an illustrative example. The single direction clock signal pin CLKO is served as the bi-directional signal net in the P&#x26;C management. During the clock transmission, the other chip pulls up or pulls down the CLKO net, the voltage level, slew rate of the clock edge and the duty cycle will vary. The P&#x26;C Clock Sensor detects any variance of the voltage level, slew rate of the clock edge or the ditty cycle, it can determine it is tri-state, pull-up state or pull-down state. Either pull-up state or pull-down state, the state transition will transfer to the P&#x26;C control. After several cycles, if the state does not come back to the tri-state, then it is presume that this is the bi-state operation or just issues another same state transition command to move state continuously.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0147">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>, as the P&#x26;C controller receives the state transition command, the P&#x26;C Controller identify the correct P&#x26;G state memory in the NVM memory to load into the amplitude controller AC Register. Depending on the amplitude controller and oscillator design, the amplitude controller issues the amplitude controlling, bulk diode and capacitance controlling commands to the resonator. For example, the amplitude controller issues the amplitude controlling commands to control the vcom and gcom of the LC resonator; the amplitude controller issues the bulk diode or capacitance controlling commands to control the ctrlp, ctrln to control the capacitance of LC resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0148">To reduce the power dissipation, it needs to reduce the current flowing into the LC resonator. However, for the conventional frequency controller LC resonator, reducing the current, the frequency will increase instead of decreasing. The prior arts doesn't understand the reason that the prior arts add the extra redundant varactor diode to compensate the frequency shift effect. For the amplitude controller, we don't need to add the extra redundant varactor diode. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref>, we can change the substrate bias voltages ctrlp and min to shift the operating point to high capacitance range. So, even the power injecting the LC resonator is reduced, the frequency still can keep the same or even lower. If the clock frequency is needed to be reduced furthermore, as shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>, the divide ratio in the Divider or PLL can be changed to reduce the clock frequency in the P&#x26;C management.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0149">In the test process, we need the fast scanning and decision capability. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows the fast calibration for the LC resonator. The LC resonator is compared with the CLK_ref. First, the initial value is loaded into the register. Then start the counter. As the counter difference is large than 2, the counter is reset and the register value is increases or decreases depending on which counter has the larger value. As the counter value is larger than a large value, say 1000, the test is passed and the register value is stored back to the non-volatile memory NVM.</p>

Based on the (circular) linear interval graph, the minimum via assignment with the maximum planarity algorithm can be derived. It is noted that the (circular) linear interval graph is the split can dependent. However, with two different linear interval graphs corresponding to different split cuts, finding the minimum reduced Tangs distance to be the distance, we can complete cover all the versatile conditions to be the complete circular graph.

<p id="p-0191" num="0194">The Xtaless ClockChip is not only a clock chip but also it has very important system applications. Here we use two examples. USB-3 and tire safety, to illustrate the powerful applications of the Xtaless ClockChip technology. USB3 is the SERDES working at 5 GHz. Traditional approach needs to use the 25 MHz crystal oscillator and PLL to boost up the frequency 200 times to be 5 GHz. It takes a lot resources and the performance is poor. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</figref>, we invent the 3SGLL-USB3. It has the hierarchical clock &#x26; data structure of the Global Frequency Layer and the Local Phase Delay Layer in the signal propagation. In contrast to the prior art, all the VCOs in the PLL are replaced with the Xtaless Clocks. There is the delay line to match the difference in phase. However, all the Xtaless Clocks are synchronized to be the same frequency. During power up, all the Xtaless Clocks are automatically run at the set up frequency without synchronization. As the data starts to transmit, then the Xtaless Clocks start to synchronize with each other. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58D</figref>, the generic 3SGLL-USB3 has the DLL loop for the phase matching among the clock and the PLL loop for the synchronize of the frequency. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58E</figref>, the advanced implementation of the 3SGLL-USB3 has phase loop for the phase matching and the frequency loop for the frequency synchronization. The frequency synchronization adopts the early/late CDR algorithm as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58C</figref>. It has the accumulation count effect to have the fine tune of the frequency of the Xtaless Clocks. There are many different versions of the early/late detecting methodologies. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58C</figref>, if the sampled data at 90 degrees position is different from the sampled data at 0+d position or the sampled data at 270 degrees position is different from the sampled data at 180+d position, the Xtaless Clock is early. If the sampled data at 90 degrees position is different from the sampled data at 180&#x2212;d position or the sampled data at 270 degrees position is different from the sampled data at 0&#x2212;d position, the Xtaless Clock is late. If both early and late, the Xtaless Clock frequency is higher than the input data, reduce the Xtaless Clock frequency a little bit, etc. The Xtaless Clock serves the clock for both transmitter and receiver. With this approach, all the Xtaless Clocks in the USB system are synchronized together to be the same frequency. It is noted that the DLL loop in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58E</figref> being optional. The input data Din feeds to the Din_direct signal line directly without the DLL, the 3SGLL-USB3 CDR still works greatly. Furthermore, there are many different versions to implement the frequency loop. It can be traditional LPF or the digital late/early, etc. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58E</figref>, changing the LPF to be the early/late digital frequency-locking loop, the 3SGLL-USB3 CDR is a SERDES having no PLL at all. With the self-automation to be the target frequency capability, the Xtaless Clock can automatically runs at the target frequency such as the 5 GHz for the 3SGLL-USB3.

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">When a vehicle door locking operation is conducted, an in-vehicle device checks the vehicle compartment to determine whether a mobile unit exists in the vehicle compartment. When the in-vehicle device receives a response from the mobile unit indicating its presence in the compartment, the in-vehicle device receives a response from the mobile unit, prohibits the door from locking, and activates a buzzer. The mobile unit thus can be prevented from being locked in the vehicle compartment. When the mobile unit receives the search signal, it sounds its buzzer, thereby making it possible to further indicate its location within the compartment.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application relates to and incorporates herein by reference Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-354096 filed on Dec. 28, 2006.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electronic key system and method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional electronic key system for a vehicle is made up of an in-vehicle device that is mounted in a vehicle, and a mobile unit that is carried by a user of the vehicle. This electronic key system executes the control of the lock/unlock of doors or engine starting when authentication of the mobile unit is approved via radio communication between the in-vehicle device and the mobile unit, even if a mechanical key is not operated.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the mobile unit of this electronic key system is lost, it is not easy to find the mobile unit. Therefore, JP 2005-220728A proposes a mobile unit locating device that is used when the user wants to locate the missing mobile unit. However, even when this mobile unit locating device is used, it is not frequently found at what specific location the mobile unit is at although it is possible to roughly know a certain area in which the mobile unit exists.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More specifically, for example, when the mobile unit is placed in a pocket of clothing or in a bag of a user, even if the area in which the mobile unit exists can be specified by using the mobile unit locating device, the user cannot sometimes find where the mobile unit exists within the area. In this case, when there are a lot of possible locations in which the mobile unit may be placed, user must search all those locations for the mobile unit, and therefore cannot find the mobile unit easily. Also, for example, when the mobile unit is lost outdoors at night, even if the area in which the mobile unit exists can be specified by using the mobile unit locating device, where the mobile unit is located cannot be found in a dark location with no light.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an electronic key system and method which can more readily locate a mobile unit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the present exemplary embodiment, an electronic key system and method controls a door of a control object such as a vehicle. In this system and method, an in-object device provided in the control object communicates with a mobile unit carried by a user thereby to conduct an authentication of the mobile unit. When the mobile unit is authenticated, predetermined controls on the door of the control object by the mobile unit are allowed. The in-object device transmits a search signal from the in-object device for locating the mobile unit. When the mobile unit receives the search signal, it issues a notification indicating its existence.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an electronic key system includes an in-vehicle device <b>1</b> that is mounted in a vehicle, and a mobile unit <b>2</b> carried by a user of the vehicle. This electronic key system may have both a smart entry function of executing the control of unlocking of doors when the mobile unit <b>2</b> that is carried by the user enters a radio communication area around the vehicle, and a remote keyless entry function of executing the control of locking or unlocking the doors according to a button operation of the mobile unit by the user at a place away from the vehicle. Both the smart entry function and the remote keyless entry function are known well in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The in-vehicle device <b>1</b> includes a microcomputer <b>10</b>, a low frequency (LF) transmitter unit <b>11</b>, an ultra-high frequency (UHF) receiver unit <b>12</b>, an engine switch <b>15</b>, door antennas <b>16</b> provided on each door of the vehicle, a vehicle in-room antenna <b>17</b> provided in a passenger compartment, an in-trunk antenna <b>18</b> provided inside a trunk, and an out-trunk antenna <b>19</b> provided outside the trunk.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The LF transmitter unit <b>11</b> is means (first transmitter) for transmitting a radio signal to the mobile unit <b>2</b> by electric waves of an LF band (first frequency band). The radio signal that is transmitted from the LF transmitter unit <b>11</b> reaches the respectively limited communication areas through the door antennas <b>16</b>, the in-room antenna <b>17</b>, the in-room antenna <b>18</b>, and the out-trunk antenna <b>19</b>. The UHF receiver unit <b>12</b> is means for receiving a radio signal that are transmitted from the mobile unit <b>2</b> by electric waves of a UHF band (second frequency band).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The engine switch <b>15</b> is operable by the user to start an engine. When an operation of the engine switch <b>15</b> by the user is detected by a signal from the engine switch <b>15</b>, the microcomputer <b>10</b> checks whether engine starting is allowed or not. When the engine starting is allowed, an engine start signal is transmitted from the microcomputer <b>10</b> to an engine control system (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The mobile unit <b>2</b> has a control IC <b>20</b>, an LF receiver unit <b>21</b>, a UHF transmitter unit <b>22</b>, push switches <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, a display unit <b>27</b>, and a buzzer <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The LF receiver unit <b>21</b> is means (first receiver) for receiving the radio signal that is transmitted from the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> by the electric waves of the LF band. The UHF transmitter unit <b>22</b> is means (first transmitter) for transmitting a radio signal to the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> by the electric waves of the UHF band.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The push switches <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are provided as keys that are triggers for mainly using the remote keyless entry function. In the case of conducting one-push operation, the push switch <b>25</b> locks the doors whereas the push switch <b>26</b> unlocks the doors.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The display unit <b>27</b> is made up of an LCD and an LED. When the mobile unit <b>2</b> is located, the display unit <b>27</b> is activated to blink the LED in the mobile unit <b>2</b> to notify the presence of the mobile unit <b>2</b> by means of light. The buzzer <b>28</b> blows to notify the presence of the mobile unit by means of sound. That is, both of the display unit <b>27</b> and the buzzer <b>28</b> are provided as notifying means.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For executing the smart entry function, respective portions of in-vehicle device <b>1</b> are operated while being controlled by microcomputer <b>10</b>, and LF transmitter unit <b>11</b> periodically transmits a transmission request signal under control of microcomputer <b>10</b>. Respective portions of mobile unit <b>2</b> are operated while being controlled by control IC <b>20</b>. When mobile unit <b>2</b> enters either one of the radio communication areas of antennas <b>16</b> to <b>19</b> that can receive the transmission request signal from the LF transmitter unit <b>11</b>, receiver unit <b>21</b> receives the transmission request signal.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A signal transmission using the electric waves of the LF band is conducted between the LF transmitter unit <b>11</b> and the LF receiver unit <b>21</b>. This is because the detection area of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is limited to inside of and the outside periphery of the vehicle. In particular, when the signals are transmitted from the door antennas <b>16</b>, the vehicle in-room antenna <b>17</b>, the in-trunk antenna <b>18</b>, and the out-trunk antenna <b>19</b>, the detection area can be limited to the vicinity of the doors, the vehicle compartment, inside the trunk, and outside the trunk. As a result, it is possible to detect where the mobile unit <b>2</b> exists, and to prevent the mobile unit <b>2</b> from being locked in, for example, when the mobile unit <b>2</b> is left in the compartment or trunk.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the LF receiver unit <b>21</b> receives the transmission request signal from the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, the UHF transmitter unit <b>22</b> transmits a response signal including an identification code (ID) specific to the vehicle corresponding to the mobile unit <b>2</b>. Then, at the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, the UHF receiver unit <b>12</b> receives the response signal from the mobile unit <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A signal transmission using the electric waves of the UHF band is conducted between the UHF transmitter unit <b>22</b> and the UHF receiver unit <b>12</b>. This is because a predetermined communication distance is obtained even if the output level of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is relatively small, and the response signal can be more surely transmitted to the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the UHF receiver unit <b>12</b> receives the response signal from the mobile unit <b>2</b>, the microcomputer <b>10</b> at the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> checks whether the ID included in the response signal agrees with the ID that is stored in the microcomputer <b>10</b> or not, for authentication. When both Ids agree, the unlocking of the doors is allowed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the subsequent process, a known control in the electronic key system of this type is executed. For example, when it is detected that the user or somebody else touched a door knob according to a signal from a touch sensor (not shown) which is disposed in the door knob outside of a driver's door in an unlocking enabled state, the microcomputer <b>10</b> transmits an unlock signal to a door control system. As a result, a door lock motor (not shown) is driven so that all of the doors are unlocked. In addition, other controls may be conducted such that the engine starting is enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The in-vehicle device <b>1</b> executes a mobile unit locating operation in a manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. First, a search process that is executed in the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> will be described with reference to a flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This process is executed with the locking operation of the vehicle which is conducted by the user as a trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the search process starts, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> first executes vehicle compartment checking (step (S) <b>101</b>). In the process of S<b>101</b>, a confirmation signal for confirming or checking whether the mobile unit <b>2</b> exists in the compartment or not is transmitted from the in-room antenna <b>17</b> and the in-trunk antenna <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Subsequently, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> checks whether a response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> or not (S<b>103</b>). In this example, when the response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> (Yes in S<b>103</b>), the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> transmits a search signal (S<b>105</b>). In the process of S<b>105</b>, the search signal for searching or locating the mobile unit <b>2</b> is transmitted from the vehicle in-room antenna <b>17</b> or the in-trunk antenna <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Then, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> instructs a locking inhibition to the door control system, and brings a buzzer (not shown) disposed in the vehicle into a blowing state for a given period of time (for example, 10 seconds) (S<b>107</b>), and completes the locating process.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the other hand, in the process of S<b>103</b>, when no response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> (No in S<b>103</b>), the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> allows and instructs door locking by the door control system (S<b>109</b>), and completes the locating process. As a result, the locking control is conducted by the door control system, and for example, the door lock motor (not shown) is driven to bring all of the doors in the unlocked state.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the process of S<b>101</b>, the vehicle compartment checking is merely conducted without particularly clearly distinguishing the vehicle compartment and the trunk compartment from each other in the above description. Alternatively, the vehicle compartment checking and the trunk compartment checking may be executed at the same time without clearly distinguishing those checkings from each other, or may be sequentially executed with clearly distinguishing those checkings from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also, in the process of S<b>101</b> to S<b>103</b>, it is unnecessary to determine whether the response is received or not, according to only one confirmation signal transmission. For example, when no response is received by one confirmation signal transmission, the transmission of the confirmation signal is again repeated. When no response is received even if a predetermined number of confirmation signal transmissions are repeated, a negative determination may be conducted in the process of S<b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Also, waiting may be conducted until the response is received even if no response is received until a given period of time has elapsed. Then, the determination may be conducted as no response unless the response is received at a time when a given period has elapsed. Likewise, this is applied to a case in which the transmission and determination of the confirmation signal is repeated by a given number of times.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the above locating process is executed by the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, and the confirmation signal that has been transmitted in the process of S<b>101</b> reaches the mobile unit <b>2</b>, a response process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is executed in the mobile unit <b>2</b> with the reception of the confirmation signal as a trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">That is, when the response process starts, the mobile unit <b>2</b> transmits the response to the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> (S<b>201</b>), and completes the response process. When the response that is transmitted in the process of S<b>201</b> is received by the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, the affirmative determination (Yes) is made in the above process of S<b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the search signal that has been transmitted in the process of S<b>105</b> reaches the mobile unit <b>2</b>, the notifying process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is executed in the mobile unit <b>2</b> with the reception of the search signal as a trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">That is, when the notifying process starts, the mobile unit <b>2</b> first checks whether an ID that is included in the received search signal agrees with an ID of the mobile unit <b>2</b> which has been registered in a nonvolatile memory that is incorporated into the control IC <b>20</b> or not (S<b>301</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When those IDs do not agree with each other (No) In the process of S<b>301</b>, the mobile unit <b>2</b> can determine that the mobile unit <b>2</b> is not to be located or searched, and therefore completes the notifying process. On the other hand, when those IDs agree with each other (Yes) in the process of S<b>301</b>, the mobile unit <b>2</b> activate the buzzer <b>28</b> into a blowing state and the LED into a blink lighting state for a given period of time (for example, 10 seconds) (S<b>303</b>) so that it may be easily recognized by the user, and completes the notifying process.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the above embodiment, when the search signal for locating the mobile unit <b>2</b> is transmitted from the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> to the mobile unit <b>2</b>, the display unit <b>27</b> or the buzzer <b>28</b> which are provided in the mobile unit <b>2</b> operate, and indicates that the mobile unit <b>2</b> exists by issuing sound and light as a notification of its reception of the search signal and its existence. Accordingly, even if the mobile unit <b>2</b> is placed in a pocket of clothing or a bag which is located in the compartment of the vehicle, the user can easily find out the mobile unit <b>2</b> by means of sound that is issued by the buzzer <b>28</b>. Also, the user can easily find out the mobile unit <b>2</b> by means of light that is emitted by the display unit <b>27</b> even in a state where the vehicle compartment is dark, for example, in the night.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Also, since the mobile unit <b>2</b> is located by the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> that is mounted in the vehicle, a dedicated mobile unit locating device is not required. Also, unlike a compact mobile unit locating device, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> does not suffer from such drawbacks that the user does not tuck the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> in some place, and also does not forget the place in which the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> is tucked.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the above electronic key system checks whether the mobile unit <b>2</b> is confined in the vehicle compartment or not, when the locking operation is conducted in the vehicle. When the electronic key system detects that the mobile unit <b>2</b> is confined in the vehicle compartment, the system executes the locating of the mobile unit <b>2</b> in association with that detection. Accordingly, not only the mobile unit <b>2</b> is prevented from being confined in the vehicle compartment, but also the mobile unit <b>2</b> that disables the locking operation can be easily found out by the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a second embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the electronic key system includes the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> that is mounted in the vehicle, and the mobile unit <b>2</b>. In addition to the configuration of the first embodiment, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> is configured to be able to conduct data communication with a management server <b>33</b>, and communicate with a cell phone <b>34</b> via the management server <b>33</b>. Further, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> includes a UHF transmitter unit (second transmitter) <b>41</b> and public phone line connecting unit <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The UHF transmitter unit <b>41</b> is disposed to transmit the search signal to the mobile unit <b>2</b> when the mobile unit <b>2</b> is located. The UHF transmitter unit <b>41</b> is not alternative means of the LF transmitter unit <b>11</b>, but both of the LF transmitter unit <b>11</b> and the UHF transmitter unit <b>41</b> function as means for transmitting the search signal to the mobile unit <b>2</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The public line connecting unit <b>43</b> is a device corresponding to a telephone, which is so designed as to be connected to a public line (telephone network) via a base station having a radio communication facility to call another telephone or conduct data communication with another device via the telephone network.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, the use of the public line connecting unit <b>43</b> makes it possible to make a phone communication with a help desk when a trouble occurs in the vehicle. Also, in a process described later, the public line communication connecting unit <b>43</b> is used in the case of conducting the data communication with the management server <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition to the configuration of the first embodiment, the mobile unit <b>2</b> has a UHF receiver unit (second receiver) <b>45</b> and a transmit/receive changeover switch <b>47</b>. The UHF receiver unit <b>45</b> is so disposed as to receive the search signal that is transmitted to the mobile unit <b>2</b> when the mobile unit <b>2</b> is located in the vehicle. As described above, in this embodiment, the search signal is transmitted from both of the LF transmitter unit <b>11</b> and the UHF transmitter unit <b>41</b>. Both of the LF receiver unit <b>21</b> and the UHF receiver unit <b>45</b> function as means for receiving the search signal at the mobile unit <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The transmit/receive changeover switch <b>47</b> is a switch that conducts changeover control by means of the control IC <b>20</b>. The transmit/receive changeover switch <b>47</b> changes over whether the transmission is conducted by the UHF transmitter unit <b>22</b>, or the reception is conducted by the UHF receiver unit <b>45</b>. In this embodiment, there is applied a configuration in which the transmit/receive changeover switch <b>47</b> changes over the transmission or reception to conduct a half-duplex communication. However, as long as the transmission and reception is possible, another configuration may be employed. For example, the transmit/receive changeover switch <b>47</b> is replaced with a circulator, thereby conducting transmission or reception by full duplex communication.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the management server <b>33</b> has a function of conducting a data communication with the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> (public line connecting unit <b>43</b>) or the cell phone <b>34</b> via the public line. Also, the cell phone <b>34</b> has a function of conducting data communication with the management server <b>33</b> via the public line.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Data of the format that complies with the unique standard of the present electronic key system is transmitted or received between the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> and the management server <b>33</b> according to the communication protocol that is defined by that standard. This is because the data format or the communication protocol is not particularly defined when necessary information can be mutually transmitted at the time of communicating with the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, and therefore countermeasures such as conversion of data into e-mail format is unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">On the other hand, data of the e-mail format is transmitted or received between the management server <b>33</b> and the cell phone <b>34</b>. This is because the data format or the communication protocol which complies with the standard of the cell phone <b>34</b> is used at the time of communicating with the cell phone <b>34</b>, and also the data must be converted into formation of the type which can be provided to the user through the user interface at the cell phone <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The electronic key system performs a mobile unit locating operation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">First, a search process that is executed in the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> which is a locating side will be described with reference to a flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This search process is executed when the user conducts the operation on the cell phone <b>34</b> to instruct the locating of the mobile unit <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For this purpose, a mobile unit locating application program is stored in the cell phone <b>34</b>. When the application program has been registered in the cell phone <b>34</b>, information necessary for communication with the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> or the management server <b>33</b> is input by the user, and registered in a nonvolatile memory that is equipped in the cell phone <b>34</b>. Also, a part of the information is also transmitted to the management server <b>33</b> and the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, and then registered in a memory unit disposed in the management server <b>33</b> and the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the user starts the mobile unit locating application program and conducts the operation for instructing the locating of the mobile unit <b>2</b> in the cell phone <b>34</b>, an electronic mail that describes necessary information in a given form is produced by the function of the application program, and the electronic mail is transmitted to the management server <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The management server <b>33</b> analyzes the information that has been described in the electronic mail with the reception of the electronic mail as a turning point to produce data for instructing the locating of the mobile unit <b>2</b> to the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>. Then, that data is transmitted to the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the data that is transmitted from the management server <b>33</b> reaches the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> receives the data, and executes the search process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> with the data reception as a trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the search process starts, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> first executes vehicle compartment checking (S<b>401</b>). In the process of S<b>401</b>, the confirmation signal for confirming whether the mobile unit <b>2</b> exists or not is transmitted from the vehicle in-room antenna <b>17</b> and the in-trunk antenna <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Subsequently, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> checks whether the response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> or not (S<b>403</b>). In this example, when the response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> (Yes in S<b>403</b>), the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> transmits the search signal (S<b>405</b>). In the process of S<b>405</b>, the search signal for locating the mobile unit <b>2</b> is transmitted from the vehicle in-room antenna <b>17</b> and the in-trunk antenna <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Then, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> executes a message return process to the cell phone <b>34</b> (S<b>407</b>), and completes the locating process. Through the process of S<b>407</b>, the electronic mail that describes a message indicative of &#x201c;The mobile unit is in the vehicle compartment&#x201d; reaches the cell phone <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">More specifically, in the process of S<b>407</b>, the information required to transmit the electronic mail that describes the above message to the management server <b>33</b> is transmitted to the management server <b>33</b>. At a stage of transmitting the information from the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> to the management server <b>33</b>, when the information means &#x201c;The mobile unit is in the vehicle compartment,&#x201d; it is unnecessary to transmit text data having the above description, as long as a bit train representative of the necessary information is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The management server <b>33</b> that has received the above information produces data of the electronic mail form on the basis of the received information, and transmits the data to the cell phone <b>34</b>. That is, the management server <b>33</b> produces the text data describing &#x201c;The mobile unit is in the vehicle compartment,&#x201d; and the electronic mail including the text data is transmitted to the cell phone <b>34</b> from the management server <b>33</b>. As a result, as described above, the electronic mail that describes the massage indicative of &#x201c;The mobile unit is in the vehicle compartment&#x201d; reaches the cell phone <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">On the other hand, when no response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> (No in S<b>403</b>), the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> executes vehicle exterior checking (S<b>409</b>). In the process of S<b>409</b>, the confirmation signal for confirming whether the mobile unit <b>2</b> exists in the outside of the vehicle or not is transmitted from the door antennas <b>16</b> and the out-trunk antenna <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Subsequently, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> checks whether the response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> or not (S<b>411</b>). In this example, when the response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> (Yes in S<b>411</b>), the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> transmits the search signal (S<b>413</b>). In the process of S<b>413</b>, the search signal for locating the mobile unit <b>2</b> is transmitted from the door antennas <b>16</b> and the out-trunk antenna <b>19</b>. Alternatively, the search signal for locating the mobile unit <b>2</b> may be transmitted from the UHF transmitter unit <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the search signal is transmitted from the door antenna <b>16</b> and the out-trunk antenna <b>19</b>, the search signal is transmitted from the LF transmitter unit <b>11</b> by the electric wave of the LF band. Also, when the search signal is transmitted from the UHF transmitter unit <b>41</b>, the search signal is transmitted by the electric wave of the UHF band.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Which of the frequency bands to be used to transmit the search signal is arbitrary. In this embodiment, even if the mobile unit <b>2</b> receives the search signal that has been transmitted by the electric wave of the LF band through a process that will be described later, the smart entry function is not limited. On the contrary, when the mobile unit <b>2</b> receives the search signal that has been transmitted by the electric wave of the UHF band, the smart entry function is limited and not allowed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Accordingly, when it is proved that the mobile unit <b>2</b> exists in the vehicle exterior close to the vehicle as a result of locating, any one frequency band can be selected in advance taking into consideration whether the smart entry function should be limited or not. Alternatively, in the above case, which frequency band should be used can be arbitrarily set and changed by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">After the process of S<b>413</b> has been completed, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> then executes a message return process to the cell phone <b>34</b> (S<b>415</b>), and completes the locating process. Through the process of S<b>415</b>, the electronic mail that describes the message indicative of &#x201c;The mobile unit is outside the vehicle compartment&#x201d; reaches the cell phone <b>34</b>. The manner that the electronic mail reaches the cell phone <b>34</b> is the same as the process of S<b>407</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">On the other hand, when no response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> (No in S<b>411</b>), the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> transmits the search signal (S<b>417</b>). In the process of S<b>417</b>, the search signal for locating the mobile unit <b>2</b> is transmitted from the UHF transmitter unit <b>41</b>. As a result, the search signal is transmitted to the mobile unit <b>2</b> whose presence could not be confirmed within a range where the communication of the LF band is enabled by the electric wave of the UHF band longer in the communication distance than the LF band.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Then, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> checks whether the response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> or not (S<b>419</b>). In this situation, when the response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> (Yes in S<b>419</b>), the processing is advanced to the process of S<b>415</b> described above. The in-vehicle device <b>1</b> executes the message return process to the cell phone <b>34</b> (S<b>415</b>), and completes the locating process. Through the process of S<b>415</b>, the electronic mail that describes the message indicative of &#x201c;The mobile unit is outside the vehicle compartment&#x201d; reaches the cell phone <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">On the other hand, when no response is received from the mobile unit <b>2</b> (No in S<b>419</b>), the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> executes a message reply process to the cell phone <b>34</b> (S<b>421</b>), and completes the locating process. Through the process of S<b>421</b>, the electronic mail that describes the message indicative of &#x201c;No mobile unit is found&#x201d; reaches the cell phone <b>34</b>. The manner that the electronic mail reaches the cell phone <b>34</b> is the same as the process of S<b>407</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">When the above locating process is executed by the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, and the search signal that has been transmitted in any processes of S<b>405</b>, S<b>413</b>, and S<b>417</b> reaches the mobile unit <b>2</b>, the mobile unit <b>2</b> executes a notifying process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> with the reception of the search signal as a trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">That is, when the notifying process starts, the mobile unit <b>2</b> first checks whether an ID that is included in the received search signal agrees with an ID of the mobile unit <b>2</b> or not which has been registered in a nonvolatile memory that is incorporated into the control IC <b>20</b> or not (S<b>501</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the process of S<b>501</b>, when those IDs do not agree with each other (No in S<b>501</b>), the mobile unit <b>2</b> determines that the mobile unit <b>2</b> is not to be located, and therefore completes the notifying process. On the other hand, when those IDs agree with each other (Yes in S<b>501</b>), the mobile unit <b>2</b> activates the buzzer <b>28</b> and the display (LED) <b>27</b> into the blowing state and the lighting state, and starts a timer (S<b>503</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Then, the mobile unit <b>2</b> checks whether the UHF receiver unit <b>45</b> has received the search signal (S<b>505</b>). In this example, when the UHF receiver unit <b>45</b> receives the search signal (Yes in S<b>505</b>), the mobile unit <b>2</b> returns the response to the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> (S<b>507</b>), and changes the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> to the state in which the smart entry function is prohibited (S<b>509</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In more detail, in the process of S<b>509</b>, the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> changes from a normal state to a limited state. When the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is changed to the limited state, even if a radio communication for authentication is conducted between the mobile unit <b>2</b> and the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> can recognize that the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> has been changed to the limited state on the basis of the information that is obtained by the radio communication. Accordingly, in this case, the execution of the various controls by the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> can be limited by the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Alternatively, in the case where the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> has been changed to the limited state, when the radio communication with respect to the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> completely stops at the mobile unit <b>2</b>, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> cannot recognize the presence per se of the mobile unit <b>2</b>. Accordingly, even in this method, it is possible to limit the execution of the various controls by the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Although various controls to be limited are proposed, the following control is limited in this embodiment. That is, when the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is the normal state, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> conducts the unlocking control of the doors with the fact that the user who carries the mobile unit <b>2</b> touches a door knob as a turning point. On the other hand, when the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is the limited state, such an unlocking control is limited. As a result, it is possible to prevent a prowler from entering the vehicle compartment, or articles from being stolen from the vehicle compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Also, the same control is implemented in the trunk of the vehicle, thereby making it possible to prevent the articles from being stolen from the trunk.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Further, when the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is the normal state, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> conducts the starting control of an engine with the fact that the user who carries the mobile unit <b>2</b> operates the engine switch <b>15</b> as a turning point. However, when the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is the limited state, such an engine starting control is limited. As a result, it is possible to prevent the prowler from starting the engine for the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the unlocking control is limited, since the prowler can be normally prevented from entering the vehicle compartment, it is possible to block the engine starting by the limit of the unlocking control. However, since there is the possibility that the prowler enters the vehicle compartment by breaking a window or prizing a door, it is effective to limit the starting control by the engine switch <b>15</b>. Further, when those things occur, it is possible to use various security functions such that an alarm sound is issued together. When the above prohibition control of the smart entry function is attained, it is necessary to conduct given operation that is known by only the user in order to cancel the prohibition control, which will be described in more detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">On the other hand, when it is determined that the search signal is received by the LF receiver unit <b>21</b> (No in S<b>505</b>), the above processes of S<b>507</b> and S<b>509</b> are skipped.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The process of S<b>507</b> is skipped when the LF receiver unit <b>21</b> receives the search signal, because there arises no problem even if no response is sent from the mobile unit <b>2</b> again. This is because the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> recognizes that the mobile unit <b>2</b> has been already detected through the processes of S<b>401</b> to S<b>411</b>. In this respect, when the UHF receiver unit <b>45</b> receives the search signal, a reply sent in the process of S<b>507</b> is essential in conducting the determination process of S<b>419</b> at the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Also, when the search signal is received by the LF receiver unit <b>21</b>, the process of S<b>509</b> is skipped. This is because, for example, in the case where the mobile unit <b>2</b> is located in a state where the mobile unit <b>2</b> is left behind in the vehicle compartment, when the above prohibition control of the smart entry function is conducted each time, the necessity of the operation for canceling the prohibition control in each case is troublesome for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">That is, in the case where the mobile unit <b>2</b> falls at a position apart from the vehicle, when the buzzer <b>28</b> is blown by the process of S<b>503</b>, there is a possibility that the prowler other than the authorized user is aware of the presence of the mobile unit <b>2</b> and picks up the mobile unit <b>2</b>. For this reason, in this case, it is preferable to conduct the prohibition control of the smart entry function by the process of the above S<b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">However, when the mobile unit <b>2</b> is left in the vehicle, it is usually presumed that the authorized user retrieves the mobile unit <b>2</b> in the vicinity of the vehicle. Similarly, when locking of the mobile unit <b>2</b> in the vehicle compartment is detected by the locking operation as described in the above first embodiment, and the mobile unit locating is executed in association with the detection, it is presumed that the authorized user who is going to conduct the locking operation is in the vicinity of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Accordingly, in this case, since the authorized user can immediately find the mobile unit <b>2</b> when the buzzer <b>28</b> is blown by the process of S<b>503</b>, the possibility that a prowler picks up the mobile unit <b>2</b> is extremely low. Hence, in this case, the above process of S<b>509</b> can be skipped, as a result of which it is unnecessary to conduct the cancel operation that is troublesome for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In order to further enhance the security, the prohibition control of the smart entry function is always conducted when the mobile unit <b>2</b> is retrieved. Alternatively, it is possible that the user arbitrarily changes setting of whether the prohibition control of the smart entry function is always conducted, or the prohibition control of the smart entry function is conducted only when the UHF receiver unit <b>45</b> receives the search signal.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">After the above processes of S<b>507</b> and S<b>509</b> are completed or skipped, the processing is advanced to the process of S<b>511</b>, and the mobile unit <b>2</b> checks whether time up is made or not (S<b>511</b>). In the process of S<b>511</b>, when a given period of time (10 seconds in this embodiment) has not elapsed from a timer start in the process of S<b>503</b>, it is determined that no time up is made (No in S<b>511</b>), and in this case, the process of S<b>511</b> is kept to wait until the given period of time elapses.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Then, when it is determined that the given period of time has elapsed, and time up is made (Yes in S<b>511</b>), the buzzer <b>28</b> stops (S<b>513</b>) to complete the notifying process.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Subsequently, a prohibition cancel process of the smart entry function is attained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The respective processes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> are examples of the prohibition cancel process of the smart entry function. The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an example in which the prohibition cancel of the smart entry function is conducted via a communication with another device. The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an example in which the prohibition cancel of the smart entry function is conducted by the operation of the mobile unit <b>2</b> by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">First, the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is executed in the mobile unit <b>2</b> with the reception of the cancel signal as a trigger in the case where the cancel signal reaches the mobile unit <b>2</b>, when the cancel signal is transmitted from another device to the mobile unit <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In this example, another device may be the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> or a dedicated device provided in an automobile dealer. When another device is the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, an instruction is transmitted to the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> from the user by using a user interface of the cell phone <b>34</b>, like the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The in-vehicle device <b>1</b> that has received the instruction executes the cancel signal transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">When the mobile unit <b>2</b> that has received the cancel signal starts the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the mobile unit <b>2</b> first checks whether the ID that is included in the received search signal agrees with the ID of the mobile unit <b>2</b> which has been registered in the nonvolatile memory that is incorporated into the control IC <b>20</b> or not (S<b>601</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">When those IDs do not agree with each other (No in S<b>601</b>), the mobile unit <b>2</b> can determine that the mobile unit <b>2</b> is not to be located, and therefore completes the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. On the other hand, when those IDs agree with each other (Yes in S<b>601</b>), the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is returned to the normal state from the limited state, thereby canceling the prohibition of the smart entry function, that is, allowing the smart entry function (S<b>603</b>), and completes the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As a result, since the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is returned to the normal state, the smart entry function can be thereafter used by the mobile unit <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is executed with the operation of the push switches <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> on the mobile unit <b>2</b> in a given procedure or pattern by the user as a trigger. The given procedure or pattern includes a procedure that has been registered by the user in advance, and a procedure of inputting a security code or a password which is known only by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this process, the mobile unit <b>2</b> checks whether or not the operation pattern of the push switches <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> agrees with and same as the operation pattern that has been registered in the nonvolatile memory provided in the control IC <b>20</b> in advance (S<b>701</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When the operation patterns agree with each other (Yes in S<b>701</b>), the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is returned to the normal state from the limited state, thereby canceling the prohibition of and allowing the smart entry function (S<b>703</b>). As a result, since the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is returned to the normal state, the smart entry function can be thereafter used by the mobile unit <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">On the other hand, when the operation patterns do not agree with each other (No in S<b>701</b>), the mobile unit <b>2</b> activates the buzzer <b>28</b>, and starts the timer (S<b>705</b>). Thereafter, the mobile unit <b>2</b> checks whether time up is made or not (S<b>707</b>). When it is determined that no time up is made (No in S<b>707</b>), the process of S<b>707</b> is kept to wait until the given period of time (e.g., 10 seconds) elapses.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Then, when it is determined that the given period of time has elapsed, and time up is made (Yes in S<b>707</b>), the buzzer <b>28</b> is stopped (S<b>709</b>) to complete the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The buzzer <b>28</b> is blown by the process of S<b>705</b>, because when the authorized user erroneously conducts the cancel operation, the fact is notified. Also, this is because when the prowler attempts the cancel operation, the sound intimidates the prowler so that the prowler gives up the cancel operation.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">According to the second embodiment, when the search signal for locating the mobile unit <b>2</b> is transmitted to the mobile unit <b>2</b> from the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>, the display unit <b>27</b> and the buzzer <b>28</b> which is disposed at the mobile unit <b>2</b> operates, and informs the periphery of the fact that the mobile unit <b>2</b> exists. Accordingly, even when the mobile unit <b>2</b> is placed in the pocket of clothing or a bag which is located in the vehicle compartment, the user can easily find out the mobile unit <b>2</b> by the sound that is issued by the buzzer <b>28</b>. Also, even in a state where the vehicle compartment is dark such as in the night, the user can easily find out the mobile unit <b>2</b> by the light that is emitted by the display unit <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Also, since the mobile unit <b>2</b> is retrieved by the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> that is mounted in the vehicle, a mobile unit locating device is not required. Also, unlike a compact mobile unit locating device, the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> does not suffer from such drawbacks that the user does not tuck the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> in some place, and also does not forget the place in which the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> is tucked.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Further, the mobile unit <b>2</b> changes the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> to the limited state when receiving the search signal. Then, when the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is changed to the limited state, at least a part of the various controls that can be executed by the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> is not executed.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Accordingly, the functions having the possibility that there occur damages such as vehicle theft or the theft of articles within the vehicle compartment or the trunk compartment are limited, thereby making it possible to prevent the above respective damages. Also, the authorized user returns the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> from the limited state to the normal state by conducting given operation or by the aid of a dedicated device, thereby making it possible to cancel the limitation at the vehicle side.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Also, in the case of the electronic key system, when the mobile unit <b>2</b> exists in the vehicle exterior where the possibility that the mobile unit <b>2</b> is picked up by the prowler is comparatively high, the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is changed from the normal state to the limited state. On the other hand, when the mobile unit <b>2</b> exists in the vehicle compartment where the possibility that the mobile unit <b>2</b> is picked up by the prowler is low, the status of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is not changed from the normal state. Accordingly, it is possible to balance both functions, one being the security measure when the mobile unit <b>2</b> is picked up by the prowler, and the other being convenience when the user leaves the mobile unit <b>2</b> in the vehicle compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The electronic key system can instruct the locating of the mobile unit <b>2</b> by the aid of the cell phone <b>34</b>, and the locating result is reported to the cell phone <b>34</b>. As a result, it is unnecessary to provide the display device and an input device which form the user interfaces in the in-vehicle device <b>1</b>. The user can conduct the locating operation by the cell phone <b>34</b>, which the user is familiar with and can operate without difficulty.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">When the mobile unit <b>2</b> is located, since the user is informed that the mobile unit <b>2</b> is in the vehicle compartment, in the vehicle exterior, or is not found out, the user can conduct an appropriate countermeasure according to the state.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The search signal is transmitted by the electric waves of the different frequency bands when the vehicle compartment is searched or the vehicle exterior is searched. Therefore, the detection range is appropriately narrowed down, and where the mobile unit <b>2</b> has been found out can be appropriately reported to the user, unlike a case in which only the appropriate frequency band is used in limiting the detection area to the vehicle compartment, or a case in which only the appropriate frequency band is used in ensuring the communication distance.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In particular, since the LF band and the UHF band are used as the different frequency bands, the detection area of the mobile unit <b>2</b> can be easily limited to about 1 to 3 m in the periphery of the vehicle in the communication of the LF band. On the other hand, in the communication of the UHF band, the communication distance of several tens meters can be ensured when the output level at the transmission side is slight, and the communication distance of about several hundreds to thousand meters can be ensured when the output level is more increased. As a result, the detection area can be easily widely set.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(Modifications)</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The present invention is not limited to the above specific embodiments, and can be implemented in other configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">For example, in the above embodiments, when the mobile unit <b>2</b> is to be located, the use of the smart entry function of the mobile unit <b>2</b> is limited. However, when the mobile unit <b>2</b> has the remote keyless entry function, the use of the remote keyless entry function may be also limited.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the above second embodiment, the UHF transmitter unit <b>41</b> is newly disposed in addition to the existing UHF receiver unit <b>12</b>. Alternatively, a UHF transmitter/receiver unit <b>61</b> may be disposed in the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> instead of the UHF receiver unit <b>12</b> and the UHF transmitter unit <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the UHF transmitter/receiver unit <b>61</b> is so configured as to internally include a UHF receiver unit <b>63</b> and a UHF transmitter unit <b>65</b>. A transmit/receive changeover switch <b>67</b> changes over whether the reception is to be conducted by the UHF receiver unit <b>63</b>, or the transmission is to be conducted by the UHF transmitter unit <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The UHF transmitter/receiver unit <b>61</b> is so configured as to change over the transmission or reception by the transmit/receive changeover switch <b>67</b> to conduct a half-duplex communication. This configuration can be replaced with another configuration when the transmission/reception can be implemented. For example, the transmit/receive changeover switch <b>67</b> is replaced with a circulator, thereby conduct the transmission/reception by a full duplex communication.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In addition, the above second embodiment shows an example in which the cell phone <b>34</b> transmits or receives the electronic mail with respect to the management server <b>33</b>. Data can be delivered in any data format in a communication between the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> and the management server <b>33</b>, or a communication between the cell phone <b>34</b> and the management server <b>33</b>. In this situation, any communication protocol can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">For example, when the in-vehicle device <b>1</b> has an electronic mail transmitting function, since the electronic mail can be transmitted to the cell phone <b>34</b> via the mail server, the above configuration can be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Also, in the above embodiments, the fact that the mobile unit <b>2</b> has been found is described in the electronic mail. Instead, an address (URL) on Internet can be described in the electronic mail. In this case, when the cell phone <b>34</b> accesses to the address, a web page that is distributed from the web server is displayed, and information indicative of the fact that the mobile unit <b>2</b> has been found out can be displayed in the web page.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The above embodiments may further be modified to an electronic key system for door control of other objects, which may include a home and an office.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 USC 119 to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/702,117 filed on Jul. 25, 2005 entitled &#x201c;Man-Machine Interface, or Remote Control, Having Convenient Operation Features&#x201d;, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to intuitive based control elements, and interfaces and devices using said control elements.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Remote control units for televisions are used to control operations of various types of video systems, audio systems, computers, and other devices. Certain types of remote controls are created specific to a particular model unit, while other types of remote controls are universal and can be programmed for the majority of televisions or other devices available on the market today. Remote controls are used to change channels, volume control, on/off control and many other features that different televisions and other devices are equipped with today.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Remote control devices for television sets and other electronic devices fall into two broad categories: those which are hard wired to the appliance, and those which transmit an electromagnetic wave, usually in the infrared portion of the spectrum, which is received and decoded by the appliance. The infrared devices generally comprise a housing having one or more buttons or switches which serve as the user interface, one or more integrated circuits to translate the user command to a digital or binary signal, an infrared light emitting diode (LED) and associated driver circuitry, a power source (usually batteries), and, optionally, a visible LED to signal the user when the remote control unit has power and/or is transmitting.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Most available remote controls for televisions and other equipment have typically been housed in the form of rectangular slabs, or rectangular slabs with curved portions for design and to enlarge the keypad area. One face of the control typically includes plural control buttons, forming a keypad.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Examples of ergonomically shaped or multi-function remote control units include U.S. Des. Pat. No. 380,449 (shaped like an exercise grip, with or without knurls); U.S. Pat. No. 5,457,448 (round, weighted bottom provided so it always stands upright, with minimal number of keys); U.S. Pat. No. 5,481,256, (includes a scan function to scan channels); and International Patent WO 94/01844 (providing a keypad with geometrical shapes corresponding to the function or number). Further, various pistol shaped remote controls have been disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,573,854, 5,675,427, U.K. Patent No. 2,281,138.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, various user interface based remote control devices are known, including U.S. Pat. No. 6,762,773 (displaying stored icons sharing common visual characteristic with corresponding button on remote control); U.S. Pat. No. 6,292,210 (integrated remote control and phone user interface e.g. for telephone systems, employs user interface which includes graphical screens which can be configured by the user to appear as a picture-in-picture with a video broadcast program); U.S. Pat. No. 6,882,299 (discloses a graphical remote controller for multiple consumer devices including a touch screen based graphical display using title based descriptions to select the appropriate device); U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,857 (discloses a remote control employing a touch screen to reduce the number of keys of the remote controller)</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One problem common with many of the above described remote controls is that they are difficult for certain individuals, including young children, elderly, those with severe arthritic or other physically debilitating conditions, or those with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or other mentally debilitating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,799 discloses a computer pointer control device adapted for ease of use by handicapped individuals. The device includes a mating cradle that sits on top of a base having a track ball. The upper surface of the cradle support is shaped to accept the forearm of an operator. The operator can move the cursor up and down on the screen by pushing his or her arm outwardly or inwardly and can move the cursor left to right on the screen by rotating his or her arm in the cradle about its longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Certain remote control devices are marketed towards individuals that have trouble with, or do not need, all of the functions available on a standard remote, such as the elderly, people with Alzheimer's Disease or Dementia, those who are cognitively or visually impaired, those who are physically disabled including arthritis sufferers, caregivers, children, or those who do not desire the complex functionality of typical remote controls. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref>, certain remote control devices are shown that exist today. These include a conventional Zenith&#xae; Universal Remote ZEN-SP, with an on/off button and a circular arrangement of arrow buttons, and the weemote&#xae; 3 Sr. TV remote for adults, marketed by Fobis Technologies, Inc., Pinecrest, Fla. However, the inventor hereof has found that these devices, while promoted as a simple remote control that is customizable, still can be difficult for certain individuals to use.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">While these devices and other remote control devices may be suitable for their intended purposes, there remains a need in the art for improved remote control devices, particularly for individuals with limited capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other devices also suffer from drawbacks related to ease of use, particularly for the elderly, people with Alzheimer's Disease or Dementia, those who are cognitively or visually impaired, those who are physically disabled including arthritis sufferers, caregivers, children, or those who do not desire the complex functionality of typical device.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Improvements in quality of life for people with Alzheimer's Disease or Dementia have been proposed based on the Montessori Educational Approach, created by Maria Montessori (1870-1952). &#x201c;Montessori worked with underprivileged children who were labeled &#x201c;unteachable.&#x201d; &#x201c;Her goal in working with these children was to improve their quality of life . . . &#x201d; all &#x201c;based on the abilities available to the children.&#x201d; &#x201c;The goal of the Montessori method is to create persons who are as independent as possible, able to make choices, and who are treated with respect and dignity.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">&#x201c;Our lives are defined by what we do. Everything we do, from the time we wake up, to the time we eat dinner . . . is an activity.

This remains true even when one develops cognitive impairments.&#x201d; Directions on using &#x201c;the Montessori Method as a way to CREATE activities&#x201d; include the following: &#x201c;(use) materials (that) are familiar, aesthetically pleasing, and are often taken from the everyday environment; materials should be easily recognizable and visible; use of external cues and/or templates is common; the information needed for completing a task should be built into the materials; avoid unnecessary background clutter on materials to prevent distraction; materials should also be free of unimportant letters, numbers, words, and markings; activities should be an error-free source of success for clients . . . ; find and focus on the memories and abilities that are still intact; activities should have a clear objective that is meaningful to the client.&#x201d; <i>Myers Research Institute, Montessori</i>-<i>Based Dementia Programming&#xae;.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a man-machine interface <b>100</b> (e.g., in the form of a remote control) is provided. Man-machine interface <b>100</b> is configured, for example, in the form of a typical remote control, as a rectangular slab. However, in contrast to a conventional remote control, the man-machine interface is provided with control elements <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> positioned at intuitive locations upon the front surface <b>114</b> of the man-machine interface <b>100</b>. This may be particularly useful for individuals with diminished mental and/or physical capability, or very young children, in that the remote control functionality may be simplified to the bare essential features, with control elements or buttons intuitively shaped and/or positioned upon the remote control device.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, as shown, control elements <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are in the position of ears, and may be pre-set or programmed to control audio functions such as volume. Also, as shown, control elements <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are in the position of eyes, and may be pre-set or programmed to control video functions such as channels, programs or files (e.g., on stored media), or other video functions. Control elements <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, shown in the position of a nose and a mouth, are optionally provided to control power on and off, or other pre-set or preprogrammed functions.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Each control element may be the same or different. The control elements are capable of actuation upon being depressed, rotated, twisted, pulled, slid, rubbed, touch-screen actuated, manipulated, or any combination of the foregoing actions. One or more control elements may be provided with scroll functionality, for example, similar to jog wheel functionality known on audio and video devices (for example, control elements in the position of and/or configuration of eyes may scroll as in a track ball application to perform the jog wheel function). Further, while certain embodiments herein depict a pair of corresponding elements (e.g., in the position of and/or configuration of a pair of eyes or a pair of ears) that perform different functions (e.g., left eye to select an image or channel down, right eye to select an image or channel up), these functions may be reversed, or both control elements may be redundant, for example, wherein the control element in the position of and/or configuration of an eye may be rolled about a track or twisted like a dial to control image or channel selection, or wherein control elements in the position of and/or configuration of an ear may be twisted to increase or decrease volume.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown, the control elements are positioned at locations on the surface <b>114</b> of the man-machine interface <b>100</b> housing corresponding to various parts of the face including ears, eyes, nose and mouth. Other parts of the face may also be represented, including cheeks, chin, forehead, or top portions of a head. Further, other body parts including but not limited to arms, hands, legs, feet, chest or belly may be represented. Alternatively, or in combination with control elements in the position of certain facial parts, the control elements may be shaped in the form of a part of the face selected from the group consisting of ears, eyes, mouth, nose, cheek, and chin.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The control elements may be in various configurations and types. For example, they may protrude from the body of the man-machine interface <b>100</b> in various three dimensional configurations, or optionally may lie flush or be recessed for certain limited functions. Alternatively, the control elements may be pressure sensors, optical sensors, or heat sensors, in the form of touch pad or screen sensors. In still further alternatives, one or more of the control elements of man-machine interface <b>100</b> may be provided in the configuration of sliding controls, roller-ball controls, or other control capable of being manipulated.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, various control elements described herein may be of suitable color to further indicate the function, for example, green to turn something on, and red to turn something off. In further alternatives, various control elements described herein may include various lighting enhancement, for example, through a backlight, to indicate operation or other features.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The man-machine interface <b>100</b> includes a transmission sub-system (represented schematically with reference to a transmission element <b>116</b>) for transmitting a signal from the control elements to the device to be controlled. This may be any conventional circuitry or sub-systems for transmitting a signal upon actuation of control elements from the remote device to the device to be controlled. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to include plural transmission elements and/or sub-systems to allow for multi-directional control of the device to be controlled, which is particularly well suited for people with cognitive disabilities. In particular, where the control elements are intuitively shaped and/or positioned upon the remote control device, the orientation of the device will not be significant to the user. The transmission sub-system may comprise a wireless transmission subsystem such as an IR transmission sub-system, an RF transmission sub-system or an optical transmission sub-system; or a wired sub-system for transmitting via wire signals to the device to be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The man-machine interface <b>100</b> may optionally include (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) a master control device disposed within at least a portion of said body and operably coupled to one or preferably all of the control elements. In this configuration, the transmission sub-system transmits a signal from said master control panel to the device to be controlled. The master control device may include a self contained programmable control device.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The electronics and other transmitter circuitry for wireless or wired transmission of signals may be included in the master control device, or elsewhere in the man-machine interface <b>100</b>. For example, where the transmitter circuitry is included in the master control device, it may function independently as a man-machine interface or remote control.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The transmission sub-system may be pre-programmed for a certain device or brand of devices to be controlled, or may be programmable by the user or the user's caregiver. For example, the device may be programmed similar to a conventional &#x201c;universal remote&#x201d; control device. Alternatively, the man-machine interface herein may be programmable with a master control device described herein. In further embodiments, a computer interface is provided on the device to allow for programming, such as Internet-based programming or other software. The interface may be wired (e.g., a Universal serial bus, serial port connection, parallel port connection, IEEE 1394 connection (Firewire or iLink), ethernet connection) or wireless (e.g., wireless local area network, wireless broadband network, Bluetooth, cellular digital packet technology, wireless metropolitan networks, or other wireless connectivity) For example, in one example, the device may be programmed based on user, parent, guardian or caretaker selections of certain programmed stations within software or a web site displaying a list of stations to select from. Priority may be assigned to certain stations.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A master control device may be in the form of a cartridge or computer media. For example, the cartridge may be programmable upon interfacing with a computer device. The computer device may be dedicated to the man-machine interface <b>100</b> herein, or may be integrated in an existing computer device. The computer media may be selected from the group consisting of computer diskettes, flash memory devices, CD-ROMs, DVDs, magnetic hard drives, other forms of media, and combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing media forms.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A computer device to program the master control device described above may include typical personal computer including PC or Apple&#xae; based computer, portable computer, PDA, a dedicated computer device used specifically for the man-machine interface <b>100</b>, embedded computer system within the &#x201c;machine&#x201d; to be controlled, or any other suitable computer device, that is programmed with suitable software and/or firmware to control the functionality of the master control device.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The interfaces between the control elements of the man-machine interface <b>100</b> and the master device may be by suitable electronic, optical, IR, RF, or wired interface. Alternatively, or in combination, the man-machine interface <b>100</b> may include a suitable mechanical or electro-mechanical interface between the master control device and at least one of the control elements. In certain embodiments, the mechanical interface may be configured for interfacing with an existing remote control device. An existing control device may include a stock remote control device that is sold with the device to be controlled, an aftermarket universal remote control, or a custom remote control device.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Another feature of certain embodiments of the present invention is an optional locator sub-system. For example, when one touches a &#x201c;locate&#x201d; button on a base or a device being controlled, or on a finder device, a radio frequency signal is transmitted and the device emits certain audible sounds or programmed recordings.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Another feature of certain embodiments of the present invention is an optional speech generating sub-system. Upon producing a signal with at least one control element, the speech generating sub-system speaks the function of said at least one control element. For example, when the power is turned on, a computer generated voice or pre-recorded voice speaks the phrase &#x201c;device on&#x201d; or other suitable phrase.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Embodiments of the present invention in the form of man-machine interfaces or remote control devices may be used independently and in conjunction with existing remote controls for various devices with standard features.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>, another example of a man-machine interface is provided, man-machine interface <b>200</b>, As shown, the housing <b>218</b> is configured in the general shape of a face of an animate being. For example, as shown, control elements <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> are in the position of and general shape of ears, and may be pre-set or programmed to control audio functions such as volume. Also, as shown, control elements <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> are in the position of and general shape of eyes, and may be pre-set or programmed to control video functions such as channels, programs or files (e.g., on stored media), or other video functions. Control elements <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>, shown in the position of a nose and a mouth, respectively, are optionally provided to control power on and off, or other pre-set or preprogrammed functions. Control element <b>212</b> may also be in the general shape of a mouth or a smile, for example, indicating device &#x201c;power on&#x201d; as conveying a general sense of pleasure to the user.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a transflective (semitransmissive) liquid crystal display device in which both a reflective region and a transmissive region are provided in each pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Because liquid crystal display (hereinafter simply referred to as &#x201c;LCD&#x201d;) devices have advantages such as thin thickness and low power consumption, the LCD devices are currently widely in use as a computer monitor and a monitor for a portable information device. In an LCD, liquid crystal is sealed between a pair of substrates and alignment of the liquid crystal positioned between the substrates is controlled by electrodes formed on the substrates to realize a display. Unlike CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) display devices and electroluminescence (hereinafter simply referred to as &#x201c;EL&#x201d;) display devices, fundamentally, the LCD is not self-emissive, and, therefore, requires a light source for displaying an image for an observer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a transmissive LCD, a transparent electrode is employed as the electrodes to be formed on the substrates, a light source is provided at the back or side of a liquid crystal display panel and an amount of transmission of light from the light source is controlled in the liquid crystal panel to achieve a bright display even in a dark surroundings. However, because the light source is always being switched on to achieve display, power consumption by the light source is unavoidable, and, moreover, there is a disadvantage that sufficient contrast cannot be secured in an environment with intense ambient light such as outdoors during daytime.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a reflective LCD, on the other hand, ambient light such as the sun and the indoor light is used as the light source. The ambient light entering the liquid crystal panel is reflected by a reflective electrode formed on a substrate on a side of a non-observation surface. A display is realized by controlling, for each pixel, the amount of emission light from the liquid crystal panel of the light which enters the liquid crystal layer and is reflected by the reflective electrode. Because the reflective LCD uses the ambient light as the light source, no power is consumed by the light source unlike the transmissive LCD and, consequently, has a very low power consumption. The reflective LCD has a characteristic that a sufficient contrast can be obtained when the environment is bright such as the outdoors, but the display cannot be viewed when there is no ambient light.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recently, a transflective (semitransmissive) LCD has been proposed and attracted much attention as a display that can easily be seen outdoors and also in a dark environment. The transflective LCD has both a reflective function and a transmissive function as shown in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 11-101992 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2003-255399. In a transflective LCD, a transmissive region and a reflective region are provided within a pixel region to obtain both the transmissive function and the reflective function.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Because the transflective LCDs have superior visibility both outdoors and under dark environment, the use of the transflective LCD as a display, for example, of a portable information device is very effective.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in a portable information device, various viewing conditions can be considered, and the viewing angle must be widened in order to achieve display of high quality in any of the various viewing conditions (in particular, various viewing angles).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, in a transflective LCD, because the semi-transmissivity is achieved by dividing a pixel into a transmissive region and a reflective region, the transmission characteristic and the reflection characteristic are lower than that in the transmissive LCD and that in the reflective LCD, respectively. Therefore, in order to improve the display quality in each display region (transmissive region and reflective region), it is necessary to achieve a higher contrast in both regions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in the field of transflective LCDs, efforts have been devoted for improving a structure for realizing both a transmissive mechanism and the reflective mechanism in one structure, and attempts have not been made for improvement in the display quality such as widening of the viewing angle and improvement of the contrast.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention advantageously provides a transflective LCD and a color LCD with a high display quality.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a transflective LCD comprising a plurality of pixels, and a vertical alignment liquid crystal layer which is sealed between a first substrate having a first electrode and a second substrate having a second electrode, wherein each pixel region comprises a reflective region and a transmissive region, the reflective region comprises a gap adjusting section, on at least one of sides of the first substrate and the second substrate, which sets a gap defined by a thickness of the liquid crystal layer which controls a phase difference of light incident on the liquid crystal layer so that the gap is smaller in the reflective region than in the transmissive region, and the pixel region comprises an alignment controller which divides an alignment direction of the liquid crystal within the pixel region on at least one of the sides of the first substrate and the second substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this manner, by using a vertical alignment liquid crystal layer in a transflective LCD, the responsiveness can be improved compared to, for example, well-known TN (Twisted Nematic) liquid crystal and a display of a high contrast can be realized. In addition, in vertical alignment liquid crystal, the alignment of the liquid crystal is controlled to be in parallel or perpendicular to a plane of the substrate as opposed to the TN liquid crystal or the like in which a pre-tilt is applied and the alignment is controlled. Because of this structure, the viewing angle dependency is fundamentally low and the viewing angle can be widened compared to TN liquid crystal. In addition, in the present invention, an alignment controller for dividing the alignment direction of the liquid crystal within a pixel region is provided within a pixel region, even when the LCD is observed from various angles, a possibility that the observation position is within an optimum range of viewing angles of the various divided regions is high, and thus, it is possible to further widen the viewing angle of the pixel. Therefore, even when the environment is dark or bright, it is possible to realize a display which is highly responsive, has a wide viewing angle, and has a high contrast ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Even in a simple calculation, it can be seen that a total optical path length within the liquid crystal layer differs in the reflective region in which the incident light is transmitted through the liquid crystal layer twice and in the transmissive region in which the incident light is transmitted only once. By providing a gap adjusting section within a pixel region, an optimum thickness of the liquid crystal layer (cell gap) can be obtained in the reflective region and in the transmissive region. Therefore, coloring does not occur in the reflective region or in the transmissive region and an optimum reflectivity and transmissivity can be achieved. Therefore, it is possible to achieve a display which is bright and has a superior color reproducibility.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that, in the transflective LCD, the alignment controller comprises an electrode absent section which is formed in at least one of the first electrode and the second electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that, in the transflective LCD, the alignment controller comprises a projection which projects toward the liquid crystal layer from at least one of the sides of the first substrate and the second substrate. Alternatively, both the electrode absent section and the projection may be provided in a pixel region as the alignment controller.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that, in the transflective LCD, an end surface of the gap adjusting section in the pixel region functions as the alignment controller.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that, in the transflective LCD, an angular difference between an alignment direction of the liquid crystal controlled by the alignment controller in the pixel region and an alignment direction of the liquid crystal controlled by another alignment controller having a projection line which intersects a projection line of the alignment controller onto a plane of the substrate is less than 90 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">By achieving an angular difference of less than 90 degrees, it is possible to reliably prevent problems such as generation of asperity in display due to generation of a disclination line (boundary of regions having different alignment directions) in an uncertain position within a pixel divided by the alignment controller.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that, in the transflective LCD, the plurality of pixels include a pixel for red, a pixel for green, and a pixel for blue, and the gap in at least one of the transmissive region and the reflective region of each pixel of at least one of the pixel for red, pixel for green, and pixel for blue differs from the gap in the pixels of other colors.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the pixels for red, green, and blue, transmittances of light having different colors (R, G, and B), that is, different wavelengths, are controlled by the liquid crystal layer. Therefore, the optimum gap (thickness of the liquid crystal layer) may differ from each other depending on the wavelengths to be transmitted. In such a case, by changing the gap of R, G, or B pixel to be different from the gap of the other colors, it is possible to easily obtain a full-color LCD having a low wavelength dependency and a superior color reproducibility. In addition, because the wavelength dependency can be reduced, identical driving conditions can be used for each pixel, allowing for reduction in processing load of the driver circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to another aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that, in the transflective LCD, a quarter wavelength plate and a half wavelength plate are provided on the first substrate and the second substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">By providing both a quarter wavelength plate and a half wavelength plate, combining the wavelength plates with a linear polarizer plate, and using the combined structure as a wide wavelength band circular polarizer plate, it is possible to more reliably obtain required circular polarization for the vertical alignment liquid crystal layer for all of the R, G, and B light having different wavelengths, allowing for a further reduction of the wavelength dependency of the LCD.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to another aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that, in the transflective LCD, of the first substrate and the second substrate, a substrate opposing a substrate which is placed near a light source comprises a phase difference plate having a negative refractive index anisotropy.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">By providing a phase difference plate (negative retarder) having a negative refractive index anisotropy (optical anisotropy), it is possible to apply optical compensation for the vertical alignment liquid crystal layer (liquid crystal cell), allowing for a further widening of the viewing angle of the LCD.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to another aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that, in the transflective LCD, a biaxial phase difference plate is provide on at least one of the first substrate and the second substrate. By using the biaxial phase difference plate, it is possible to realize, with one phase difference plate, the functions of, for example, a combination of the negative retarder and the quarter wavelength plate and the negative retarder and the half wavelength plate, to reduce the thickness and to minimize the optical loss.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to another aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that, in the transflective LCD, a plurality of the first electrodes are formed on the side of the first substrate each in an individual pattern for each pixel, a thin film transistor is connected to each of the plurality of first electrodes, the second electrode formed on the side of the second substrate is formed as a common electrode which is common to the plurality of pixels, and the gap adjusting section is formed on the side of the second substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">By forming the gap adjusting section on the side of the second substrate, it is possible to form the first substrate side through steps that are common for the plurality of pixels even when a thin film transistor is to be formed on the first substrate side. Thus, it is possible to form the gap adjusting section on the side of the second substrate having a simpler structure than the first substrate simultaneously with the manufacturing of the first substrate having a long total manufacturing time because the first substrate has a larger number of elements, allowing for improvement in the manufacturing efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a transflective liquid crystal display device comprising a plurality of pixels, and vertical alignment liquid crystal which is sealed between a first substrate having a first electrode and a second substrate having a second electrode, wherein each pixel region comprises a reflective region and a transmissive region, a gap adjusting section which sets a gap defined by a thickness of the liquid crystal layer which controls a phase difference of light incident on the liquid crystal layer to be smaller in the reflective region than that in the transmissive region is provided on at least one of sides of the first substrate and the second substrate, and a side surface of the gap adjusting layer has a forward tapered shape in which the width increases toward the substrate on which the gap adjusting layer is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this manner, by employing a forward tapered shape in the side surface of the gap adjusting layer, it is possible to prevent disturbance in the alignment of the liquid crystal at the side surface and to use the side surface as an inclined surface for controlling the alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described, in the present invention, the viewing angle can be widened and the contrast and the response speed can be improved in a transflective LCD, allowing for realization of an LCD having a high display quality.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a vertical alignment liquid crystal display device having pixels for red, green, and blue for displaying three primary colors of red, green, and blue, the vertical alignment liquid crystal display device comprising a first substrate on which a pixel electrode is formed for each pixel, a second substrate which is placed opposing the first substrate and which has a common electrode, liquid crystal which is sealed between the first substrate and the second substrate and which has a negative dielectric constant anisotropy, a red color filter layer, a green color filter layer, and a blue color filter layer which are placed on the second substrate corresponding to the pixels for red, green, and blue, a first vertical alignment film which is formed covering the pixel electrode, and a second vertical alignment film which is formed closer to the liquid crystal than are the common electrode, the red color filter layer, the green color filter layer, and the blue color filter layer, wherein a condition of D-blue&#x2267;D-green&#x3e;D-red is satisfied wherein D-red is a thickness of the red color filter layer, D-green is a thickness of the green color filter layer, and D-blue is a thickness of the blue color filter layer.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Preferred embodiments (hereinafter simply referred to as &#x201c;embodiments&#x201d;) of the present invention will now be described referring to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows a cross sectional structure of a transflective active matrix LCD which is used as the transflective LCD according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The transflective LCD according to the first preferred embodiment comprises a plurality of pixels, wherein a first substrate and a second substrate on which a first electrode <b>200</b> and a second electrode <b>320</b> are formed respectively on a side opposing each other are adhered to each other with a liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> therebetween, and a transmissive region <b>210</b> and a reflective region <b>220</b> are formed in each pixel region.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A vertical alignment liquid crystal having a negative dielectric constant anisotropy is used as the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> and an alignment controller <b>500</b> (alignment divider) for dividing a pixel region into a plurality of alignment regions is provided on the side of the second substrate or on the side of the first substrate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the alignment controller <b>500</b> comprises, for example, a projection <b>510</b> which projects toward the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b>, an inclined section <b>520</b>, and an electrode absent section which is formed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by a gap between pixel electrodes <b>200</b> (details will be described later).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A transparent substrate such as glass is used for the first substrate <b>100</b> and the second substrate <b>300</b>. On the side of the first substrate <b>100</b>, a pixel electrode <b>200</b> in which a transparent conductive metal oxide such as an ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) and IZO (Indium Zinc Oxide) is used is formed in an individual pattern for each pixel as a first electrode and a switching element (not shown; refer to a description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to be described later) such as a thin film transistor which is connected to the pixel electrode <b>200</b> is formed. Over the entire surface of the first substrate <b>100</b>, an alignment film <b>260</b> for vertical alignment is formed over the pixel electrode <b>200</b>. As the alignment film <b>260</b>, for example, polyimide or the like is used, and, in the present embodiment, a rubbingless type alignment film is used so that the initial alignment of the liquid crystal (alignment when no voltage is applied) is set to be perpendicular (vertical) to the plane direction of the film. With a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> (details to be described later), a transparent region <b>210</b> which is made solely of the transparent electrode and a reflective region <b>220</b> in which a reflective film or a reflective electrode which is layered to the transparent electrode is formed can be provided in a formation region of one pixel electrode <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">On the second substrate <b>300</b> which is adhered to the first substrate <b>100</b> with the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> therebetween, a red color filter <b>330</b><i>r</i>, a green color filter <b>330</b><i>g</i>, and a blue color filter <b>330</b><i>b </i>are formed on a surface facing the liquid crystal at predetermined corresponding positions. In a gap between the color filters <b>330</b><i>r</i>, <b>330</b><i>g</i>, and <b>330</b><i>b </i>(gap between pixel regions), a light shielding layer (in the embodiment, a black color filter) <b>330</b>BM for preventing leak of light between pixels is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A gap adjusting section <b>340</b> made of an optically transmissive material is formed on the color filters <b>330</b><i>r</i>, <b>330</b><i>g</i>, and <b>330</b><i>b </i>in order to set the thickness (cell gap) dr of the liquid crystal layer in the region of the pixel opposing the reflective region <b>220</b> to be smaller than the thickness (cell gap) dt of the liquid crystal layer in the transmissive region <b>210</b> (that is, dr&#x3c;dt). The thickness of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> corresponds to a case in which the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer required for obtaining optimum transmittance and optimum reflectance in the transmissive region <b>210</b> in which the incident light is transmitted through the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> once and in the reflective region <b>220</b> in which the incident light is transmitted through the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> twice differs from each other. Thus, for example, a thickness d of the liquid crystal layer is determined to obtain an optimum transmittance in the transmissive region <b>210</b> in which no gap adjusting section <b>340</b> is provided and a gap adjusting section <b>340</b> having a desired thickness is formed in the reflective region <b>220</b> to obtain a thickness d of the liquid crystal layer which is smaller than that in the transmissive region <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">An electrode <b>320</b> common to the plurality of pixels (common electrode) is formed as a second electrode covering the entire surface of the second substrate <b>300</b> including the gap adjusting section <b>340</b>. Similar to the pixel electrode <b>200</b>, a transparent conductive metal oxide such as ITO and IZO can be used to form the common electrode <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the present embodiment, a projection <b>510</b> is formed above the common electrode <b>300</b> as the alignment controller <b>500</b> for dividing the alignment direction of the liquid crystal within a pixel region to form a plurality of region having different alignment directions. The projection <b>510</b> projects toward the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> and may be conductive or insulating. In the present embodiment, an acrylic resin, for example, which is insulating can be used and formed into a desired pattern. In addition, the projection <b>510</b> is formed both in the transmissive region <b>210</b> and the reflective region <b>220</b> within each pixel region.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An alignment film <b>260</b> which is of vertical alignment type similar to the alignment film on the first substrate side and which is rubbingless is formed covering the projection <b>510</b> and the common electrode <b>320</b>. As described, the alignment film <b>260</b> aligns the liquid crystal along a direction perpendicular to the planar direction of the film. In positions covering the projection <b>510</b>, an inclined surface reflecting the shape of the projection <b>510</b> is formed, and, therefore, in the formation positions of the projection <b>510</b>, the liquid crystal is aligned along a direction perpendicular to the inclined surface of the alignment film <b>260</b> covering the projection <b>510</b>, and, thus, the alignment direction of the liquid crystal is divided with the boundary at the projection <b>510</b>. In addition, in the present embodiment, a side surface of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> provided on the side of the second substrate is formed in a tapered shape so that an inclined surface is formed on the alignment film <b>260</b> covering above the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> reflecting the inclined surface of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b>. In this inclined surface also, the liquid crystal is controlled in a direction perpendicular to the inclined surface and the inclined surface of the gap adjusting layer <b>340</b> also functions as the alignment controller <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the transflective LCD shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a linear polarizer plate (first polarizer plate) <b>112</b> and a wide wavelength band quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate (first phase difference plate) <b>111</b> made of a combination of a quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) phase difference plate and a half wavelength (&#x3bb;/2) phase difference plate are provided on the external side (side facing a light source <b>600</b>) of the first substrate so that a wide wavelength band circular polarizer plate <b>110</b> is formed by the linear polarizer plate <b>112</b> and the phase difference plate <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">On the external side (viewing side) of the second substrate <b>300</b>, a phase difference plate <b>310</b> having a negative refractive index anisotropy is provided as an optical compensation plate, and a wide wavelength band quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate (second phase difference plate) <b>111</b> made of a combination of a quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate and a half wavelength (&#x3bb;/2) plate and a linear polarizer plate (second polarizer plate) <b>112</b> are provided so that a wide band circular polarizer plate <b>110</b> is formed by the linear polarizer plate <b>112</b> and the phase difference plate <b>111</b>, similar to the structure on the first substrate side. The positional relationship among the optical members is, for example, as shown in the lower section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in which an axis of the first polarizer plate is placed at 45 degrees, a phase delaying axis of the first quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate is placed at 90 degrees, a phase delaying axis of the second quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate is placed at 180 degrees, and an axis of the second polarizer plate is placed at 135 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Light emitted from the light source <b>600</b> transmits through the linear polarizer plate <b>112</b> on the side of the first substrate <b>100</b> and becomes linearly polarized light in a direction along the polarization axis of the polarizer plate <b>112</b>. The light then becomes circularly polarized light when the phase difference is shifted by &#x3bb;/4 in the first quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate <b>111</b>. In the present embodiment, in order to reliably obtain circular polarization for any of the R, G, and B components at least having different wavelengths to increase the usage efficiency (transmittance) of light in the liquid crystal cell, both a quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) phase plate and a half wavelength (&#x3bb;/2) phase plate are used to form the wide wavelength band quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate <b>111</b>. The obtained circularly polarized light transmits through the pixel electrode <b>200</b> in the transmissive region <b>210</b> and enters the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the transflective LCD according to the present embodiment, vertical alignment liquid crystal having a negative dielectric constant anisotropy (&#x394;&#x2208;&#x3c;0) is used in the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> and the alignment film <b>260</b> of a vertical alignment type is used.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Therefore, in a state in which no voltage is applied, the liquid crystal is aligned along a direction perpendicular to the planar direction of the alignment film <b>260</b>, and, as the applied voltage increases, the direction of the major axis of the liquid crystal is tilted to be perpendicular to an electric field formed between the pixel electrode <b>200</b> and the common electrode <b>320</b> (parallel to the planar direction of the substrate). When no voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b>, the polarization state is not changed in the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b>, the circularly polarized light reaches the second substrate <b>300</b>, the circular polarization is removed by the second quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate <b>111</b>, and the light becomes linearly polarized light. Because the second polarizer plate <b>112</b> is placed perpendicular to the direction of the linear polarization from the second quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate <b>111</b>, the linearly polarized light cannot transmit through the second polarizer plate <b>112</b> having a transmission axis (polarization axis) which is perpendicular to that of the first polarizer plate <b>112</b>, and, thus, the display becomes black.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When a voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b>, the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> creates a phase difference with respect to the incident circularly polarized light to change the polarization, for example, to circular polarization of opposite revolution, an elliptical polarization, and linear polarization. Then, the second quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate <b>111</b> shifts the obtained light by a phase of &#x3bb;/4 so that the polarization becomes linear polarization (parallel to the transmission axis of the second polarizer plate), elliptical polarization, and circular polarization. Because these polarizations each has a component along the polarization axis of the second polarizer plate <b>112</b>, light of an amount corresponding to the component is emitted through the second polarizer plate <b>112</b> toward the viewing side and is recognized as the display (white or grayscale).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The phase difference plate <b>310</b> is a negative retarder which can improve the optical characteristic when the LCD is seen from a tilted angle and can improve the viewing angle. Alternatively, it is also possible to employ a biaxial phase difference plate having both functions of the negative retarder (<b>310</b>) and the quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate <b>111</b> in place of the negative retarder <b>310</b> and the quarter wavelength (&#x3bb;/4) plate <b>111</b>. With this configuration, it is possible to reduce the thickness of the LCD and to improve the transmittance.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the present embodiment, with the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> as described above, the thickness (cell gap) d of the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> which substantially controls the transmittance of light is set to different desired gaps in the transmissive region <b>210</b> and the reflective region <b>220</b>. A primary reason for employing this structure is that the numbers of transmission of light through the liquid crystal layer differ between the transmissive region <b>210</b> and in the reflective region <b>220</b> because in the transmissive region <b>210</b>, display is realized by controlling an amount (transmittance) of light transmitted from the light source <b>600</b> provided on the backside of the LCD (on the side of the first substrate <b>100</b> in the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) through the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> and emitted from the side of the second substrate <b>300</b> to the outside, whereas in the reflective region <b>220</b>, the display is realized by controlling an amount (reflectance of the LCD) of light incident from the viewing side of the LCD on the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b>, reflected by a reflective film formed in the formation region of the pixel electrode <b>200</b>, transmitted through the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> again, and emitted to the viewing side from the side of the second substrate <b>300</b>. In other words, in the reflective region <b>220</b>, the light transmits through the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> twice, and, therefore, the cell gap dr of the reflective region <b>220</b> must be set to a smaller value than the cell gap dt of the transmissive region <b>210</b>. In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> having a desired thickness is provided only in the reflective region <b>220</b> of each pixel in order to achieve the relationship of dr&#x3c;dt. A material of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> is not limited as long as the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> transmits light and can be formed in a desired thickness, and, for example, an acrylic resin or the like which is used also as a planarizing insulating layer may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the side surface of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> is used as a part of the alignment controller <b>500</b> (inclined section <b>520</b>) as described, the taper angle of the side surface of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> must be less than 90 degrees with respect to the plane of the substrate. When the taper angle is 90 degrees or higher, the alignment of the liquid crystal is disturbed at the side surface of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b>, and the coverage of the common electrode <b>320</b> and the alignment film <b>260</b> formed above the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> becomes insufficient. In addition, the side surface of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> does not contribute to display itself. When the taper angle is too small, the area of the side surface of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> becomes large, resulting in a reduction of the aperture ratio of the pixel, in particular, the aperture ratio of the reflective region in which a further improvement in the brightness is desired. Therefore, the taper angle of the side surface of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> is preferably at an angle which does not reduce the coverage of the second electrode <b>320</b> and the alignment film <b>260</b> at the upper layers, which can divide the alignment of the liquid crystal, and which has a small reduction of the aperture ratio. Specifically, the taper angle is preferably within a range of 30 degrees-80 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> having an inclined section <b>520</b> with a taper angle in such a range, it is possible to use, for example, the acrylic resin as described above, with a photosensitive agent. By adjusting the amount of polymerization starter and optically polymerizing monomer to be added to the acrylic resin as the gap adjusting material corresponding to the manufacturing conditions and characteristics of the exposure device, it is possible to obtain an arbitrary forward taper angle. As an alternative method of obtaining a forward tapered side surface for the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> other than the method of adjusting the amount of contained material, it is also possible to, for example, use optical polymerization inhibiting effect by oxygen present in the surroundings, enlargement of a pattern by diffraction of light during the exposure, melt flow by resin baking, etc., or a combination of these methods, to obtain a forward taper of a desired angle.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The optical polymerization inhibiting effect is obtained by oxygen in the atmosphere near the surface of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b>. In contrast, at the side of the substrate away from the surface, the amount of oxygen is small, and, thus, polymerization is not inhibited and a hardening process proceeds. Therefore, the side of the surface of the planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b> is easier to be removed during development, resulting in a forward taper having a narrower width as the distance from the substrate increases.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The diffraction of light at the exposure depends on the exposure device. In a proximity exposure device, for example, the fact that the diffraction is large is utilized to form a taper in the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> by a region in which the gap adjusting section is formed and a region in which the gap adjusting section is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the melt flow, after the development, the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> is baked, for example, at a temperature of 80&#xb0; C.-180&#xb0; C. for 1 min. to 20 min. (for example, 120&#xb0; C. and 8 min.) to melt the upper surface and side surface of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> so that the surface is smoothened and a forward taper is formed by the side surface being melted and a shape change depending on the surface tension of the material.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As an organic material used in the gap adjusting section, materials are known which show sensitivity to a g ray (436 nm), h ray (405 nm), and i ray (248 nm) of an exposure light source. Many of organic materials showing sensitivity to the i ray result in a taper angle of 90 degrees or higher (reverse taper). In consideration of this, in the present embodiment, an acrylic resin having a sensitivity to the g ray and h ray and which tends to result in a forward taper is used as the material of the gap adjusting section.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition to changing the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer between the transmissive region <b>210</b> and the reflective region <b>220</b> in a pixel region, in the present embodiment, the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer is changed among the pixels for R, G, and B having different wavelengths (however, a common gap may be employed for red, green, and blue depending on the characteristics of the LCD). In the illustrated structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the gap for all of red, green, and blue is realized by changing the thicknesses of the red color filter <b>330</b><i>r</i>, green color filter <b>330</b><i>g</i>, and blue color filter <b>330</b><i>b </i>which are formed on the side of the second substrate <b>300</b>. The present embodiment is not limited to a structure in which the thickness of the color filter is changed, and it is also possible to provide the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> also in the transmissive region <b>210</b> with the thickness of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> being different in the transmissive region <b>210</b> and reflective region <b>220</b> for red, green, and blue. The present invention is not limited to a structure in which the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer in all of red, green, and blue differs from each other, and it is also possible to employ a configuration, for example, in which the green and blue pixels have the same thickness of the liquid crystal layer and only the red pixel has a different thickness, or a configuration in which only the blue pixel has a different thickness d, depending on the characteristics of the LCD.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows another structure for obtaining a different gap among pixels for red, green, and blue (in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the structures common to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will not be described again). In the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the gaps for red, green, and blue are not changed at the second substrate side, but rather, the thickness of the planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b> which is formed below the pixel electrode <b>200</b> is adjusted for red, green, and blue at the side of the first substrate <b>100</b>. As a method for changing the thickness of the planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b>, for example, it is possible to form the planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b> with different thicknesses for pixels for red, green, and blue without adding an extra step by exposing a planarizing insulating material containing a photosensitive material using one or a plurality of half-exposure mask having an amount of opening corresponding to the target thickness. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, projections and depressions are formed on the surface of the planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b> in the reflective region. The projections and depressions on the surface of the planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b> can be transferred to the reflective layer <b>44</b> formed on the planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b> in the reflective region so that projections and depressions are created on the surface of the reflective layer <b>44</b> to scatter the light incident on the liquid crystal layer to improve the display quality in the reflective region. Similar to the above-described process to obtain different thicknesses of planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b> in red, green, and blue, it is possible to employ the half-exposure to form the projections and depressions on the planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b> in the reflective region and a contact hole to be formed through the planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b> for connecting the pixel electrode <b>200</b> and the TFT simultaneously with formation of the planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b> without adding a step.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, a more specific structure of each pixel of the transflective LCD according to the present embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically shows an example planar structure of a transflective LCD according to the present embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> schematically shows a cross sectional structure along the A-A&#x2032; line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically shows a cross sectional structure along the B-B&#x2032; line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a more specific structure of the pixel electrode <b>200</b> and the thin film transistor or the like connected to the pixel electrode <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the planar structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a pixel electrode <b>200</b> formed in an individual pattern for each pixel has a hexagonal pattern elongated along the vertical scan direction of the screen (vertical direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a reflective film is selectively formed in a quadrangular (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, rhombus-shaped or square-shaped) region surrounded by diagonal lines including two upper sides in the longitudinal direction to form a reflective region <b>220</b>. The remaining region of the hexagonal pixel electrode <b>200</b> having a chevron shape forms the transmissive region <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the reflective region <b>220</b>, a gap adjusting layer <b>340</b> is formed above the second substrate <b>300</b>, above the common electrode <b>320</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in order to set the thickness (cell gap) dr of the liquid crystal layer to be smaller than the gap dt in the transmissive region <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">An end of the gap adjusting layer <b>340</b> within a pixel is placed at a position along two lower sides of the quadrangular reflective region <b>220</b> which are almost linearly symmetrical with the two upper sides of the hexagonal pixel electrode <b>200</b>. In addition, a projection <b>510</b><i>r </i>having a triangular cross section is formed connecting vertices of the quadrangular reflective region <b>220</b> opposing along the horizontal scan direction (horizontal direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and above the second substrate <b>300</b> (more specifically, above the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to divide the reflective region <b>220</b> into an upper region and a lower region along the horizontal scan direction.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 8</figref>, the edge at the end of the gap adjusting section is provided outside a center in a line width direction of the linear alignment controller, and an inclined surface at the end of the gap adjusting section overlaps a formation region of the linear alignment controller at a location outward from the center such that the inclined surface does not overlap the center of the alignment controller.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an entire surface of the second substrate <b>300</b> including the projection <b>510</b> and the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> is covered by a vertical alignment film <b>260</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. In addition, a vertical alignment film <b>260</b> is formed over the entire surface of the first substrate <b>100</b> including the pixel electrode <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Therefore, when no voltage is applied between the pixel electrode <b>200</b> and the common electrode <b>320</b>, a major axis direction <b>410</b> of the liquid crystal (liquid crystal director) is aligned perpendicular to the planar direction of the vertical alignment film <b>260</b>. Therefore, on the projection <b>510</b> and the inclined surface of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> at the side of the second substrate <b>300</b>, the liquid crystal director <b>410</b> is aligned perpendicular to the inclined surface of the alignment film <b>260</b> which is formed on the surface facing the liquid crystal with the inclined surface transferred. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, regions having alignment direction (alignment orientation, azimuth) of liquid crystal different from each other by 180 degrees are formed with the projection <b>510</b><i>r </i>as a boundary, the projection <b>510</b><i>r </i>being at the position to divide the reflective region <b>220</b> into upper and lower regions.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the transmissive region <b>210</b> having a chevron shape (a shape of a pair of the shaft feather), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, a projection <b>510</b><i>t </i>having a triangular cross section is formed on the side of the second substrate <b>300</b>, more specifically, on the common electrode <b>320</b> at a position (a position corresponding to a core of the chevron) dividing the pixel electrode <b>200</b> having a hexagonal shape elongated along the vertical scan direction into equal parts along the vertical scan direction into right and left regions (horizontal scan direction). Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, vertical alignment films <b>260</b> are formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> on surfaces contacting the liquid crystal on the side of the second substrate <b>300</b> and on the side of the first substrate <b>100</b>. In the transmissive region <b>210</b>, the alignment direction (alignment orientation) of the liquid crystal director <b>410</b> is divided into directions which differ from each other by 180 degrees at the projection <b>510</b><i>t </i>formed on the second substrate as a boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In addition, in the present embodiment, in addition to the projection and inclined surface as described above, an electrode absent section <b>530</b> is also used as the alignment controller <b>500</b>. In the illustrated structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, a gap portion between a plurality of pixel electrodes <b>200</b> formed on the side of the first substrate <b>100</b> is used as an electrode absent section <b>530</b> for controlling the alignment. The alignment division by the electrode absent section <b>530</b> takes advantage of a slope of a weak electric field when a voltage starts to be applied between the pixel electrode <b>200</b> and the common electrode <b>320</b>. Under the weak electric field, the electric field lines shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> by a dotted line are tilted in a tilted angle spreading from the end of the electrode absent section, that is, from the end of the electrode toward the center of the electrode absent section. Because a minor axis of the liquid crystal having a negative dielectric constant anisotropy is aligned along the tilted electric field line, the direction in which the liquid crystal molecules are tilted from the initial vertically aligned state as the applied voltage to the liquid crystal increases is defined by the tilted electric field.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The hexagonal pixel electrode <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has the electrode absent section <b>530</b> at the ends of the pixel electrode <b>200</b>. That is, at least six sides of electrode absent section <b>530</b> are present. Therefore, because of the actions of the projection <b>510</b> (<b>510</b><i>r </i>and <b>510</b><i>t</i>), the inclined surface <b>520</b>, and the electrode absent section <b>530</b> on the periphery of the pixel electrode <b>200</b>, a total of four regions are formed having different alignment directions of the liquid crystal director <b>410</b> within one pixel region, at least two alignment regions in the reflective region <b>220</b> and two alignment regions in the transmissive region <b>210</b> within one pixel region, each having a different alignment direction from either of the two regions of the reflective region <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">More accurately, the liquid crystal director <b>410</b> is controlled so that its planar component (alignment direction) is perpendicular to the extension direction of the projection <b>510</b> and the extension direction of the edge of the electrode (electrode absent section). Therefore, in any of the four alignment regions, the alignment direction of the liquid crystal is not completely identical throughout the region. For example, on the central position of the transmissive region <b>210</b> along the vertical scan direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the liquid crystal director <b>410</b> is aligned in a direction perpendicular to the projection <b>510</b><i>t </i>and the edge of the pixel electrode <b>200</b> extending along the vertical scan direction. However, at the boundary of the transmissive region <b>210</b>, for example, with the reflective region <b>220</b>, the inclined surface (projection) <b>520</b> by the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> and the projection <b>510</b><i>t </i>of the transmissive region <b>210</b> intersect each other at an angle of greater than 90 degrees. Therefore, the alignment direction of the liquid crystal around the intersection changes from a direction perpendicular to the extension direction of the projection <b>510</b> to a direction perpendicular to the extension direction of the inclined section <b>520</b> as the position becomes closer to the inclined section <b>520</b> by the gap adjusting section <b>340</b>. However, as will be described later, in one alignment region, the extension direction of the alignment controller <b>500</b> is set to minimize a degree of change (or maximum angle) of the alignment direction of the liquid crystal based on the position so that generation of a boundary (disclination line) of regions having different alignment directions of liquid crystal at an uncertain position within one alignment region is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A relationship between the extension direction of the alignment controller <b>500</b> and the alignment direction of the liquid crystal in each position within one pixel region according to the present embodiment will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">An angular difference between the alignment direction of the liquid crystal controlled by the projection <b>510</b><i>t </i>of the transmissive region <b>210</b> and the alignment direction of the liquid crystal controlled by the inclined section <b>520</b> of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> intersecting the projection <b>510</b><i>t </i>is less than 90 degrees because the top and bottom of the liquid crystal molecule along the major axis direction do not have an optical characteristic difference. In the illustrated structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the intersecting angle between the projection <b>510</b> and the projection <b>520</b> by the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> is approximately 135 degrees whereas the difference in the alignment directions of the liquid crystal is 45 degrees. In this description, although the projection <b>510</b><i>t </i>and the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> are described to intersect each other, in some cases, the projection <b>510</b> and the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> may not physically intersect each other. Therefore, in this description, the term &#x201c;intersect&#x201d; refers to intersection of extended lines of two lines, and, when the two structures are provided on different substrates, intersection of projection lines of the extended lines to the plane of the same substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The angle of intersection of the inclined section <b>520</b> by the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> and a side of the pixel electrode <b>200</b> of the transmissive region <b>210</b> (in reality, the angle of intersection of projection lines to the plane of the same substrate because the inclined surface <b>520</b> and the pixel electrode <b>200</b> are not formed on the same substrate) is approximately 45 degrees in the illustrated structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. An angle between the alignment direction of the liquid crystal controlled by the inclined section <b>520</b> and the alignment direction of the liquid crystal controlled by the edge of the pixel electrode <b>200</b> is 90 degrees or smaller, and, in this configuration, is less than 45 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The intersection angle on the projection lines to the plane of the substrate of the projection <b>510</b><i>t </i>and the edge of the pixel electrode <b>200</b> near the lower end of the transmissive region <b>210</b> is 45 degrees in this structure and a difference of alignment direction of the liquid crystal near the intersection is less than 90 degrees and is 45 degrees or smaller in this structure because the top and bottom of the liquid crystal molecule do not have a characteristic difference, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The transmissive region <b>210</b> further has a region in which the sides of the pixel electrode <b>200</b> intersect each other.

The difference of the alignment direction of liquid crystal at the intersection is less than 90 degrees and is 45 degrees because the top and bottom of the liquid crystal molecule do not have a characteristic difference.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Similarly, in the reflective region <b>220</b>, the alignment controllers <b>500</b> are provided such that a difference in the alignment direction of the liquid crystal is less than 90 degrees in a region in which a projection line of an alignment controller <b>500</b> to the plane of the substrate (including the extended line) and a projection line of another alignment controller <b>500</b> to the plane of the substrate (including the extend line) intersect each other. That is, a projection <b>510</b><i>r </i>which divides the reflective region <b>220</b> into upper and lower regions having different alignment directions and the inclined section <b>520</b> by the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> which intersects at the end of the pixel electrode <b>200</b> intersect each other at an angle of less than 90 degrees and the angular difference of the alignment directions of the liquid crystal in the intersection region is controlled to be 45 degrees or less which is less than 90 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">An intersection angle between the projection <b>510</b><i>r </i>and the edge of the pixel electrode <b>200</b> in the reflective region <b>220</b> (intersection angle of projection lines to the plane of the substrate) is also less than 90 degrees, and the angular difference between the alignment directions of the liquid crystal in the intersection is also controlled to be 45 degrees or less which is less than 90 degrees.</p>

In this manner, generation of a disclination line in an uncertain position within a region divided by the alignment controller <b>500</b> is reliably prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">At the position in the reflective region <b>220</b> in which the sides of the pixel electrode <b>200</b> intersect each other (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, near a vertex at the uppermost section of the pixel electrode <b>200</b> along the vertical scan direction) and the intersection between the inclined sections <b>520</b> by the gap adjusting sections <b>340</b> (around the bend of the &#x201c;V&#x201d; shape), the angles of intersection are both 90 degrees in the illustrated structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. From the above-described view point, these intersection angles are preferably less than 90 degrees or greater than 90 degrees, but because the area of the reflective region <b>220</b> having a rhombus shape is small compared to the transmissive region, generation of a disclination line at an uncertain position is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The liquid crystal in the reflective region <b>220</b> is more strongly affected by the alignment control by the projection <b>510</b><i>r</i>, inclined section <b>520</b>, and the side of the pixel electrode <b>200</b>.

However, the liquid crystal is controlled equally by the nearby alignment controllers <b>500</b>, and, the planar component of the liquid crystal director <b>410</b> at this position becomes a direction along the vertical scan direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, because of influences of both continuation with the liquid crystal controlled along a direction perpendicular to the extension direction of the projection <b>510</b><i>r</i>.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the present embodiment, a top gate TFT is employed as the TFT and polycrystalline silicon (p-Si) obtained by polycrystallizing amorphous silicon (a-Si) by laser annealing is used as an active layer <b>20</b>. The TFT is not limited to a top gate TFT with p-Si, and a bottom gate TFT or a TFT in which a-Si is used in the active layer may alternatively be used. Impurities to be doped into the source and drain regions <b>20</b><i>s </i>and <b>20</b><i>d </i>of the active layer <b>20</b> of the TFT may be of an n-conductive type or a p-conductive type. In the present embodiment, an n-conductive impurity such as phosphorus is doped, and, thus, an n-ch TFT is used.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The active layer <b>20</b> of the TFT is covered by an gate insulating film <b>30</b> and a gate electrode <b>32</b> which is made of a refractory metal such as Cr and Mo and which also functions as a gate line is formed on the gate insulating film <b>30</b>. After the gate electrode <b>32</b> is formed, the above-described impurity is doped into the active layer <b>20</b> using the gate electrode <b>32</b> as a mask to form the source region <b>20</b><i>s</i>, drain region <b>20</b><i>d</i>, and a channel region <b>20</b><i>c </i>which is not doped with the impurity. Then, an interlayer insulating film <b>34</b> is formed covering the entire surface of the TFT <b>110</b>, contact holes are formed through the interlayer insulating film <b>34</b>, and a layer of an electrode material is formed so that a source electrode <b>40</b> is connected to the source region <b>20</b><i>s </i>of the p-Si active layer <b>20</b> and a drain electrode <b>36</b> is connected to the drain region <b>20</b><i>d </i>of the p-Si active layer <b>20</b> through the contact holes. In the present embodiment, the drain electrode <b>36</b> also functions as a data line for supplying a data signal corresponding to the display content to the TFT <b>110</b>. The source electrode <b>40</b>, on the other hand, is connected to the first electrode <b>200</b> which is the pixel electrode as will be described later. As the drain electrode <b>36</b> and the source electrode <b>40</b>, a highly conductive material such as Al is used.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">After the source electrode <b>40</b> and the drain electrode <b>36</b> are formed, a planarizing insulating film <b>38</b> made of a resin material such as an acrylic resin is formed covering the entire surface of the substrate. Then, a contract hole is formed through the planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b> at a formation region of the source electrode <b>40</b>, a connection metal layer <b>42</b> is formed in the contact hole, and the source electrode <b>40</b> and the metal layer <b>42</b> are connected. When Al or the like is used as the source electrode <b>40</b>, it is possible to achieve superior ohmic contact between the source electrode <b>40</b> and the metal layer <b>42</b> using a metal material such as Mo as the metal layer <b>42</b>. The source electrode <b>40</b> may be omitted, and, in this case, the metal layer <b>42</b> directly contacts the silicon active layer <b>20</b> of the TFT <b>110</b>. The metal such as Mo can establish ohmic contact with such a semiconductor material.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">After the connection metal layer is layered and patterned, an Al&#x2014;Nd alloy for a reflective layer or a reflective material layer such as Al having a superior reflective characteristic is layered on the entire surface of the substrate through evaporation or sputtering. The layered reflective material layer is etched and removed in a region near the source region of the TFT (formation region of the metal layer <b>42</b>) so that the reflective material layer does not block the contact between the metal layer <b>42</b> and the TFT and the pixel electrode <b>200</b> to be formed later than the reflective material layer, and, at the same time, etched and removed so that the reflective material layer is not present in the transmissive region and a reflective layer <b>44</b> having an outer shape of rhombus is formed in the reflective region <b>220</b> of each pixel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the present embodiment, in order to prevent generation of a leak current by irradiation of light to the TFT (in particular, the channel region <b>20</b><i>c</i>) and to widen the region which can reflect (that is, the display region) as much as possible, the reflective layer <b>44</b> is intentionally formed also above the channel region of the TFT <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the patterning of the reflective layer <b>44</b> as described, the metal layer <b>42</b> made of Mo or the like has a sufficient thickness (for example, 0.2 &#x3bc;m) and has a sufficient endurance to the etching solution. Therefore, even after the reflective layer <b>44</b> on the metal layer <b>42</b> is removed through etching, the metal layer <b>42</b> is not completely removed and remains in the contact hole. Because the source electrode <b>40</b> or the like is formed by a material similar to the reflective layer <b>44</b> (Al or the like), if the metal layer <b>42</b> is not present, the source electrode <b>40</b> would be corroded by the etching solution of the reflective layer <b>44</b>, resulting in disconnection or the like. By providing a metal layer <b>42</b> as in the present embodiment, it is possible to endure the patterning process of the reflective layer <b>44</b> and to maintain superior electrical connection between the metal layer <b>42</b> and the source electrode <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">After the reflective layer <b>44</b> is patterned, a transparent conductive layer is layered covering the entire surface of the substrate including the reflective layer <b>44</b> through sputtering. In this process, the surface of the reflective layer <b>44</b> made of Al or the like as described is covered by a natural oxide film which is insulating, but the surface of the refractory metal such as Mo is not oxidized even when the refractory metal is exposed to the sputtering atmosphere. Therefore, the metal layer <b>42</b> exposed in the contact region can form an ohmic contact with the transparent conductive layer for the pixel electrode layered on the metal layer <b>42</b>. After the transparent conductive layer is formed, the transparent conductive layer is patterned into a shape independent for each pixel, common to the reflective region and transmissive region within a pixel region, and into an elongated hexagonal shape, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to obtain a pixel electrode <b>200</b>. After the pixel electrode <b>200</b> is formed through patterning, an alignment film <b>260</b> made of polyimide or the like is formed covering the entire surface of the substrate and the first substrate side is completed. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the second substrate <b>300</b> on which the red, green, and blue color filter layers, common electrode <b>320</b>, gap adjusting section <b>340</b>, projection <b>510</b> (<b>510</b><i>r </i>and <b>510</b><i>t</i>), and alignment film <b>260</b> covering these structures are formed is adhered with the first substrate <b>100</b> around the periphery of the substrates with a predetermined space therebetween, and the liquid crystal is sealed between the substrates to obtain the LCD.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The common electrode <b>320</b> formed on the side of the second substrate <b>300</b> in the illustrated structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is formed above the gap adjusting layer <b>340</b> and a projection <b>510</b> is formed on the common electrode <b>320</b> at a desired position. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the common electrode <b>320</b> may be formed below the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> (more specifically, between the color filter formed on the second substrate <b>300</b> and the gap adjusting section <b>340</b>). When the thickness of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> is very large, if the common electrode <b>320</b> is formed below the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the effective voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer <b>410</b> is reduced. However, when a sufficiently large voltage is to be applied between the common electrode <b>320</b> and the pixel electrode <b>200</b> or the thickness of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> is not too large, it is possible to employ the configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Next, an alternative configuration of a structure of each pixel in the transflective LCD according to the present embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> schematically shows a planar structure of the transflective LCD according to the alternative configuration and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram schematically showing a cross sectional structure along the C-C&#x2032; line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A schematic cross sectional structure along the D-D&#x2032; line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is identical to the schematic cross sectional structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">A difference from the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is that the shape of the pixel electrode <b>240</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is rectangular and approximate X-shaped projections <b>510</b><i>t </i>and <b>510</b><i>r </i>are formed as the alignment controllers <b>500</b> in the transmissive region <b>210</b> and the reflective <b>220</b>, both of which are quadrangular regions, at positions corresponding to the diagonal lines of the quadrangle. With such alignment controllers <b>500</b>, four regions having different alignment directions of liquid crystal are formed in the transmissive region <b>210</b> and the reflective region <b>220</b> with the projections <b>510</b><i>t </i>and <b>510</b><i>r </i>being the boundaries, and, as a consequence, the viewing angle is further widened.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">At the boundary of the transmissive region <b>210</b> in a pixel region, as described above, an alignment controller <b>500</b> realized by the inclined section <b>520</b> of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> is formed on the side of the second substrate <b>300</b> and an electrode absent section <b>530</b> (slit; window <b>530</b><i>s</i>) extending along the horizontal scan direction along with the inclined section <b>520</b> is provided in the pixel electrode <b>200</b>. Therefore, in the boundary region between the transmissive region <b>210</b> and the reflective region <b>220</b>, the initial alignment of the liquid crystal is controlled by the inclined surface (inclined section <b>520</b>) of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b> at the second substrate side to a direction perpendicular to the inclined surface and is controlled in different directions from each other with the boundary at the electrode absent section <b>530</b><i>s </i>on the first substrate side due to the tilt of the weak electric field as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in the electrode absent section <b>530</b><i>s</i>. Thus, the alignment division of the liquid crystal around the boundary between the transmissive region <b>210</b> and the reflective region <b>220</b> is more reliably realized.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As described, although the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> differs from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in the individual pattern of the alignment controllers <b>500</b> including the edge of the pixel electrode <b>200</b>, the projection <b>510</b>, and the electrode absent section <b>530</b><i>s </i>and in the number of alignment divisions, with the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also, an angular difference between the alignment direction of the liquid crystal controlled by a certain alignment controller <b>500</b> and an alignment direction of the liquid crystal controlled by another alignment controller <b>500</b> having a projection line which intersects the projection line of the alignment controller <b>500</b> onto the plane of the substrate is less than 90 degrees at any intersection. Therefore, it is possible to reliably prevent generation of a disclination line at an uncertain position within any of the divided alignment regions. In addition, by employing a pattern of the alignment controller <b>500</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is possible to achieve a maximum number of alignment division and reliable alignment division with a minimum amount of alignment controllers <b>500</b> formed. In the vertical alignment liquid crystal employed in the present embodiment, when no voltage is applied, that is, in a vertical alignment state, black is displayed. Therefore, in addition to the gap between pixel electrodes <b>200</b> not contributing to the display, even when a sufficient voltage is applied between the common electrode <b>320</b> and the pixel electrode <b>200</b>, the alignment state of the liquid crystal at positions directly above the other alignment controllers <b>500</b> (projection <b>510</b>, inclined section <b>520</b>, and slit <b>530</b><i>s</i>) does not significantly change, and the liquid crystal above at these positions does not contribute to the display. Therefore, placement of redundant alignment controllers <b>500</b> would reduce the aperture ratio of the LCD. However, by employing layouts as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>, it is possible to widen the viewing angle and improve the display quality while inhibiting the reduction in the aperture ratio to a minimum degree.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> show other alternative configurations of the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the pixel electrode <b>250</b> has an overall shape of a chevron. The shape and the structure of the reflective region <b>220</b> is identical to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, the pattern of the remaining transmissive region <b>210</b> differs from that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in that the shape is a lateral enveloping shape, a shape of an laterally placed hourglass, or a shape in which M and W are connected to each other along the vertical direction. The projection line of the projection <b>510</b><i>t </i>onto the plane intersects, at an angle of greater than 90 degrees (in the illustrated structure, 135 degrees), two sides of the pixel electrode <b>250</b> in the transmissive region <b>210</b> having the projection lines to the plane intersecting each other. Because the top and the bottom of the liquid crystal molecules do not have an optical characteristic difference along the major axis direction as described above, the angle difference between alignment directions of the liquid crystal in the intersection region is again less than 90 degrees. In addition, an intersection angle between two lower sides of the pixel electrode <b>250</b> extending from the intersection position with the projection <b>510</b><i>t </i>toward the lower end of two sides of the pixel electrode <b>250</b> extending along the vertical scan direction and the side of the pixel electrode <b>250</b> along the vertical scan direction is less than 90 degrees, and the maximum difference in the alignment directions of the liquid crystal in this region is also less than 90 degrees (in the illustrated structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, less than 45 degrees). Therefore, in two alignment regions within the transmissive region <b>210</b> also, generation of a disclination line at an uncertain position is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the pixel electrode <b>252</b> has a chevron shape. The shape (chevron shape) and structure of the transmissive region <b>210</b> are identical to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The shape of the remaining reflective region <b>220</b> of the pixel electrode <b>252</b> having a chevron shape and the formation position of the projection <b>510</b><i>r </i>which divides the alignment of the liquid crystal within the reflective region <b>220</b> differ from those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. More specifically, in the illustrated structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the reflective region <b>220</b> also has a chevron shape with a short height and, at the boundary between the reflective region <b>220</b> and the transmissive region <b>210</b>, the alignment is divided by a V-shaped inclined section <b>520</b> of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b>. A projection <b>510</b><i>r </i>is formed on the side of the second substrate (above the gap adjusting section) on a line along the vertical scan direction and connecting the vertex of the V-shape of the inclined section <b>520</b> and a vertex of a similar V-shape of the pixel electrode <b>252</b> in the reflective region <b>220</b>. Two alignment regions are formed in the reflective region <b>220</b> on left and right of the projection <b>510</b><i>r </i>along the horizontal scan direction with the projection <b>510</b><i>r </i>being the boundary. With such a structure also, an angular difference between an alignment direction of the liquid crystal controlled by an alignment controller <b>500</b> and an alignment direction of the liquid crystal controlled by another alignment controller <b>500</b> having a projection line intersecting a projection line of the alignment controller <b>500</b> onto the plane of the substrate satisfies the condition of being less than 90 degrees, and thus, a superior alignment division is realized.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Next, a drive voltage, transmittance, and wavelength dependencies of the drive voltage and transmittance in the vertical alignment transflective LCD according to the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a relationship between an applied voltage (V) and transmittance (arbitrary unit) in liquid crystal, and shows an optical characteristic of the vertical alignment liquid crystal cell, that is, relationship between the applied voltage and the transmittance when the cell structure is changed, represented by an expression (del&#x2212;n)d/wl (expression (i)).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, wl is set to 550 nm (green). In the expression (i), the term (del&#x2212;n) represents a birefringence (that is, refractive index anisotropy) (&#x394;n) of the liquid crystal layer, d represents a thickness (cell gap) of the liquid crystal layer, and wl represents a wavelength of the incident light. In a small LCD or the like which is equipped in a portable device such as a portable phone, a further reduction in the power consumption and further reduction in the drive voltage are desired. As can be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in a cell having a value of, for example, 1.0 for the above-described expression (i), the applied voltage may be approximately 3 V for achieving a maximum transmittance and that when the value of the expression (i) is increased to 1.1 and 1.2, for example, the applied voltage can be reduced to less than 3 V. By finely adjusting the value of d, it is possible to drive at a sufficiently low voltage even when a same liquid crystal material and a same light source is used. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the value of d can be adjusted with a thickness of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b>, color filter <b>330</b>, and planarizing insulating layer <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As can be understood by the term of &#x201c;wl&#x201d; in expression (i), in the LCD of the present embodiment, the transmittance characteristic has a wavelength dependency. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, when the thickness (cell gap) d of the liquid crystal layer is set to a constant for all of pixels for red, green, and blue, the transmittance characteristic with respect to the applied voltage differs for light of red (630 nm), green (550 nm), and blue (460 nm). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, on the other hand, shows a relationship between the applied voltage and transmittance in an LCD in which the value of the cell gap d is adjusted by changing the thickness for each of red, green, and blue by changing, for example, the thickness of the color filters <b>330</b><i>r</i>, <b>330</b><i>g</i>, and <b>330</b><i>b </i>(alternatively, the cell gap may be adjusted by adjusting the thickness of the gap adjusting section <b>340</b>). As can be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, by setting the cell gap d to a desired value for each of red, green, and blue, it is possible to set the transmittance characteristic with respect to the applied voltage to the same characteristic in each pixel corresponding to light of red, green, and blue. Therefore, it is clear that, by employing such a structure, it is possible to drive the LCD by an applied voltage of less than 3 V as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and drive red, green, and blue pixels by display signals having the same amplitude.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> show an applied voltage dependency of chromaticity (X-Y coordinates of CIE). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a change in the chromaticity when the voltage to be applied to the liquid crystal is changed from 1.5 V to 2.0 V, 2.3 V, 2.6 V, and 3.0 V in an LCD with a same cell gap in red, green, and blue as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a change in the chromaticity when the voltage to be applied is changed from 1.5 V to 2.0 V, 2.3 V, 2.6 V, and 3.0 V in an LCD having the cell gap adjusted for red, green, and blue so that there is no color dependency of the transmittance change with respect to the applied voltage. As can be understood from a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, by adjusting the cell gap in red, green, and blue, it is possible to improve the applied voltage dependency of the chromaticity, that is, the shift in chromaticity when the applied voltage is changed, and thus, to realize an LCD having a small color shift even when the LCD is driven by a voltage in various voltage ranges.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">A second preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described which is a configuration for improving a display quality in color display. In the below description, color display on a vertical alignment liquid crystal display device is exemplified.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">A vertical alignment liquid crystal display device has a wide viewing angle characteristic and a high contrast characteristic, and has an advantage that no rubbing process of the alignment film is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the vertical alignment liquid crystal display device, because the liquid crystal has a negative dielectric constant anisotropy, the liquid crystal molecules forming the liquid crystal has a characteristic that the liquid crystal tends to be directed in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the electric field. In such a liquid crystal display device, a vertical alignment film is employed as the alignment film for controlling the initial alignment of the liquid crystal and an organic material or the like such as, for example, polyimide and polyamide is used as the material of the vertical alignment film. In a vertical alignment liquid crystal display device, the liquid crystal molecules are controlled, by the vertical alignment film, to be directed along a direction of normal of the substrate on which the vertical alignment film is formed when no electric field is applied to the liquid crystal. When a voltage is applied between a pixel electrode and a common electrode to generate an electric field along the direction of normal of the substrate, the liquid crystal molecules in a region sandwiched by the electric fields is tilted to a direction perpendicular to the electric field.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">With this process, the phase of the incident light transmitting through the liquid crystal changes. The phase change of the incident light transmitting through the liquid crystal can be represented as &#x394;nd/&#x3bb; when a distance (gap) between the substrates sandwiching the liquid crystal is d, the dispersion of index of refraction is &#x394;n, and the wavelength of light is &#x3bb;. By allowing the light transmitted through the liquid crystal to transmit through a polarizer plate provided on the substrate, the transmittance of the incident light changes and a desired liquid crystal display is achieved. In this case, for example, the polarizer plate is set so that a black display is achieved when no voltage is applied and the transmittance of incident light is maximized at a certain constant voltage (white voltage Vwhite) when a voltage is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Recently, as vertical alignment liquid crystal display devices, full-color vertical alignment liquid crystal display devices having pixels of three primary colors of red, green, and blue are developed.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In a full-color vertical alignment liquid crystal display device, however, the wavelength &#x3bb; of the light transmitted through the color filters of different colors for pixels of the three primary colors of red, green, and blue differ among pixels, and, thus, the transmittance is not maximized with a constant voltage. In other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>, the V-T characteristic (characteristic curve of applied voltage to the liquid crystal versus the transmittance) differs among the pixels for red, green, and blue. The transmittance T in the V-T characteristic increases as the applied voltage V to the liquid crystal increases and decreases after reaching a maximum. Normally, the white voltage Vwhite is set as the applied voltage V to the liquid crystal based on B (blue) in which the transmittance T reaches a maximum value at the lowest voltage among red, green, and blue.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">When the white voltage Vwhite is applied, in the G (green) and R (red) pixels, the transmittance does not reach 100%, resulting in a problem in that color of white is viewed as a bluish color. Although it is possible to improve the problem of coloring by increasing the applied voltage to the liquid crystal (drive voltage) of the red pixel, with such a configuration, a new problem arises in that the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device increases.</p>

The components identical to those in the first preferred embodiment (in particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are basically assigned the same reference numerals and will not be described again. Although the second preferred embodiment is described exemplifying a transflective LCD in which a transmissive region and a reflective region are provided within each of pixels assigned for display of three primary colors of red, green, and blue so that the display can be seen in a bright environment and in a dark environment, similar to the first preferred embodiment, the present embodiment is not limited to a transflective LCD and may be applied to a transmissive LCD and a reflective LCD having pixels of three primary colors of red, green, and blue.</p>

By selectively providing the gap adjusting layer <b>340</b> in the reflective region, the opposing distance (gap) between the first glass substrate <b>100</b> and the second glass substrate <b>300</b> is set to be smaller in the reflective region than that in the transmissive region, to achieve a superior reflective characteristic (display characteristic in the reflective region).

With this structure, depending on the voltage setting on the pixel electrode and the common electrode <b>214</b>, when no voltage is applied to the liquid crystal <b>400</b>, the incident light to the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b> is not emitted to the outside from the side of the second glass substrate <b>300</b> and black display is achieved, and, when a voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer <b>400</b>, the transmittance of the light emitted from the side of the second substrate <b>300</b> to the outside, that is, the transmittance for the liquid crystal layer, increases based on the applied voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">A characteristic in the second preferred embodiment can be found in the thicknesses of the color filter layers <b>332</b><i>b</i>, <b>332</b><i>g</i>, and <b>332</b><i>r </i>for blue, green, and red. When the thickness of the blue color filter layer <b>332</b><i>b </i>is D-blue, the thickness of the green color filter layer <b>332</b><i>g </i>is D-green, and the thickness of the red color filter layer <b>332</b><i>r </i>is D-red, the thicknesses satisfy a condition of D-blue&#x2267;D-green&#x3e;D-red. The gap (thickness of liquid crystal sandwiched by the substrate) in the transmissive region of pixels for red, green, and blue satisfies a relationship opposite to that of the thicknesses of the color filter layers. That is, when the gap in the transmissive region of blue pixel is G-blue(T), the gap in the transmissive region of green pixel is G-green(T), and the gap in the transmissive region of red pixel is G-red(T), the gaps satisfy a condition of G-red(T)&#x3e;G-green(T)&#x2267;G-blue(T). In this manner, by setting the thicknesses of the blue color filter layer <b>332</b><i>b</i>, green color filter layer <b>332</b><i>g</i>, and red color filter layer <b>332</b><i>r </i>to differ from each other to achieve different gaps (also referred to as &#x201c;cell gap&#x201d;) among the pixels, it is possible to achieve uniform V-T characteristic for pixels for red, green, and blue.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Next, the V-T characteristic of pixels for red, green, and blue will be described based on an experimental result shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A-17C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A-17C</figref>, the horizontal axis represents voltage to be applied to the liquid crystal <b>400</b> and the vertical axis represents transmittance of incident light.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">When D-blue=D-green=D-red (when the thickness of all color filter layers is identical) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>, the V-T characteristic significantly differ among red, green, and blue. When the thicknesses are set to satisfy the condition of D-blue&#x3e;D-green&#x3e;D-red as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, the V-T characteristics of blue and red pixels become closer to the V-T characteristic of the green pixel. When the gap of red, green, and blue are set to G-red (T)=4.8 &#x3bc;m, G-green (T)=4.0 &#x3bc;m, and G-blue (T)=3.3 &#x3bc;m through setting of the thicknesses of the blue color filter layer <b>332</b><i>b</i>, green color filter layer <b>332</b><i>g</i>, and red color filter layer <b>332</b><i>r</i>, the V-T characteristic can be set almost identical for red, green, and blue. With this configuration, it is possible to select a suitable white voltage Vwhite (for example, a voltage V in which the transmittance is maximized) to realize display driven by a low voltage and having no coloring</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">When the thicknesses are set to achieve a condition of D-blue=D-green&#x3e;D-red as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the V-T characteristics of blue and green pixels are identical to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>, but the V-T characteristic of the red pixel becomes closer to the V-T characteristic of the green pixel. With this configuration, a high transmittance can be obtained in the red pixel at a lower voltage V compared to the V-T characteristic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>, and thus, the problem of coloring can be improved accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the reflective region, gap adjusting layers (projections) <b>340</b><i>r</i>, <b>340</b><i>g</i>, and <b>340</b><i>b </i>are provided for the pixels for red, green, and blue, but the color filter layers <b>332</b><i>b</i>, <b>332</b><i>g</i>, and <b>332</b><i>r </i>for blue, green, and red are present both in the transmissive region and the reflective region. Therefore, by setting the thicknesses of the color filter layers <b>332</b><i>b</i>, <b>332</b><i>g</i>, and <b>332</b><i>r </i>as described above, the relationship in the sizes of the gaps in the reflective regions becomes similar to that in the transmissive region. In other words, when the gap of blue pixel in the reflective region is G-blue (R), the gap of green pixel in the reflective region is G-green(R), the gap of red pixel in the reflective region is G-red (R), and the heights of the projections <b>340</b><i>b</i>, <b>340</b><i>g</i>, and <b>340</b><i>r </i>are identical to each other, a relationship of G-red (R)&#x3e;G-green (R)&#x2267;G-blue (R) is satisfied. Therefore, in the second preferred embodiment, the V-R characteristic (characteristic of applied voltage to the liquid crystal versus reflectance) of pixels for red, green, and blue becomes more uniform, and therefore, similar to the above, a display driven by a low voltage and having no coloring can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">A method of forming the color filters <b>332</b><i>r</i>, <b>332</b><i>g</i>, and <b>332</b><i>b </i>for red, green, and blue will now be described. Each color filter layer can be formed basically by spin coating a photosensitive resin including a pigment of the color on the second glass substrate <b>300</b> and applying exposure and development processes to pattern so that the resin remains in a predetermined region. However, in the second preferred embodiment, because the thicknesses of the color filter layers are not identical, when a thick color filter layer, for example, the blue color filter layer <b>332</b><i>b </i>is formed first, projections and depressions on the surface of the second glass substrate <b>300</b> becomes large, making it difficult to form the other color filter layers, for example, the red color filter layer <b>332</b><i>r. </i></p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In consideration of this, it is preferable that the red color filter layer <b>332</b><i>r </i>which is thin is formed first, the green color filter layer <b>332</b><i>g </i>is formed next, and the blue color filter layer <b>332</b><i>b </i>is formed last, in order to facilitate manufacturing steps. When the thickness of the blue color filter <b>332</b><i>b </i>and the green color filter layer <b>332</b><i>g </i>are identical, the two color filter layers having the same thickness can be formed in any order.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Third Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">A third preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described referring to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a diagram schematically showing a cross sectional structure of a vertical alignment liquid crystal display device according to the third preferred embodiment of the present invention. The components identical to those in the second preferred embodiment are assigned the same reference numerals and will not described again.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In the third preferred embodiment, in order to achieve different optimum thicknesses of gap G in the red, green, and blue pixels, in addition to the red, green, and blue color filter layers <b>330</b><i>r</i>, <b>330</b><i>g</i>, and <b>330</b><i>b </i>formed on the side of the second glass substrate <b>300</b> and the projections <b>340</b> (<b>340</b><i>r</i>, <b>340</b><i>g</i>, and <b>340</b><i>b</i>) for adjusting the gap difference between the transmissive region and the reflective region, an adjusting layer (gap layer) <b>350</b> for adjusting the gap difference for red, green, and blue is provided. More specifically, in the blue and green pixel regions which require smaller cell gaps G than the cell gap G in the red pixel region, photosensitive resin layers <b>350</b><i>b </i>and <b>350</b><i>g </i>are selectively formed on the blue color filter layer <b>330</b><i>b </i>and the green color filter layer <b>330</b><i>g</i>, respectively, as the adjusting layer <b>350</b>. In this description, the thickness of the photosensitive resin layer <b>350</b><i>b </i>on the blue color filter layer <b>330</b><i>b </i>is assumed to be t<b>1</b> and the thickness of the photosensitive resin layer <b>350</b><i>g </i>on the green color filter layer <b>330</b><i>g </i>is assumed to be t<b>2</b>. The values of t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b> are set so that t<b>1</b>&#x2267;t<b>2</b>. When a gap (thickness of the liquid crystal sandwiched between substrates) in the transmissive region of the blue pixel is G-blue (T), the gap in the transmissive region of the green pixel is G-green(T), and the gap in the transmissive region of the red pixel is G-red(T), these gaps satisfy a condition of G-red(T)&#x3e;G-green(T)&#x2267;G-blue (T).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the third preferred embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, when the thicknesses of the color filter layers <b>330</b><i>r</i>, <b>330</b><i>g</i>, and <b>330</b><i>b </i>are set to an identical thickness and the thicknesses of the projections <b>340</b><i>r</i>, <b>340</b><i>g</i>, and <b>340</b><i>b </i>are also set to an identical thickness, if t<b>1</b>=t<b>2</b>, the cell gaps satisfy a condition of G-green=G-blue.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In this manner, by selectively forming the photosensitive resin layer <b>350</b> at a necessary color region to achieve different optimum gaps (also referred to as &#x201c;cell gap&#x201d;) in the pixels for red, green, and blue, it is possible to achieve a more uniform V-T characteristic for pixels for red, green, and blue.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Next, a V-T characteristic of red, green, and blue pixels will be described referring to an experimental result of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A-19C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A-19C</figref>, the horizontal axis represents voltage to be applied to the liquid crystal <b>400</b> and the vertical axis represents transmittance of incident light.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">First, when G-red (T)=G-green (T)=G-blue (T) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref> (when the photosensitive resin layers <b>350</b><i>g </i>and <b>350</b><i>b </i>are not provided), the V-T characteristic significantly differs among red, green, and blue. When, on the other hand, a condition of G-red (T)&#x3e;G-green(T)&#x3e;G-blue (T) is satisfied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, the V-T characteristics of blue and red pixels become closer to the V-T characteristic of the green pixel (the characteristics for red, green, and blue without the correction are described in parentheses in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>). More specifically, when the gaps for red, green, and blue are set to G-red=4.8 &#x3bc;m, G-green=4.0 &#x3bc;m, and G-blue=3.3 &#x3bc;m, the V-T characteristics of red, green, and blue can be set almost identical to each other. With this configuration, by selecting a suitable white voltage Vwhite (for example, a voltage V in which the transmittance is maximized), it is possible to obtain display driven by a low voltage and having no coloring.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">When G-red (T)&#x3e;G-green (T)=G-blue (T) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, the V-T characteristics of blue and green pixels are identical to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, but the V-T characteristic of the red pixel becomes closer to the V-T characteristic of the green pixel. With this structure, compared to the V-T characteristic of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, it is possible to obtain a high transmittance at a lower voltage V for the red pixel, and thus, to improve the problem of coloring.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the reflective region, projections <b>340</b> are formed for each of the red, green, and blue pixels. However, because the thicknesses of the projections <b>340</b> are set to an identical value for red, green, and blue, the relationship among the gaps in the reflective region is similar to that in the transmissive region. That is, when the gap in the reflective region of the blue pixel is G-blue (R), the gap in the reflective region of the green pixel is G-green(R), and the gap in the reflective region of the red pixel is G-red(R), the gaps satisfy a condition of G-red(R)&#x3e;G-green(R)&#x2267;G-blue (R). Therefore, with the third preferred embodiment also, the V-R characteristic (characteristic of applied voltage to the liquid crystal versus reflectance) in red, green, and blue pixels can be more uniform, and, thus, it is possible to obtain a display driven by a low voltage and having no coloring.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to immersion lithography. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system, method, and computer product to measure an immersion fluid temperature and compensate for changes in the immersion fluid temperature.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A lithographic apparatus is a machine that applies a desired pattern onto a substrate. The lithographic apparatus is used in manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs). A patterning device, which is alternatively referred to as a mask or a reticle, contains a circuit pattern to be formed on an individual layer of the IC. The circuit pattern is transferred onto a target portion of a silicon wafer substrate by illuminating the patterning device with radiation. The lithographic apparatus transfers the circuit pattern by exposing the image onto a layer of radiation-sensitive material (resist) on the wafer. It is also possible to transfer the pattern from the patterning device to the substrate by imprinting the pattern onto the substrate. In general, a single substrate contains an array of adjacent target portions that are successively patterned.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has been proposed to immerse the substrate in an immersion fluid having a high refractive index relative to that of air, to fill a space between a final element of the projection system and the substrate. The point of this is to allow imaging of smaller features since the exposure radiation will have a shorter wavelength in the fluid. The effect of the immersion fluid may also be regarded as increasing both an effective numerical aperture (NA) of the system and depth of focus.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A drawback of immersing the substrate in the immersion fluid during imaging is that the exposure radiation heats the immersion fluid. The heating effect on the immersion fluid is dependent upon the delivered radiation dose. As soon as the exposure energy is turned off, the heated immersion fluid is swept away by a continuous fluid flow. Thus, the combination of changes in radiation dose and continuous fluid flow causes changes in immersion fluid temperature. As immersion fluid temperature changes, the immersion fluid expands, resulting in a change in density of the immersion fluid. As the density of the immersion fluid changes, the index of refraction of the immersion fluid also changes, causing aberrations in the image field, such as defocus. When the immersion fluid is water, the refractive index of the immersion fluid changes greatly for a comparatively small change in immersion fluid temperature. Traditional aberration control systems do not respond quickly enough to compensate for aberrations caused by changes in immersion fluid temperature due to radiation dose and continuous immersion fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An additional or alternative problem with conventional aberration control systems is inaccuracy of immersion fluid temperature measurement. Traditional immersion fluid temperature control systems measure immersion fluid temperature with a thermistor. A thermistor provides a temperature signal as feedback to an aberration control system that controls a heater element. The heater element adjusts the immersion fluid temperature. Unfortunately, the thermistor only has an accuracy of &#xb1;5 mK. Thus, an inaccurate temperature measurement may lead to a slow response time of the aberration control system, which may cause inadequate compensation for changes in immersion fluid temperature. The inadequate temperature compensation results in an unnecessary constraint on minimum feature size.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A system, method, and computer product are provided that more effectively control immersion fluid temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, there is provided a lithographic apparatus comprising an immersion fluid system and an interferometric temperature detection system. The immersion fluid system is configured to provide immersion fluid to an exposure system. The interferometric temperature detection system is configured to measure a temperature of the immersion fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further embodiments, features, and advantages, as well as the structure and operation of the various embodiments, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

In the drawings, like reference numbers may indicate identical or functionally similar elements. Additionally, the left-most digit(s) of a reference number may identify the drawing in which the reference number first appears.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">This specification discloses one or more embodiments that incorporate the features of this invention. The disclosed embodiment(s) merely exemplify the invention. The scope of the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment(s). The invention is defined by the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The embodiment(s) described, and references in the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an example embodiment,&#x201d; etc., indicate that the embodiment(s) described can include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment cannot necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is understood that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments of the invention can be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination thereof. Embodiments of the invention can also be implemented as instructions stored on a machine-readable medium, which can be read and executed by one or more processors. A machine-readable medium can include any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computing device). For example, a machine-readable medium can include read only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; flash memory devices; electrical, optical, acoustical or other forms of propagated signals (e.g., carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.), and others. Further, firmware, software, routines, instructions can be described herein as performing certain actions. However, it should be appreciated that such descriptions are merely for convenience and that such actions in fact result from computing devices, processors, controllers, or other devices executing the firmware, software, routines, instructions, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Although specific reference may be made to use of a lithographic apparatus in manufacturing a specific device (e.g., an integrated circuit or a flat panel display), it should be understood that the lithographic apparatus described herein may have other applications. Applications include, but are not limited to, manufacturing a semiconductor device, an integrated circuit, an integrated optical system, a guidance and detection pattern for a magnetic domain memory, a flat-panel display, a liquid-crystal display (LCDs), a thin-film magnetic head, a micro-electromechanical device (MEMS), etc. Also, for example in a flat panel display, the lithographic apparatus may be used to assist in creating of a variety of layers (e.g. a thin film transistor layer and/or a color filter layer). A skilled artisan will appreciate that, in the context of such alternative applications, any use of the terms &#x201c;wafer&#x201d; or &#x201c;die&#x201d; herein may be considered as synonymous with the more general terms &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; or &#x201c;target portion&#x201d;, respectively. Further, the substrate may be processed more than once, for example in order to create a multi-layer IC, so that the term substrate used herein may also refer to a substrate that already contains multiple processed layers.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An embodiment may be applied to any immersion lithography apparatus, such as, but not exclusively, those types mentioned herein. An immersion fluid may be provided in the form of a bath or only on a localized surface of the substrate. An immersion fluid system as contemplated herein should be broadly construed. In an embodiment, the immersion fluid supply system may be a mechanism or combination of structures that provides a fluid to a cavity defined by a projection system and a substrate and/or a substrate table. The immersion fluid supply system may comprise a combination of one or more structures, one or more fluid inlets, one or more gas inlets, one or more gas outlets, and/or one or more fluid outlets that provide the fluid to the space. In an embodiment, a surface of the cavity may be a portion of the substrate and/or the substrate table. In a further embodiment, a surface of the cavity may completely cover a surface of the substrate and/or the substrate table. In another embodiment, a surface of the cavity may space may envelop the substrate and/or substrate table. The immersion fluid supply system may optionally include an apparatus to control features of the fluid including, and not limited to, a position, quantity, quality, shape, flow rate, temperature and/or other fluid characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The immersion fluid used in the immersion fluid system may have different compositions, according to properties and a wavelength of exposure radiation used. As an example, for an exposure wavelength of 193 nm, ultra pure water or a water-based composition may be used as the immersion fluid. For this reason, the immersion fluid is sometimes referred to as water. Water-related terms such as hydrophilic, hydrophobic, humidity, etc. may be used when describing the immersion fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> depict an exemplary lithography apparatus <b>100</b>, also known as an immersion lithography exposure system. The lithography apparatus <b>100</b> includes an immersion fluid system. The immersion fluid system is configured to provide immersion fluid to the immersion lithography exposure system. Further, the immersion fluid system is also configured to remove immersion fluid from the immersion lithography exposure system. The lithography apparatus <b>100</b> also includes an interferometric temperature detection system (e.g., see system <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) that is configured to measure a temperature of the immersion fluid. The lithography apparatus <b>100</b> is now described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the lithography apparatus <b>100</b> comprises an illumination system (e.g., an illuminator) IL configured to condition a radiation beam PB (e.g. UV radiation or DUV radiation). There is also a support structure (e.g., a mask table) MT constructed to support a patterning device (e.g., a mask or array of individually controllable elements) MA. The support structure (e.g., a mask table) MT is connected to a first positioner PM configured to accurately position the patterning device. A substrate table (e.g., a wafer or substrate table) WT is configured to hold a substrate (e.g. a resist-coated wafer or flat panel display substrate) W and is connected to a second positioner PW configured to accurately position the substrate. A projection system (e.g., a refractive projection lens system) PL is configured to project a pattern imparted to the radiation beam PB by a patterning device MA onto a target portion C (e.g., comprising one or more dies) of the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The lithography apparatus <b>100</b> may include various types of optical components, such as refractive, reflective, magnetic, electromagnetic, electrostatic or other types of optical components, or any combination thereof, for directing, shaping, or controlling the radiation beam PB.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The support structure MT holds the patterning device MA in a manner that depends on an orientation of the patterning device MA, the design of the lithography apparatus <b>100</b>, and other conditions, such as for example whether or not the patterning device MA is held in a vacuum environment. The support structure MT may use mechanical, vacuum, electrostatic or other clamping techniques to hold the patterning device MA. The support structure MT may be a frame or a table, for example, which may be fixed or movable. The support structure MT may ensure that the patterning device MA is at a specific position, for example a position respective to the projection system PL.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;patterning device&#x201d; as used herein should be broadly interpreted as referring to any device that may be used to impart a radiation beam PB with a pattern in its cross-section, such as to create a pattern in a target portion C of the substrate W. It should be noted that the pattern imparted to the radiation beam PB may not exactly correspond to the desired pattern in the target portion C of the substrate W, for example if the pattern includes phase-shifting features or assist features. Generally, the pattern created on the target portion C of the substrate W will correspond to a particular functional layer in a device being created in the target portion C, such as an integrated circuit or a flat panel display (e.g., a color filter layer in a flat panel display or a thin film transistor layer in a flat panel display).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The patterning device MA may be transmissive or reflective. Examples of such patterning devices include reticles, programmable mirror arrays, laser diode arrays, light emitting diode arrays, grating light valves, and LCD arrays. Masks are well known in lithography, and include mask types such as binary, alternating phase-shift, and attenuated phase-shift, as well as various hybrid mask types. An example of a programmable mirror array employs a matrix arrangement of small mirrors, each of which may be individually tilted, so as to reflect a part of an incoming radiation beam in different directions. The tilted mirrors impart a pattern in a radiation beam, which is reflected by the mirror matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The lithography apparatus <b>100</b> may be of a type having two (dual stage) or more of the substrate tables WT and/or two or more of the support structures MT. In such &#x201c;multiple stage&#x201d; machines, the additional tables WT or the support structures MT may be used in parallel, or preparatory steps may be carried out on one or more tables WT or the support structures MT while one or more other tables WT or support structures MT are being used for exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the illuminator IL receives the radiation beam PB from the radiation source SO. The source SO and the lithography apparatus <b>100</b> may be separate apparatus, for example when the source SO is an excimer laser. In such cases, the source SO is not considered to form part of the lithography apparatus <b>100</b> and the radiation beam is passed from the source SO to the illuminator IL with the aid of a beam delivery system BD comprising, for example, suitable directing mirrors and/or a beam expander. In other cases, the source SO may be an integral part of the lithography apparatus <b>100</b>, for example when the source SO is a mercury lamp. The source SO and the illuminator IL, together with the beam delivery system BD if required, may be referred to as a radiation system.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The illuminator IL may comprise an adjuster AM for adjusting an angular intensity distribution of the radiation beam PB. Generally, at least the outer and/or inner radial extent (commonly referred to as &#x3c3;-outer and &#x3c3;-inner, respectively) of the intensity distribution in a pupil plane of the illuminator IL may be adjusted. In addition, the illuminator IL may comprise various other components, such as an integrator IN and a condenser CO. The illuminator IL may be used to condition a cross-section of the radiation beam PB to a uniform intensity distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The radiation beam PB is incident on the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA, which is held on the support structure (e.g., mask table) MT, and is patterned by the patterning device MA. Having traversed the patterning device MA, the radiation beam PB passes through the projection system PL, which focuses the beam onto a target portion C of the substrate W. An immersion hood IH, which is described further herein, supplies an immersion fluid <b>160</b> from the immersion fluid system to a cavity defined by the final element of the projection system PL and the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With aid of a second positioner PW and a position sensor IF (e.g., an interferometric device, linear encoder or capacitive sensor), the substrate table WT may be moved accurately (e.g., to position different target portions C in a path of the radiation beam PB). Similarly, a first positioner PM and another position sensor (which is not explicitly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) may be used to accurately position the patterning device MA with respect to the path of the radiation beam PB (e.g., after mechanical retrieval from a mask library, and/or during a scan). In general, movement of the support structure MT may be realized with aid of a long-stroke module (coarse positioning) and a short-stroke module (fine positioning), which form part of the first positioner PM. Similarly, movement of the substrate table WT may be realized using a long-stroke module and a short-stroke module, which form part of the second positioner PW. In the case of a stepper (as opposed to a scanner), the support structure MT may be connected to a short-stroke actuator only, or may be fixed. The patterning device MA and the substrate W may be aligned using patterning device alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>. Although the substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> as illustrated occupy dedicated target portions, the substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> may be located in spaces between target portions (these also are known as scribe-lane alignment marks). Similarly, in situations in which more than one die is provided on the patterning device MA, the patterning device alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> may be located between the target portions C (e.g., dies).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Patterning devices MA whose pattern is programmable with the aid of electronic means (e.g., a computer), such as patterning devices comprising a plurality of programmable elements (e.g., all the devices mentioned in the previous sentence except for the reticle), are collectively referred to herein as &#x201c;contrast devices.&#x201d; The patterning device MA comprises at least 10, at least 100, at least 1,000, at least 10,000, at least 100,000, at least 1,000,000, or at least 10,000,000 programmable elements.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A programmable mirror array can comprise a matrix-addressable surface having a viscoelastic control layer and a reflective surface. The basic principle behind such an apparatus is that addressed areas of the reflective surface reflect incident light as diffracted light, whereas unaddressed areas reflect incident light as undiffracted light. Using an appropriate spatial filter, the undiffracted light can be filtered out of the reflected beam, leaving only the diffracted light to reach the substrate W. In this manner, the beam PB becomes patterned according to the addressing pattern of the matrix-addressable surface.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It will be appreciated that, as an alternative, the filter can filter out the diffracted light, leaving the undiffracted light to reach the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An array of diffractive optical MEMS devices (micro-electro-mechanical system devices) can also be used in a corresponding manner. In one example, a diffractive optical MEMS device is composed of a plurality of reflective ribbons that can be deformed relative to one another to form a grating that reflects incident light as diffracted light.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A further alternative example of a programmable mirror array employs a matrix arrangement of tiny mirrors, each of which can be individually tilted about an axis by applying a suitable localized electric field, or by employing piezoelectric actuation means. Once again, the mirrors are matrix-addressable, such that addressed mirrors reflect an incoming radiation beam PB in a different direction than unaddressed mirrors; in this manner, the reflected beam can be patterned according to the addressing pattern of the matrix-addressable mirrors. The required matrix addressing can be performed using suitable electronic means.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Another example patterning device is a programmable LCD array.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> may comprise one or more contrast devices. For example, it can have a plurality of arrays of individually controllable elements, each controlled independently of each other. In such an arrangement, some or all of the arrays of individually controllable elements can have at least one of a common illumination system (or part of an illumination system), a common support structure for the arrays of individually controllable elements, and/or a common projection system (or part of the projection system).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one example, such as the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the substrate W has a substantially circular shape, optionally with a notch and/or a flattened edge along part of its perimeter. In another example, the substrate W has a polygonal shape, e.g., a rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Examples where the substrate W has a substantially circular shape include examples where the substrate has a diameter of at least 25 mm, at least 50 mm, at least 75 mm, at least 100 mm, at least 125 mm, at least 150 mm, at least 175 mm, at least 200 mm, at least 250 mm, or at least 300 mm. Alternatively, the substrate has a diameter of at most 500 mm, at most 400 mm, at most 350 mm, at most 300 mm, at most 250 mm, at most 200 mm, at most 150 mm, at most 100 mm, or at most 75 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Examples where the substrate is polygonal, e.g., rectangular, include examples where at least one side, at least 2 sides or at least 3 sides, of the substrate has a length of at least 5 cm, at least 25 cm, at least 50 cm, at least 100 cm, at least 150 cm, at least 200 cm, or at least 250 cm. At least one side of the substrate W has a length of at most 1000 cm, at most 750 cm, at most 500 cm, at most 350 cm, at most 250 cm, at most 150 cm, or at most 75 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one example, the substrate W is a wafer, for instance a semiconductor wafer. The wafer material can be selected from the group consisting of Si, SiGe, SiGeC, SiC, Ge, GaAs, InP, and InAs. The wafer can be: a III/V compound semiconductor wafer, a silicon wafer, a ceramic substrate, a glass substrate, or a plastic substrate. The substrate W can be transparent (for the naked human eye), colored, or absent a color.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The thickness of the substrate W can vary and, to an extent, can depend on the substrate material and/or the substrate dimensions. The thickness can be at least 50 &#x3bc;m, at least 100 &#x3bc;m, at least 200 &#x3bc;m, at least 300 &#x3bc;m, at least 400 &#x3bc;m, at least 500 &#x3bc;m, or at least 600 &#x3bc;m. Alternatively, the thickness of the substrate W can be at most 5000 &#x3bc;m, at most 3500 &#x3bc;m, at most 2500 &#x3bc;m, at most 1750 &#x3bc;m, at most 1250 &#x3bc;m, at most 1000 &#x3bc;m, at most 800 &#x3bc;m, at most 600 &#x3bc;m, at most 500 &#x3bc;m, at most 400 &#x3bc;m, or at most 300 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The substrate W referred to herein can be processed, before or after exposure, in for example a track (a tool that typically applies a layer of resist to a substrate W and develops the exposed resist), a metrology tool, and/or an inspection tool. In one example, a resist layer is provided on the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The projection system PL can image the pattern on the array of individually controllable elements, such that the pattern is coherently formed on the substrate W. Alternatively, the projection system PL can image secondary sources for which the elements of the array of individually controllable elements act as shutters. In this respect, the projection system PL can comprise an array of focusing elements such as a micro lens array (known as an MLA) or a Fresnel lens array to form the secondary sources and to image spots onto the substrate W. The array of focusing elements (e.g., MLA) comprises at least 10 focus elements, at least 100 focus elements, at least 1,000 focus elements, at least 10,000 focus elements, at least 100,000 focus elements, or at least 1,000,000 focus elements.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The number of individually controllable elements in the patterning device MA is equal to or greater than the number of focusing elements in the array of focusing elements. One or more (e.g., 1,000 or more, the majority, or each) of the focusing elements in the array of focusing elements can be optically associated with one or more of the individually controllable elements in the array of individually controllable elements, with 2 or more, 3 or more, 5 or more, 10 or more, 20 or more, 25 or more, 35 or more, or 50 or more of the individually controllable elements in the array of individually controllable elements.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The MLA can be movable (e.g., with the use of one or more actuators) at least in the direction to and away from the substrate W. Being able to move the MLA to and away from the substrate W allows, e.g., for focus adjustment without having to move the substrate W.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the illuminator IL receives the radiation beam PB from a radiation source SO. The radiation source SO provides radiation having a wavelength of at least 5 nm, at least 10 nm, at least 11-13 nm, at least 50 nm, at least 100 nm, at least 150 nm, at least 175 nm, at least 200 nm, at least 250 nm, at least 275 nm, at least 300 nm, at least 325 nm, at least 350 nm, or at least 360 nm. Alternatively, the radiation provided by radiation source SO has a wavelength of at most 450 nm, at most 425 nm, at most 375 nm, at most 360 nm, at most 325 nm, at most 275 nm, at most 250 nm, at most 225 nm, at most 200 nm, or at most 175 nm. The radiation can have a wavelength including 436 nm , 405 nm, 365 nm, 355 nm, 248 nm, 193 nm, 157 nm, and/or 126 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The lithography apparatus <b>100</b> may be used in at least one of the following modes:</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">1. In step mode, the support structure MT and the substrate table WT are kept essentially stationary, while an entire pattern imparted to the radiation beam PB is projected onto a target portion C at one time (i.e. a single static exposure). The substrate table WT is then shifted in the X and/or Y direction so that a different target portion C may be exposed. In the step mode, a maximum size of an exposure field limits a size of the target portion C imaged in a single static exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">2. In scan mode, the support structure MT and the substrate table WT are scanned synchronously while a pattern C imparted to the radiation beam PB is projected onto a target portion C (i.e. a single dynamic exposure). The velocity and direction of the substrate table WT relative to the support structure MT may be determined by (de-)magnification and image reversal characteristics of the projection system PL. In the scan mode, a maximum size of an exposure field limits a width (in the non-scanning direction) of a target portion C in a single dynamic exposure, whereas a length of the scanning motion determines a height (in the scanning direction) of the target portion C.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">3. In another mode, the support structure MT is kept essentially stationary while holding a programmable patterning device, and the substrate table WT is moved or scanned while a pattern imparted to the radiation beam PB is projected onto the target portion C. In this mode, the source SO is a pulsed radiation source and the programmable patterning device is updated as required after each movement of the substrate table WT or in between successive radiation pulses during a scan. This mode of operation may be readily applied to maskless lithography that utilizes programmable patterning device, such as a programmable mirror array of a type as referred to herein. Combinations and/or variations on the modes of use described herein or entirely different modes of use may also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the lithography apparatus <b>100</b> with a localized fluid supply system <b>150</b> that supplies the immersion fluid <b>160</b> via an inlet IN. The inlet IN may be a final lens element showerhead and may be located on a side of the projection system PL. The immersion fluid <b>160</b> is removed by an outlet OUT. The lithography apparatus <b>100</b> includes an interferometric temperature sensor <b>180</b> that is configured to measure a temperature of the immersion fluid <b>160</b>. In an example, the interferometric temperature sensor <b>180</b> is located as close as possible to the inlet IN. In a further example, the interferometric temperature sensor <b>180</b> is located to measure a temperature of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> in a cavity defined by the final element of the projection system PL and the substrate table WT. The interferometric temperature sensor <b>180</b> may provide area temperature mapping, as opposed to single point temperature measurement, such as that provided by a thermistor. Temperature mapping provides data that may be used to confirm temperature simulation results as well as for optimizing showerhead design and/or lens design.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a further example, the lithography apparatus <b>100</b> also includes a second interferometric temperature sensor <b>190</b> that is configured to measure a temperature of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> output from the outlet OUT. The second interferometric temperature sensor <b>190</b> measures a temperature of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> that may be used to determine a heat load imposed on the immersion fluid <b>160</b> by the beam PB. A determination of the heat load may be used as a control signal to actuate an apparatus that controls a flow rate and/or heat polishing of the immersion fluid <b>160</b>. In another example, an interferometer, such as those described herein, may be configured to measure the temperature of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> at any point where the immersion fluid <b>160</b> is present.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The localized fluid supply system <b>150</b> may contain a heat exchanger <b>170</b> in contact with the immersion fluid <b>160</b>. The heat exchanger <b>170</b> is any apparatus capable of energy transfer to and/or from the immersion fluid <b>160</b>. The heat exchanger <b>170</b> may add energy to the immersion fluid <b>160</b>, thus increasing the temperature of the immersion fluid <b>160</b>. Further or alternatively, the heat exchanger <b>170</b> may remove energy from the immersion fluid <b>160</b>, thus decreasing the temperature of the immersion fluid <b>160</b>. A quantity of energy transferred by the heat exchanger <b>170</b> is controllable. The quantity of energy transferred by the heat exchanger <b>170</b> may be controlled by a control circuit, such as a controller (e.g., see controller <b>420</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). In an example, the heat exchanger <b>170</b> is a peltier device, also known as a thermoelectric module. The heat exchanger <b>170</b> may be of a liquid-to-liquid or a liquid-to-gas design. In an example, the heat exchanger <b>170</b> is located as close as possible to the inlet IN to minimize energy transfer between the immersion fluid <b>160</b> and the environment around the localized fluid supply system <b>150</b>. In another example, the heat exchanger <b>170</b> may be configured to change the temperature of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> at any point where the immersion fluid <b>160</b> is present.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As part of a method to control a temperature of the immersion fluid <b>160</b>, energy may be transferred to and/or from the immersion fluid <b>160</b> at any time. For example, the immersion fluid <b>160</b> may be cooled prior to entering the inlet IN. The heat exchanger <b>170</b> is integrated into the inlet IN and provides energy to the immersion fluid <b>160</b> to heat the immersion fluid <b>160</b>. The energy provided by the integrated heat exchanger <b>170</b> is reduced during an exposure to control the temperature of the immersion fluid <b>160</b>. Immersion fluid temperature control offsets an increased thermal load applied to the immersion fluid <b>160</b> by the radiation beam PB. Thus, in one example a location for control of the immersion fluid temperature is in the cavity defined by the final element of the projection system PL and the substrate table WT.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an example, the substrate W is immersed in the immersion fluid <b>160</b> within the cavity defined by the final element of the projection system PL and the substrate table WT. In this example, the immersion fluid <b>160</b> is one having a relatively high refractive index, e.g., the immersion fluid may be water, that fills a space between the final element of the projection system PL and the substrate W. This allows for imaging of smaller features when the beam PB has a shorter wavelength in the immersion fluid <b>160</b>. The effect of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> may also be regarded as allowing the numerical aperture (NA) of the system to be higher than 1, and increasing a depth of focus (DOF). Other immersion fluids have been proposed for use as the immersion fluid <b>160</b>, including water with solid particles (e.g., quartz) suspended therein.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref> are diagrams showing an exemplary flow of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> and an exemplary temperature effect resulting from exposure energy from the source SO. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> includes a zoomed-in view of a region around an optical element <b>210</b> that is the final element of the projection system PL. The immersion lithography showerhead inlet IN drives the immersion fluid <b>160</b> into an exposure zone <b>220</b>. The exposure zone <b>220</b> is an area of the substrate W that is patterned, and thus subject to exposure energy from the radiation beam PB. The immersion lithography showerhead outlet OUT removes the immersion fluid <b>160</b> from the exposure zone <b>220</b>. In the lithography apparatus <b>100</b>, the immersion lithography showerhead inlet IN and outlet OUT may be housed in an immersion lithography showerhead. The flow rate of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> may be controlled as a function of immersion fluid characteristic(s), for example to ensure that a minimum amount of turbulence is introduced in the immersion fluid <b>160</b> to avoid an optical impairment as the immersion fluid <b>160</b> flows through the exposure zone <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B-C</figref> illustrate first and second plots <b>230</b> and <b>240</b>, which show a steady state exposure temperature distribution of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> within the exposure zone <b>220</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the first plot <b>230</b> shows the temperature distribution when radiation from the beam PB projects through the immersion fluid <b>160</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the second plot <b>240</b> shows the temperature distribution when the source SO is off and no radiation from the beam PB projects through the immersion fluid <b>160</b>. As can be seen when comparing these plots, a heating effect on the immersion fluid <b>160</b> is substantially instantaneous and dependent upon the delivered dose of radiation from the beam PB. As soon as the exposure energy is removed, the heated mass of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> is swept away by fluid flow. Thus, the flowing immersion fluid <b>160</b> induces a non-symmetric temperature distribution across the width of the exposure zone <b>220</b>. The non-symmetric temperature distribution may induce aberrations in the image field. The aberrations, such as defocus, may change across the width of the image field.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The steady state exposure temperature distribution changes linearly across the width of the exposure zone <b>220</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. A magnitude of a temperature of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> changes (during exposure) from a nominal value at the upstream edge of the exposure zone <b>220</b>. The magnitude of the immersion fluid temperature increases approximately linearly from the upstream edge of the exposure zone <b>220</b> to a downstream edge of the exposure zone <b>220</b>. The temperature increase results from the immersion fluid <b>160</b> gaining energy from the radiation beam PB as it flows across the exposure zone <b>220</b>. The magnitude of the temperature change on the downstream edge of the exposure zone <b>220</b> depends on, for example, the exposure dose, mask transparency, the fluid flow rate, and the absorption of exposure radiation by the immersion fluid <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">An exemplary calculation of the heating effect is presented below. As an example, the source SO of the lithography apparatus <b>100</b> may produce ultra-violet radiation. In this case, power absorbed in the immersion fluid <b>160</b> may be determined through the following equation:

where C<sub>p </sub>is the specific heat of the immersion fluid <b>160</b>.

When the source SO has a wavelength of 193 nm, the OPD equates to a fraction 0.007 of a wavelength. This represents an estimate of the magnitude of the exposure dose and pattern density sensitive wavefront aberration due to the asymmetric heating of the immersion fluid <b>160</b> that assumes a 100% transparent reticle, which is to be compensated for in the optics wavefront.

The radiation source <b>305</b> produces the beam of radiation <b>310</b> that is coherent, and to which the immersion fluid <b>160</b> is transparent. In an example, the radiation source <b>305</b> produces a beam of radiation <b>310</b> that has a non-actinic wavelength to prevent activation of a resist layer on the substrate W.

A typical reflection of the second polarization state is by an angle of ninety degrees.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-6</figref>, the present invention features an improved smoke detector device <b>100</b>. The smoke detector device <b>100</b> comprises a plurality of interconnecting modules (forming a ring-like structure around a central base) for storing various items, increasing the versatility of the smoke detector device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the smoke detector device <b>100</b> comprises a base <b>110</b> for mounting on a wall or ceiling. The smoke detector device <b>100</b> may be mounted to a place on the wall or ceiling that is aligned with a beam or joist. In some embodiments, the smoke detector device <b>100</b> is mounted to (and in some cases connected to) an existing electrical fixture/box (e.g., a light fixture). For example, the wire components of the existing electrical fixture may be used by the smoke detector device <b>100</b> or by both the existing electrical fixture and the smoke detector device <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the smoke detector device <b>100</b> does not utilize the wire components of the existing electrical fixture/box. For example, the smoke detector device <b>100</b> is operatively connected to a battery power source, eliminating the need to be operatively connected to wire components of an existing electrical fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The base <b>110</b> has an inner cavity, a top end <b>111</b>, and a bottom end <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the base <b>110</b> is generally cylindrical in shape. Disposed in the top end <b>111</b> of the base <b>110</b> is a top aperture <b>115</b>. In some embodiments, electrical wires, for example wires from the existing electrical fixture, may be inserted into the inner cavity of the base <b>110</b> via the top aperture <b>115</b>. In some embodiments, a groove <b>120</b> is disposed in the base <b>110</b>, for example near the top end <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Disposed in the base <b>110</b> (e.g., in the inner cavity of the base <b>110</b>) at the top end <b>111</b> of the base <b>110</b> is one or more mounting holes <b>130</b> adapted to receive screws, bolts, nails, and the like. The mounting holes <b>130</b> allow the base <b>110</b> to be attached to the wall, ceiling, or electrical box. The base <b>110</b> is attached to the wall or ceiling such that the top end <b>111</b> of the base <b>110</b> is generally flush with the wall or ceiling. The screws, bolts, and/or nails can be driven through the mounting holes <b>130</b>, through the ceiling or wall, and further into the beam or joist in the ceiling or wall. In some embodiments, the mounting holes <b>130</b> are positioned at edges of the top aperture <b>115</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the bottom end <b>112</b> or a portion of the base <b>110</b> at the bottom end <b>112</b> functions as a removable cover, for example the bottom end <b>112</b> (or a portion of the base <b>110</b> at the bottom end <b>112</b>) can be removed from the base <b>110</b> for allowing access to the inner cavity of the base <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the bottom end <b>112</b> of the base <b>110</b> is removed so a user can access to the mounting holes <b>130</b> and attach the base <b>110</b> to the wall or ceiling. In some embodiments, the bottom end <b>112</b> or a portion of the base <b>110</b> at the bottom end <b>112</b> is removably attached to the base via an attachment means, for example a first hinge mechanism <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the bottom end <b>112</b> of the base <b>110</b> (or a portion of the base <b>110</b> at the bottom end <b>112</b>) can be removed and an alternative item can be attached to the base <b>110</b> in its place. For example, in some embodiments, a light or a speaker is installed in place of the bottom end <b>112</b> of the base <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, if the smoke detector device <b>100</b> is connected to an existing electrical fixture/box, the existing electrical fixture can still function as it did previously before the smoke detector device <b>100</b> was added. As an example, if the smoke detector device <b>100</b> is connected to an existing light fixture box, a light can be installed in lieu of the bottom end <b>112</b> of the base <b>110</b>, allowing the light fixture box to still function to support the light while simultaneously supporting the smoke detector device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The smoke detector device <b>100</b> further comprises a ring <b>200</b> that can be removably attached to (e.g., wrapping around) the base <b>110</b>. The ring <b>200</b> can move between an open and closed position so as to be fitted onto the base <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the ring <b>200</b> wraps around (e.g., snugly fits into) the groove <b>120</b> of the base <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the ring <b>200</b> may be generally circular in shape. The ring <b>200</b> is not limited to a standard circular ring shape. In some embodiments, the shape of the ring <b>200</b> is generally oval, rectangular or square, triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, octagonal, trapezoidal, irregular, or the like. The ring <b>200</b> is not limited to the aforementioned shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The ring <b>200</b> can pivot between an open position and a closed position, for example via a second hinge mechanism <b>225</b>. The ring <b>200</b> may be divided into a first half ring and a second half ring, each half ring having a first end and a second end. The first end of the first half ring is pivotally attached to the first end of the second half ring, for example via the second hinge mechanism <b>225</b>. The second hinge mechanism <b>225</b> may comprise hinge hook <b>227</b> disposed on the first end of the second half ring that engages (e.g., removably engages) a hinge rod <b>226</b> disposed on the first end of the first half ring. Hinge mechanisms are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second end of the first half ring may be locked to the second end of the second half ring to secure the ring <b>200</b> in the closed position. In some embodiments, a locking mechanism secures the ring <b>200</b> in the closed position. As an example, in some embodiments, a locking clip <b>212</b> is disposed on the second end of the first half ring. The locking clip <b>212</b> is for engaging a locking aperture <b>214</b> disposed in the second end of the second half ring. The locking clip <b>212</b> can snap into and out of the locking aperture <b>214</b>. In some embodiments, a release button <b>290</b> is connected to the locking mechanism for unlocking the locking mechanism. For example, the release button <b>290</b> can move between a pressed position and a released position (the release button <b>290</b> may be biased in the released position, for example caused by a spring). When the release button <b>290</b> is in the pressed position, it pushes the locking clip <b>212</b> out of the locking aperture <b>214</b>. Release buttons (e.g., spring-loaded buttons and the like) are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The ring <b>200</b> is divided into one or more modules that connect together to form the ring via a connecting means. In some embodiments, the ring <b>200</b> is divided into two modules. In some embodiments, the ring <b>200</b> is divided into three modules. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in some embodiments, the ring <b>200</b> is divided into four modules, for example a first module <b>210</b>, a second module <b>220</b>, a third module <b>230</b>, and a fourth module. The ring <b>200</b> is not limited to four modules, for example the ring <b>200</b> may comprise five, six, seven, eight, or more than eight modules. In some embodiments, the first module <b>210</b> and the second module <b>220</b> make up the first half ring. In some embodiments, the third module <b>230</b> and the fourth module <b>240</b> make up the second half ring.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the modules can be separated from each other and put back together (e.g., via a connecting means) to reform the ring <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, the second hinge mechanism <b>225</b> may be taken apart allowing the modules with the second hinge mechanism <b>225</b> to be separated. Separating the modules allows a user to modify the modules in the ring <b>200</b> as needed. For example, the user may have a ring <b>200</b> comprising two modules and wish to add more modules. He/she can replace one (or both) of the original modules with different modules. As an example, a single large module can be replaced with two smaller modules that combined fit where the original module was within the ring <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each module has a first end and a second end. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first end of the first module <b>210</b> comprises the locking clip <b>212</b> and the second end of the third module comprises the locking aperture <b>214</b> and the release button <b>290</b>. The second end of the second module <b>220</b> comprises the hinge rod <b>226</b> and the first end of the fourth module <b>240</b> comprises the hinge hook <b>227</b>. The locking mechanism and the second hinge mechanism <b>225</b> may be considered connecting means. The modules can be connected together via additional connecting means. In some embodiments, the modules can be connected together via assembly clips <b>228</b> that snugly snap onto ends of two modules. For example, the second end of the first module <b>210</b> can be secured to the first end of the second module via an assembly clip <b>228</b>. The connecting means is not limited to assembly clips, and may include other standard connecting means such as clamps, snaps, adhesives, hook-and-loop fasteners, the like, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each module has an inner chamber for holding items. Each module comprises a door <b>480</b> that can open and close respectively allowing and preventing access to the inner chamber of the module.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The modules of the smoke detector device <b>100</b> can accept other devices in addition to a smoke detecting component <b>250</b> including but not limited to a wireless network card <b>252</b>, a speaker <b>255</b> (e.g., music speakers), a camera <b>272</b> (e.g., surveillance camera), a battery <b>258</b> (e.g., a rechargeable battery), a light <b>262</b>, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the speakers can receive audio signals wirelessly from a music system (e.g., a stereo system, a MP3 player, etc.). In some embodiments, the music system comprises a corresponding wireless module attached to its audio output (for example, the AUX output on the back of the stereo). In some embodiments, the speaker <b>255</b> can also be programmed (e.g., via a microprocessor) to broadcast certain messages, for example a warning message in the case of a fire.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">If needed, items in the modules can be operatively connected to a power source. In some embodiments, the power source is a battery (e.g., rechargeable battery). In some embodiments, the power source is the electrical system of the existing electrical fixture. Wires can be directed from the wall or ceiling into the inner cavity of the base <b>110</b> (via the top aperture). In some embodiments, a base wire opening <b>145</b> is disposed in the base <b>110</b> (e.g., in the groove <b>120</b> of the base <b>110</b>). Wires can be directed out of the inner cavity of the base <b>110</b> and into a module (e.g., via a module wire opening <b>146</b> in the module). The base wire opening <b>145</b> in the base <b>110</b> may be aligned with the module wire opening <b>146</b> of the module.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the ring <b>200</b> may comprise one or more (e.g., two) steel support rods for providing additional support when mounting the smoke detector device <b>100</b> to the wall or ceiling. The steel support rods <b>660</b> may run parallel to each other, spanning the ring from a first side to a second side. The steel support rods <b>660</b> may be positioned a certain distance apart so that the steel support rods <b>660</b> snugly fit around the base <b>110</b> (e.g., the groove <b>120</b> of the base <b>110</b>). The steel support rods <b>660</b> have a first end and a second end, the first end having a first mounting hole <b>630</b> and the second end having a second mounting hole <b>630</b>. The steel support rods are long enough to be attached to two beams or joists, for example the first end is aligned (e.g., perpendicularly aligned) with a first joist and the second end is aligned (e.g., perpendicularly aligned) with a second joist.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in some embodiments, the steel support rods <b>660</b> and the base <b>110</b> combined form inner chambers that can hold various items including but not limited to a camera <b>272</b>, a wireless network card <b>258</b>, a light <b>262</b>, a battery <b>252</b>, and the smoke detector component <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the smoke alarm component comprises a rechargeable battery than can be charged whenever the electrical fixture (e.g., light switch) is turned on. (The rechargeable battery may be operatively connected to the electrical fixture/wiring). This may eliminate the need for the user to replace the battery (which may require a possibly dangerous ascent up a ladder), as in current household smoke alarm designs. In some embodiments, the smoke detector component can alert the user when the battery needs charging via an alarm (beeping) or even a user-programmed voice message.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An optical pickup is provided for directing a blue-violet laser beam to access a first information recording medium covered with a first transparent substrate or a second information recording medium covered with a second transparent substrate, which includes a light path switching unit disposed either between a light source and a coupling lens or between the coupling lens and an objective lens for switching the blue-violet laser beam between a first light path and a second light path. The coupling lens is arranged to convert the laser beam reflected on the first or second information recording medium to a converged light. The converged light of the laser beam is then received by a photo detector.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an optical pickup for performing at least the action of either optically recording or reproducing the data on different types of information recording mediums such as optical discs and the like, an optical disc apparatus equipped with the optical pickup, an optical information equipment equipped with the optical disc apparatus, and an integrated coupling lens and an integrated prism installed in the optical pickup.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As blue-violet semiconductor laser diodes have been introduced for practical use, Blu-ray Discs (referred to as BDs hereinafter) of high-density, mass-storage optical information recording mediums (referred to as optical disc hereinafter) are now put to practical use which are identical in the size to CDs (compact discs) and DVDs (digital versatile discs). The BDs are optical discs on which data are recorded or played back with the use of a blue-violet laser source which emits a blue-violet laser beam. Also, HD-DVDs are put to practical use on the basis of a blue-violet laser source. The expression &#x201c;either recording or playing back&#x201d; in this specification means that at least either the recording action or the playback action is to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The CDs are optical discs in which the thickness of their transparent substrate from the optical disc surface to the information recording surface is 1.2 mm, the wavelength of laser beam for performing either the recording or playback is substantially 780 nm, the numerical aperture NA of their objective lens ranges from 0.45 to 0.55, and their recording capacity is substantially 650 MBytes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is required for performing either the recording action or the playback action at higher densities on the optical discs to minimize the diameter of the spot of the laser beam focused by the objective lens. To minimize the diameter of the spot of the laser beam, the wavelength &#x3bb; has to be shortened while the numerical aperture NA of the objective lens is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when the numerical aperture NA of the objective lens is increased, in proportion to the cube of the NA, the comatic aberration derived from tilting of the transparent substrate becomes large. As the comatic aberration is proportional to the thickness of the transparent substrate, it can be suppressed by thinning the transparent substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The DVDs are optical discs in which the thickness of their transparent substrate is 0.6 mm, the wavelength of laser beam for performing either the recording or playback action is substantially 650 nm, the numerical aperture NA of their objective lens ranges from 0.60 to 0.65, and their recording capacity at one layer is substantially 4.7 GBytes. The DVD is made of two 0.6 mm thick discs bonded to each other and its total thickness is thus 1.2 mm as equal to that of a CD.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The BDs are optical discs in which the thickness of their transparent substrate is about 0.1 mm, the wavelength of laser beam for performing either the recording or playback action is substantially 405 nm, the numerical aperture NA of their objective lens is 0.85, and their recording capacity at one layer is substantially 25 GBytes. The BD has a recording layer provided on a disc base material of 1.1 mm thick and protected with a transparent cover layer of 0.1 mm thick (the transparent substrate) and its total thickness is thus 1.2 mm as equal to that of a CD. Either the recording action or the playback action on the recording layer is performed with a laser beam converged from the transparent cover layer to the recording layer. An increase of the comatic aberration produced by a combination of the laser beam at shorter wavelengths and the objective lens at higher NA is suppressed by thinning the transparent cover layer through which the laser beam passes to substantially 0.1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The HD-DVDs are optical discs in which the wavelength of laser beam for performing either the recording or playback action is substantially 405 nm, the numerical aperture NA of their objective lens is 0.65, and their recording capacity at one layer is substantially 15 GBytes. The HD-DVD like the DVD is made of two 0.6 mm thick discs bonded to each other and its total thickness is 1.2 mm as equal to that of a CD.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As explained, there are available such different types, CD, DVD, BD, and HD-DVD, of the optical discs. Accordingly, some optical pickups of compatible type have been proposed for performing either the recording action or the playback action with the use of three different wavelengths of the laser beams focused by a plurality of objective lenses to scan the different types of the optical discs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2006-147075, is an optical pickup arranged compatible with four different types, CD, DVD, BD, and HD-DVD, of the optical discs by switching the combination of two objective lenses and light sources.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an optical pickup <b>150</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref> is an optical disc <b>101</b> of four different standards of optical discs, BD <b>101</b><i>a</i>, HD-DVD <b>101</b><i>b</i>, DVD <b>101</b><i>c</i>, and CD <b>101</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A blue-violet laser beam with an oval shape of intensity distribution emitted from the light source <b>102</b> is converted into a beam substantially a circular shape of the intensity distribution by a beam shaping part <b>103</b>. The laser beam released from the beam shaping part <b>103</b> is then directed to a diffraction grating <b>104</b> where diffracted light components are produced for controlling the tracking action with a differential push pull (DPP) technique, passed through a polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b>, and converted into a collimated light beam by a collimator lens <b>106</b>. Then part of the laser beam released from the beam shaping part <b>103</b> is entered into a monitor optical detector <b>108</b> by a dichroic mirror <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The laser beam passed through the dichroic mirror <b>107</b> is passed through a spherical aberration compensating system <b>109</b>. The spherical aberration compensating system <b>109</b> has a function of compensating the spherical aberration caused by a variation in the thickness of the transparent substrate of the optical disc of particularly the BD standard. The laser beam released from the spherical aberration compensating system <b>109</b> is bent to substantially 90 degrees in the optical axis by a riser mirror <b>110</b> and then passed through a &#xbc; waveplate <b>111</b><i>a </i>or <b>111</b><i>b</i>. The laser beam passed through the &#xbc; waveplate <b>111</b><i>a </i>is focused by an objective lens <b>112</b><i>a </i>to form its spot on the information recording surface of a BD <b>101</b><i>a</i>. The laser beam passed through the &#xbc; waveplate <b>111</b><i>b </i>is focused by an objective lens <b>112</b><i>b </i>to form its spot on the information recording surface of an HD-DVD <b>101</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For ease of the description, the optical axis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref> is turned through 90 degrees in relation to the paper surface between the spherical aberration compensating system <b>109</b> and the riser mirror <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The &#xbc; waveplates <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b </i>and the objective lenses <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>are mounted on and driven together by an actuator <b>114</b> in order to follow surface undulations and data track eccentricities of any of the optical discs <b>101</b><i>a </i>to <b>101</b><i>d</i>. Also, the objective lenses <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>disposed on the actuator <b>114</b> for performing either the recording action or the playback action can be switched from one to the other by turning an objective lenses mount about its optical axis for scanning the BD <b>101</b><i>a </i>or the HD-DVD <b>101</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The laser beam reflected by the BD <b>101</b><i>a </i>or the HD-DVD <b>101</b><i>b </i>is passed back through the objective lens <b>112</b><i>a </i>or <b>112</b><i>b </i>and received by the &#xbc; waveplate <b>111</b><i>a </i>or <b>111</b><i>b </i>where it is shifted to a linearly polarized light which is different from that at the advancing path. The laser beam is further passed through the riser mirror <b>110</b>, the spherical aberration compensating system <b>109</b>, the dichroic mirror <b>107</b>, and the collimator lens <b>106</b> before reflected by the polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b>. The laser beam reflected by the polarizing beam splitter <b>105</b> is projected on an optical detector <b>116</b> by a detecting part <b>115</b>. The optical detector <b>116</b> is provided for detecting the focusing error signal, the tracking error signal, and the data signals recorded on the BD <b>101</b><i>a </i>or the HD-DVD <b>101</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The recording action and the playback action on the DVD <b>101</b><i>c </i>will now be described.

For example, disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2001-344803 is an optical pickup for selectively switching the optical path of laser beam with the use of a polarization converter and a polarizing beam splitter.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An optical pickup <b>250</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref> where a blue-violet laser beam emitted from a first light source <b>201</b> is converted into a collimated light beam by a collimator lens <b>202</b>. The collimated laser beam is passed through a polarization converter <b>203</b>. When the laser beam emitted from the light source <b>201</b> is of polarized laser beam A (of which the direction of polarization extends upwardly and downwardly in the drawing), it directly passes through the polarization converter <b>203</b> which remains not in action. The polarized laser beam A of the laser beam is then passed through a dichroic mirror <b>205</b> and received by a polarizing beam splitter <b>213</b>. The polarized laser beam A of the laser beam passed through the polarizing beam splitter <b>213</b> is converted into a circularly polarized laser beam By a &#xbc; waveplate <b>212</b> and then focused by a first objective lens <b>211</b> to form its spot on the information recording surface of an optical disc corresponding to the first optical lens <b>211</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The polarization converter <b>203</b> in the optical pickup <b>250</b> plays an important role. The polarization converter <b>203</b> may be implemented by a liquid crystal device or a transparent piezoelectric device. An example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref> where the polarization converter <b>203</b> is implemented by a liquid crystal device which lines up in a direction denoted by OD with respect to the optical axis. With its electrodes <b>208</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>, loaded with a voltage, the polarization converter <b>203</b> converts the laser beam from the polarized laser beam A to a polarized laser beam B. With its electrodes <b>208</b> remaining loaded with no voltage, the polarization converter <b>203</b> passes the polarized laser beam A without changing the direction of polarization. When the polarization converter <b>203</b> is in action, it converts the laser beam to the polarized laser beam B (of which the direction of polarization extends vertical to the paper surface in the drawing) which is turned through 90 degrees in the direction of polarization from the incident beam. This allows the laser beam to be reflected by the polarizing beam splitter <b>213</b>, converted into a circularly polarized laser beam By the &#xbc; waveplate <b>210</b>, and focused by a second objective lens <b>209</b> to form its spot on the information recording surface of an optical disc corresponding to the second objective lens <b>209</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Also, a red laser beam emitted from a second light source <b>207</b> for performing either the recording action or the playback action on the DVD is of polarized laser beam B.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, according to the conventional constructions, for example, the optical pickup <b>150</b> disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2006-147075 employs an axis rotating type of the actuator <b>114</b>. Such axis rotating type of the actuator <b>114</b> is hardly tilted in relation to the optical system, hence failing to compensate the comatic aberration caused by a difference between the optical discs or a deflection of the optical disc which results from an abrupt change in the temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The JP-'075 also describes the arrangement of an actuator for sliding and switching the objective lens along the circumferential direction of an optical disc by the action of a feed motor and a gear mechanism or a piezoelectric device or the like. The arrangement permits the actuator of a so-called wire suspension type to be employed thus to compensate the comatic aberration. However, the problem arises that the mechanism for sliding the actuator at high accuracy may be too intricate to simplify the structure of an optical pickup.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2001-344803 discloses the optical pickup which is favorably compatible with conventional DVDs and CDs. It is however necessary for performing either the recording action or the playback action on an optical disc of the advanced BD standard to prepare a particular arrangement for compensating the comatic aberration derived from variations of the thickness of the transparent substrate in different production lots or for the two or more recording layers of the optical disc. One of such particular arrangements is known, for example, where the collimator lens is moved along the optical axis of a laser beam until the laser beam entering into the objective lens shifts to a diverged or converged light thus to form a degree of spherical aberration at the opposite polarity in the objective lens which is then used for eliminating the intrinsic spherical aberration.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">However, the optical pickup <b>250</b> disclosed in the JP-'803 allows the collimator lens <b>202</b>, which is arranged movable along the optical axis, to be disposed across only the advancing path, whereby the movement along the optical axis of the laser beam of the collimator lens <b>202</b> for compensating the spherical aberration will cause the optical system at the returning path to receive the diverged or converged light of the laser beam thus producing a defocusing effect and a spherical aberration on the optical detector <b>215</b>. This results in an offset in the focusing error signal, hence declining the performance during the recording action or the playback action on the optical disc. The arrangement disclosed in the JP-'803 provides no measure to overcome the above problem.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is hence an object of the present invention to provide an optical pickup arranged for optically switching the light path of a laser beam with no switching action of objective lenses in order to have a compatible characteristic for recording and playing back different types, such as CD, DVD, BD, and HD-DVD, of the optical disc through focusing three different types of the laser beam by two objective lenses and simultaneously for suppressing declination of the performance during the recording action or the playback action on the optical disc.</p>

This prevents unwanted defocusing or spherical aberration from occurring on the photo detector. As the result, the focusing error signal will be protected from having any offset, thus inhibiting declination of the performance during the recording action or the playback action on the optical disc.</p>

<p id="p-0193" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> are schematic views of the optical pickup according to one embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref> are block diagrams of a primary structural arrangement of the optical pickup shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. The optical pickup shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is arranged capable of operating both a first information recording medium <b>50</b> of optical disc form and a second information recording medium <b>60</b> of optical disc form with the use of a laser beam having a wavelength &#x3bb;<b>1</b>. The optical pickup shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is arranged to be used compatible with three, second, third, and fourth, information recording mediums <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>80</b> of optical disc form as well as the first information recording medium <b>50</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the optical pickup includes a couple of light sources <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>, a first coupling lens <b>5</b>, a first objective lens <b>9</b>, a second coupling lens <b>6</b>, a second objective lens <b>10</b>, and a pair of light path switching units <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>. The optical pickup of the embodiment of the present invention will then be described referring to the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The first coupling lens <b>5</b> and the first objective lens <b>9</b> are arranged to form a first light path for the first information recording medium <b>50</b> while the second coupling lens <b>6</b> and the second objective lens <b>10</b> form a second light path for the second, third, and fourth information recording mediums <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>80</b>. Alternatively, the arrangement of the first coupling lens <b>5</b> and the first objective lens <b>9</b> may be modified for accessing the third and fourth information recording mediums <b>70</b>, <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The light path switching units <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are disposed closer to the light sources <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>than to the first and second coupling lenses <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> for switching between the transmission and the reflection of a first laser beam (denoted by the straight line) emitted from the first light source <b>1</b><i>a </i>in order to guide the first laser beam to the first light path or the second light path. More particularly, for performing either the recording action or the playback action on the first information recording medium <b>50</b>, the first information recording medium <b>50</b> is set to face the first objective lens <b>9</b> and the light path switching units <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are operated to guide the first laser beam along the first light path. For performing either the recording action or the playback action on the second information recording medium <b>60</b>, the second information recording medium <b>60</b> is set to face the second objective lens <b>10</b> for guiding the first laser beam along the second light path.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">For performing either the recording action or the playback action on the third <b>70</b> or fourth information recording medium <b>80</b> which is set to face the second objective lens <b>10</b>, the light path switching units <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are operated to guide the second or third laser beam (denoted by the dotted or one-dot chain line) emitted from the light source <b>1</b><i>b </i>along the second light path. For performing either the recording action or the playback action on the third <b>70</b> or fourth information recording medium <b>80</b> which is set to face the first objective lens <b>9</b>, the light path switching units <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are operated to guide the second or third laser beam (denoted by the dotted or one-dot chain line) emitted from the light source <b>1</b><i>b </i>along the first light path. Furthermore, the light path switching units <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> allow the laser beam reflected by any of the first to fourth information recording mediums to pass through the first <b>5</b> or second coupling lens <b>6</b> and fall on an optical detector <b>13</b> which is one example acting as the photo detector.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">The optical pickup of the embodiment of the present invention will further be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, the first light source <b>1</b><i>a </i>is provided for emitting a blue-violet laser beam as the first laser beam while the second light source <b>1</b><i>b </i>is provided for emitting two different wavelengths of the laser beam, a red laser beam as the second laser beam and an infrared laser beam as the third laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Denoted by <b>2</b> is a diffraction grating and denoted by <b>3</b> is a polarization converter such as a liquid crystal device or a transparent piezoelectric device. Denoted by <b>4</b> is a multi-surface prism which has at least two or more optical surfaces in this embodiment. The multi-surface prism <b>4</b> incorporates an example for performing a light path switching prism function. The polarization converter <b>3</b> is disposed between the first light source <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the multi-surface prism <b>4</b>. A combination of the polarization converter <b>3</b> and the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> or more specifically the first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b>, which will be described later, constitutes the above described light path switching unit.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In the optical pickup of this embodiment, the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> has multiple optical surfaces because both the first and second laser beams are used. Meanwhile, the optical pickup shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> is provided for operating compatible with both the first information recording medium <b>50</b> and the second information recording medium <b>60</b> with the use of one single laser beam and therefore its optical face member acting as the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> may have one optical surface. The optical surface in this case is designed to have a polarization-separation characteristic for passing P polarized light and reflecting S polarized light. The P polarized light and the S polarized light are known as commonly defined in the optical technology field. More particularly, the P polarized light has polarization in parallel to a plane on which both the optical axis of incoming light received by the optical surface and the optical axis of outgoing light departing from the optical surface are present. The S polarized light has polarization vertical to the plane. The expression &#x201c;passing the P polarized light&#x201d; covers the passing the laser beam entirely as well as the passing the laser beam mostly. It means that the rate of transmission of the laser beam is not concerned. Similarly, the expression &#x201c;reflecting the S polarized light&#x201d; covers the reflecting the laser beam entirely as well as the reflecting the laser beam mostly. It means that the rate of reflection of the laser beam is not concerned. Since the optical surface has the polarization-separation characteristic described above, the laser beam passed through the optical surface is either P polarized light or S polarized light.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">As explained, the optical face member which functions as the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> is different from the construction of this embodiment, the optical face member basically has to have single optical surface with the polarization-separation characteristic and act as a first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> described beneath.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> is designed to act as a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) for passing almost entirely the polarized laser beam A of blue-violet laser beam (of which the direction of polarization extends parallel to the plane at the drawing) and reflecting almost entirely the polarized laser beam B of the same (of which the direction of polarization extends vertical to the plane at the drawing) while passing almost entirely the red laser beam and the infrared laser beam. A second optical surface <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> is also designed to act as another PBS for passing almost entirely the polarized laser beam A of the red laser beam or the infrared laser beam and reflecting almost entirely the polarized laser beam B of the same while reflecting almost entirely the blue-violet laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">It is noted in this specification that the polarized laser beam A corresponds to the first polarized laser beam and the polarized laser beam B corresponds to the second polarized laser beam. Accordingly, the polarized laser beam A and the polarized laser beam B represent the state of polarization of the laser beam which is held from the emission from the light source to before entering the multi-surface prism <b>4</b>. Since the polarized laser beam A and the polarized laser beam B represent the state of polarization of the laser beam emitted from the light source, there is a case that they may not correspond to the P polarized light or the S polarized light. In this way, the concept of the polarized laser beam A and the polarized laser beam B basically is not identical to the above-described P polarized light or the S polarized light. The description of this specification is however based on the assumption that the polarized laser beam A is substantially of the P polarization light while the polarized laser beam B is substantially of the S polarization light.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In response to different wavelengths of the laser beam employed in this embodiment, the first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>and the second optical surface <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> are faces to be arranged different from each other in the optical characteristic in accordance with the difference of the wavelength of the laser beam. In other words, the first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>and the second optical surface <b>4</b><i>b </i>have an optical characteristic of wavelength dependent polarized light splitting.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">There are also provided a first collimator lens <b>5</b> acting as the coupling lens for collimating at least the blue-violet laser beam and a second collimator lens <b>6</b> acting as the coupling lens for collimating a plurality of different wavelengths of the laser beam. Denoted by <b>7</b> is an integrated riser mirror for performing the rise of the two optical axes with the use of a single element. Denoted by <b>8</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b </i>are a first &#xbc; waveplate for accepting at least the blue-violet laser beam and a second &#xbc; waveplate for accepting a plurality of different wavelengths of the laser beam respectively. Denoted by <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> are a first objective lens for accepting at least the blue-violet laser beam and a second objective lens for accepting a plurality of different wavelengths of the laser beam respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">There are further provided a detection diffractor <b>11</b>, a first detection lens <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and an integrated optical detector <b>13</b> acting as the photo sensor for receiving all the blue-violet, red, and infrared lights of the laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Denoted by <b>20</b> is a collimator lens actuator for driving both the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> together along the optical axis in this embodiment. Denoted by <b>31</b> is an objective lens actuator for driving a combination of the first objective lens <b>9</b> and the first &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>a</i>, and a combination of the second objective lens <b>10</b> and the second &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>b </i>along the optical axis and along a radial direction of the optical disc which extends vertical to the optical axis. The optical pickup includes the above described components. The objective lenses <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, the detection diffractor <b>11</b>, and the collimator lens actuator <b>20</b> will now be described separately in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">It is noted that the radial direction of the optical disc is denoted by &#x201c;R&#x201d; while the tangential direction of the optical disc is denoted by &#x201c;T&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The optical discs are classified into a first optical disc <b>50</b> arranged to be accessed with the blue-violet laser beam of which the transparent substrate is substantially 0.1 mm in the thickness, a second optical disc <b>60</b> arranged to be accessed with the blue-violet laser beam of which the transparent substrate is substantially 0.6 mm in the thickness, a DVD <b>70</b>, and a CD <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The optical pickup of this embodiment is designed for performing both the recording action and the playback action on the first optical disc <b>50</b> and only the playback action on the second optical disc <b>60</b>. Also, both the recording action and the playback action can be performed on the DVD <b>70</b> and the CD <b>80</b>. However, the optical pickup of this embodiment is not limited to the above described actions. It may be applicable for recording data on the second optical disc <b>60</b> as well.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(First Optical Disc)</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The action of the optical pickup for recording or playing back data on the first optical disc <b>50</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">A blue-violet laser beam <b>51</b> emitted from the light source <b>1</b><i>a </i>and acting as the first laser beam is of linear polarization or the polarized laser beam A. The polarized laser beam A of the laser beam <b>51</b> is passed without changing the direction of polarization through the polarization converter <b>3</b> with its electrodes (not shown) loaded with no voltage and received by the first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b>. The first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>allows the polarized laser beam A of the laser beam <b>51</b> to pass almost entirely. The polarized laser beam A of the laser beam <b>51</b> passed through the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> is transmitted to the first collimator lens <b>5</b> where it is converted to substantially a collimated light beam.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The first collimator lens <b>5</b> is held to a lens holder in the collimator lens actuator <b>20</b>, which will be described later in mode detail referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and can thus be moved along the optical axis of the laser beam by the action of a stepping motor. The polarized laser beam A at substantially the collimated light beam of the laser beam <b>51</b> produced by the first collimator lens <b>5</b> is then bent through substantially 90 degrees in the optical axis by the integrated riser mirror <b>7</b> to run in a direction vertical to the paper surface before entering the first &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>a</i>. The polarized laser beam A of the laser beam <b>51</b> is converted into a circularly polarized laser beam By the first &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>a </i>and, at the advancing path, focused across the transparent substrate by the first objective lens <b>9</b> to form its spot on the information recording surface of the first optical disc <b>50</b>. It is noted that, for ease of the description, the optical axis bent in the direction vertical to the paper surface by the integrated riser mirror <b>7</b> is illustrated to extend in a direction parallel to the paper surface (as is repeated equally hereinafter).</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">When the laser beam is focused to form its spot on the information recording surface of the first optical disc <b>50</b>, it may have a degree of spherical aberration derived from a variation in the thickness of the transparent substrate of the first optical disc <b>50</b>. Such spherical aberration formed depending on the thickness of the transparent substrate can be offset by a degree of spherical aberration at the opposite polarity which is produced by making the laser beam entering the first objective lens <b>9</b> be the diverged or converged light. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the collimator lens actuator <b>20</b> is driven to move the first collimator lens <b>5</b> forward and backward along the optical axis for producing the diverged or converged light of the laser beam before received by the first objective lens <b>9</b>. Accordingly, the spherical aberration at the opposite polarity can be created at the first objective lens <b>9</b> for canceling the spherical aberration derived from the variation in the thickness of the transparent substrate of the optical disc <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">In this manner, the arrangement with the collimator lens actuator <b>20</b> being driven to move the first collimator lens <b>5</b> forward and backward along the optical axis forms a spherical aberration compensating mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Then, the laser beam <b>51</b> acting as the first reflection light after reflected on the information recording surface of the first optical disc <b>50</b> is transmitted along the returning path to the first &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>a </i>where it is converted from the circularly polarized light to a linear polarized light of the polarized laser beam B (of which the direction of polarization extends vertical to the polarized laser beam A to be received by the first &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>a</i>). The polarized laser beam B of the laser beam <b>51</b> in the returning path is then bent by the integrated riser mirror <b>7</b> and converted by the first collimator lens <b>5</b> from substantially the collimated light beam to a converged light before falling on the first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b>. The optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>allows the laser beam <b>51</b> in the returning path to be reflected almost entirely. The laser beam <b>51</b> released along the returning path from the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> is split by the detection diffractor <b>11</b> for detection of a servo signal and provided with a predetermined of spherical aberration by the first detection lens <b>12</b><i>a </i>before received by the integrated optical detector <b>13</b>. The integrated optical detector <b>13</b> then produces the data signal and the servo signal from the polarized laser beam B of the laser beam <b>51</b> which has been received.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The first &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>a</i>, the second &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>b</i>, the first objective lens <b>9</b>, and the second objective lens <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are mounted together on the objective lens actuator <b>31</b> for being driven at once to follow surface undulations and data track eccentricities of the first optical disc <b>50</b>. This allows the same effective diameter to be obtained at the first &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the second &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>b </i>and minimized in the effective diameter even if the objective lenses <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> are shifted. Alternatively, when its effective diameter is slightly increased, the first &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>a </i>may be disposed not on the objective lens actuator <b>31</b>. In the latter case, the objective lens actuator <b>31</b> can be decreased in the weight particularly at its movable region, hence contributing to the recording action and the playback action at higher speeds on the optical disc.</p>

<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The action of the optical pick for recording or playing back data on the second optical disc <b>60</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">A blue-violet laser beam <b>61</b>, similar to the laser beam <b>51</b>, emitted from the light source <b>1</b><i>a </i>and acting as the first laser beam is of linear polarization or the polarized laser beam A. With its electrodes (not shown) loaded with a voltage, the polarization converter <b>3</b> converts the laser beam <b>61</b> from the polarized laser beam A to the polarized laser beam B. The polarized laser beam B of the laser beam <b>61</b> is then received by the first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b>. The first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>allows the polarized laser beam B of the laser beam <b>61</b> to be reflected almost entirely and bent at its light path before received by the second optical surface <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b>. The polarized laser beam B of the laser beam <b>61</b> is further reflected and bent at its light path by the second optical surface <b>4</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0220" num="0219">It is also possible that the collimator lens actuator <b>20</b> is driven to move the second collimator lens <b>6</b> forward and backward along the optical axis for producing the diverged or converged light of the laser beam which is received by the second objective lens <b>10</b> so that the spherical aberration derived from a variation in the thickness of the transparent substrate of the second optical disc <b>60</b> can be canceled.

<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Then, the polarized laser beam B of the laser beam <b>61</b> acting as the second reflection light after reflected on the information recording surface of the second optical disc <b>60</b> is transmitted to the second &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>b </i>where it is converted from the circularly polarized light to the polarized light A.

<p id="p-0229" num="0228">In particular, the first objective lens <b>9</b> is a specific objective lens selected for performing either the recording action or the playback action on the first optical disc <b>50</b>.

<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The second objective lens <b>10</b> is arranged to have at least one surface thereof, preferably the incident surface (at the light source side) in this embodiment, arranged of a blazing diffraction construction with a saw-tooth like pattern in the cross section for focusing the second optical disc <b>60</b>, the DVD <b>70</b>, and the CD <b>80</b> respectively. The blazing diffraction construction is aberration compensated so that laser beam of a corresponding wavelength is focused, in combination with the power of refraction of the second objective lens <b>10</b>, at the diffraction limit on each of the second optical disc <b>60</b>, the DVD <b>70</b>, and the CD <b>80</b> to be recorded or played back. The second objective lens <b>10</b> with the blazing diffraction construction for diffracting a portion of the incident light allows the laser beam to be spotted at the diffraction limit on each of the different types of the optical disc which are different in the thickness of the transparent substrate. Also, the second objective lens <b>10</b> is configured for permitting the infrared laser beam to be focused on the CD <b>80</b> through a center region, including the optical axis, of the objective lens <b>10</b> and both the blue-violet laser beam and the red laser beam to be focused on the second optical disc <b>60</b> or the DVD <b>70</b> through the center region and outer region of the objective lens <b>10</b>. This allows the numerical aperture to be limited to about 0.45 for the CD <b>80</b> and set incrementally to about 0.65 for the second optical disc <b>60</b> and the DVD <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">The second objective lens <b>10</b> is not limited to the arrangement with the blazing diffraction construction at the incident surface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> but may be modified to a combination of an objective lens <b>10</b><i>a </i>of a refractive type with positive power and a hologram lens <b>10</b><i>b </i>provided separately, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, for being driven at once in either the recording action or the playback action on to each of the second optical disc <b>60</b>, the DVD <b>70</b>, and the CD <b>80</b>.

<p id="p-0240" num="0239">The collimator lens actuator <b>20</b> in this embodiment will now be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic structural view of the collimator lens actuator <b>20</b>. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are the first collimator lens <b>5</b>, the second collimator lens <b>6</b>, a stepping motor <b>21</b>, a screw shaft <b>22</b>, a lens holder <b>23</b>, a main shaft <b>24</b>, and a sub shaft <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the rotating action of the screw shaft <b>22</b> driven by the stepping motor <b>21</b> permits the lens holder <b>23</b> carrying the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> together to be moved between the main shaft <b>24</b> and the sub shaft <b>25</b> along the optical axes of both the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">When the first collimator lens <b>5</b> is moved from the reference position, where outgoing light of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> is at substantially a collimated light beam, towards the light source <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the outgoing light turns to a diverged light, whereby the spherical aberration derived from the increasing of thickness of the transparent substrate of the first optical disc <b>50</b> can be canceled. On the other hand, when the first collimator lens <b>5</b> is moved towards the objective lens <b>9</b>, the outgoing light turns to a converged light, whereby the spherical aberration derived from the decreasing of thickness of the transparent substrate of the first optical disc <b>50</b> can be canceled. The action of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> produces an equal effect for compensating the spherical aberration derived from variations in the thickness of the transparent substrate of the second optical disc <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">The parts for moving the first collimator lens <b>5</b> along the optical axis is not limited to the arrangement with the stepping motor <b>21</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> but may be implemented by any applicable actuator mechanism such as a magnetic system or a piezoelectric system. Since the former parts using the stepping motor requires no monitoring of the location of the collimator lens <b>5</b> along its optical axis, its overall arrangement can be simplified. As the latter actuator mechanism using a magnetic system or a piezoelectric system is minimized in the driving mechanism, it can contribute to the size reduction of the optical pickup.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Generally speaking, the second optical disc <b>60</b> is smaller in the incidence rate of spherical aberration derived from variations in the thickness of the transparent substrate than the first optical disc <b>50</b>. Accordingly, provided that the spherical aberration derived from the second optical disc <b>60</b> is negligible, the second collimator lens <b>6</b> may not be mounted on the lens holder <b>23</b> of the collimator lens actuator <b>20</b> provided for moving the lens along its optical axis. In this case, the collimator lens actuator <b>20</b> is designed for moving only the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and can thus be minimized in the overall dimensions. This will contribute to the size reduction as well as the cost down of the optical pickup.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Meanwhile, when both the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> are mounted together on the same lens holder <b>23</b>, the distance between the optical axis of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the optical axis of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> can be decreased. As the result, the distance between the first objective lens <b>9</b> and the second objective lens <b>10</b> can be reduced thus permitting the movable region of the objective lens actuator <b>31</b> to be minimized in both the size and the weight. Accordingly, the recording action and the playback action at higher speeds on the optical disc can be more facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The second objective lens <b>10</b> may be arranged to receive a diverged light of the laser beam in view of the fact that, when performing the recording action or the playback action on the CD <b>80</b>, the second objective lens <b>10</b> fails to cancel the spherical aberration because the thickness of the transparent substrate of the CD <b>80</b> is relatively large or that the working distance (WD) is maintained sufficiently. For the purpose, the collimator lens actuator <b>20</b> is moved towards the light source <b>1</b><i>b </i>to convert the infrared laser beam into a diverged light. This allows the arrangement of the collimator lens actuator <b>20</b> for compensating the spherical aberration derive from variations in the thickness of the transparent substrate of the first optical disc <b>50</b> to be shared and the laser beam source <b>1</b><i>b </i>for emitting two different wavelengths, red color light and infrared light, of the laser beam which are substantially equal at the emission point to be used with no modification, thus contributing to the structural simplification of the optical pickup.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">The first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> may be manufactured separately and mounted at accurate positioning on the lens holder <b>23</b>. Alternatively, the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> may be manufactured integrally while their manufacturing and positioning steps are reduced. For example, when the first <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> are shaped to such a binocular lens as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the distance L between them can be smaller, thus contributing to the downsizing of the optical pickup. Also, the glass material can be reduced or a gate G for injection forming, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, may be provided at the location which is not interfered by the mounting surface of the lens holder <b>23</b>. In case that the integrated collimator lens is employed, its shape may be arranged of such an oval form as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. This oval shape will be favorable for flowing of the material at the injection step as compared with the binocular lens type of the integrated collimator lens, thus reducing the residual aberration of the lens.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">It is assumed in this embodiment that the first laser beam and the second laser beam converted into substantially the collimated light beams by the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> which have been manufactured in a single unit are bent by the integrated riser mirror <b>7</b> and received by the first objective lens <b>9</b> and the second objective lens <b>10</b> respectively. This allows the distance L between the optical axis of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the optical axis of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> to be equal to the distance between the optical axis of the first objective lens <b>9</b> and the optical axis of the second objective lens <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">The first objective lens <b>9</b> and the second objective lens <b>10</b> have to be designed for best matching the corresponding different types of the optical disc. Accordingly, if the first objective lens <b>9</b> and the second objective lens <b>10</b> are different from each other in the glass material, they can hardly be manufactured in a single unit. Even if their glass materials are equal, since each of the two objective lenses has to be high in the aberration property and is asymmetrical about the optical axis, they will thus be manufactured in a single unit with much difficulty.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Accordingly in practice, the first objective lens <b>9</b> and the second objective lens <b>10</b> are manufactured separately. The manufacturing of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> in the form of an integrated collimator lens assembly by a single molding method is conditioned, in view of the distance L between their optical axes, that the circumference of the first objective lens <b>9</b> does not overlap the circumference of the second objective lens <b>10</b>. More specifically, assuming that the diameter of the first objective lens <b>9</b> is Do<b>1</b> and the diameter of the second objective lens <b>10</b> is Do<b>2</b>, the distance L between the optical axis of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the optical axis of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> is satisfied if L&#x2267;(Do<b>1</b>/2)+(Do<b>2</b>/2).</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">The manufacturing of the collimator lenses in a single unit is conditioned that the effective diameter of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the effective diameter of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> does not overlap each other. The effective diameter of the collimator lens is equivalent to a diameter of a region where the aberration property of the laser beam passing action the collimator lens is ensured. More specifically, assuming that the effective diameter of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> is De<b>1</b> and the effective diameter of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> is De<b>2</b>, the distance L between the optical axis of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the optical axis of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> is satisfied if L&#x2267;(De<b>1</b>/2)+(De<b>2</b>/2).</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">When the distance L between the optical axis of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the optical axis of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> is too large as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the advantage of the integrated collimator lens will decline. Accordingly, the integrated collimator lens may favorably be employed in this embodiment only when the distance L between the optical axis of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the optical axis of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> is determined by L&#x3c;(r<b>1</b>+r<b>2</b>) where r<b>1</b> is the distance (equivalent to the radius of the first collimator lens <b>5</b>) between the optical axis of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the point X<b>1</b>, and r<b>2</b> is the distance (equivalent to the radius of the second collimator lens <b>6</b>) between the optical axis of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> and the point X<b>2</b>. The point X<b>1</b> is the intersection between an edge of the circumference of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the line Z extending between the optical axis of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the optical axis of the second collimator lens <b>6</b>. The point X<b>2</b> is the intersection between an edge of the circumference of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> and the line Z.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Alternatively, the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> may be located as dislocated from each other along their optical axes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, when the distance L between the optical axis of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the optical axis of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> is determined by L&#x3c;(Dc<b>1</b>/2)+(Dc<b>2</b>/2) where Dc<b>1</b> is the diameter of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and Dc<b>2</b> is the diameter of the second collimator lens <b>6</b>. This will reduce the distance L, thus contributing to the down sizing of the optical pickup.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Some modifications of the optical pickup of Embodiment 1 will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a first prism <b>41</b> and a second prism <b>42</b> which have single optical surfaces respectively of the same function and act as the first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>and the second optical surface <b>4</b><i>b </i>respectively of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">In this modification, the optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the first prism <b>41</b> and the optical surface <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the second prism <b>42</b> are arranged separately adjustable at the angle so as to align the advancing path with the returning path along their optical axes at more accuracy, hence contributing to the higher performance of the optical pickup. If the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> is employed, the two reflective surfaces <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>may be designed at a higher degree of parallelism, whereby the adjustment of the angle of the prism can be eased or eliminated. Also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the integrated riser mirror <b>7</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> is configured by a first riser mirror <b>7</b><i>a </i>and a second riser mirror <b>7</b><i>b</i>. If the integrated riser mirror <b>7</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> is employed, the two reflective surfaces are implemented by a single unit, thus contributing to the down sizing of the optical pickup. Meanwhile, when the two separate riser mirrors <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>are employed, the second riser mirror <b>7</b><i>b </i>has to have discrete reflective surfaces for reflecting three different wavelengths of the blue-violet light, the red light, and the infrared light of the laser beam. The first riser mirror <b>7</b><i>a </i>is, however, arranged simply for reflecting the wavelength of the blue-violet light, an area of the coating for reflecting the three different wavelength of the laser beam which is manufactured with much difficulty can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a second bending mirror <b>14</b><i>b </i>provided in the optical path between the second collimator lens <b>6</b> and the second objective lens <b>10</b> while the optical axes of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> are arranged to extend in the tangential directions. In this modification, the overall size of the optical pickup can be reduced along the radial direction, thus contributing to the down sizing of the optical disc apparatus installed in the optical pickup.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a structure where the light source <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the integrated optical detector <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are reversed in the location. Accordingly, the polarization converter <b>3</b>, the detection diffraction grating <b>11</b>, and the first detection lens <b>12</b><i>a </i>are also placed in different locations. In the modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first light source <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the second light source <b>1</b><i>b </i>are located close to each other thus to minimize the distance in electric circuit from a laser driver IC for driving the semiconductor lasers in the light sources <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>, hence permitting the driving signal to be received by the semiconductor lasers quickly and accurately. In the modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the light source <b>1</b><i>a </i>which is a heat generating part is disposed just beneath the optical disc to be recorded or played back and can thus be cooled down effectively by a flow of ambient air generated by the rotation of the optical disc.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">The optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>is commonly formed with an optical coating having a polarized light splitting property. When the optical coating is exposed to the blue-violet light at higher intensity of the laser beam for more than a period of time, its optical properties including the light transmittance of the optical coating and the wavefront aberration will decline. Even if the incident light is at higher intensity, the reflection is involved at the optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>thus preventing the optical surface from declining in the optical properties. Moreover, when the incident light is low in the intensity, for example, during the playback action, the optical properties may hardly be declined by the transmission of the light. Accordingly, it is preferable in the modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> that the first optical disc <b>50</b> is to be recorded or played back using the blue-violet laser beam <b>51</b> while the second optical disc <b>60</b> is to be played back using the blue-violet laser beam <b>61</b>. This will prevent the optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>from receiving the laser beam at higher intensity during the recording action of the first optical disc <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a first bending mirror <b>14</b><i>a </i>provided in the optical path between the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the first objective lens <b>9</b> in addition to the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In this modification, the optical axes of the first and second collimator lenses <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> are arranged to extend in tangential directions, thus reducing the size along the radial direction of the optical pickup. With the integrated riser mirror <b>7</b> employed as a riser mirror, the optical pickup can further be decreased in the overall size.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates where the optical axis of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the optical axis of the second collimator lens <b>6</b> are reversed at the location in the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In response, the other components along each optical axis are placed in corresponding locations. In this modification, the two light sources <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the optical detector <b>13</b> all in the optical pickup are arranged to face the outer edge of the optical disc. This allows the two light sources <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the optical detector <b>13</b> to be adjustably positioned at ease with the optical disc being rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">Further modifications may be made as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> illustrates a further bending mirror <b>14</b><i>c </i>provided in the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> for substantially aligning the light axis entering the riser mirror <b>7</b><i>b </i>with the optical axis of the laser beam incident on the riser mirror <b>7</b><i>a</i>. In this modification, the two bending mirrors <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>are arranged one behind the other, thus allowing their arrangement to be simplified or implemented by a single riser prism assembly (not shown) which has two riser mirror surfaces <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>thus for reducing the number of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">Also in this modification, the light path across the collimator lens <b>6</b> overlaps the objective lens actuator <b>31</b> in the plane of the drawing. However, the objective lens actuator <b>31</b> is dislocated along the height direction of the optical pickup or the thicknesswise direction of the optical disc as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. This construction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> has the advantage when the thickness of the optical pickup has some margin.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> illustrates the optical axes of the two collimator lenses <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> distanced from each other by a desirable length. This allows the light path to extend off the objective lens actuator <b>31</b> in the plan view, thus ensuring an advantageous feature for the thinning of the optical pickup.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Modifications shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref> are identical to the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> except that the light sources <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the optical detector <b>13</b> are placed at different locations, so that the same effects as described can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, the collimator lens actuator <b>20</b> may be modified for simultaneously moving the two collimator lenses <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> of which the optical axes are desirably distanced from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates the optical axes of the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> in the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> tilted at substantially 45 degrees to the radial direction of the optical disc. In general, the distribution of intensity at a far-field pattern of the laser beam emitted from a semiconductor laser exhibits an oval shape of which the minor axis aligns with the direction of linear polarization. In a common optical pickup, the optical system like that of this embodiment is arranged for splitting the light path with the use of the direction of linear polarization of the light beam. For optimizing the splitting effect with the linear polarization, the direction of polarization of the laser beam received by the beam splitter is preferably aligned with the radial direction R or the tangential direction T of the optical disc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> illustrates a distribution of the intensity of the laser beam released from the objective lens in this modification.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">Denoted by <b>32</b> is an aperture provided in the objective lens actuator <b>31</b>. For passing the laser beam at an oval intensity distribution through the aperture <b>32</b> of substantially a circle shape, the RIM intensity (a ratio of the maximum intensity to the pupil edge intensity at the output of the objective lens) of the laser beam after passing the aperture <b>32</b> is set different between the direction R and the direction T. The optical axes are then tilted at 45 degrees as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> for reducing the difference in the RIM intensity between the two directions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> illustrates a distribution of the intensity of the laser beam released from the objective lens in this modification. As the far field pattern of the laser beam is turned to 45 degrees in the aperture <b>32</b>, the difference in the RIM intensity between the two directions R and T is favorably decreased. Accordingly, the spot of the laser beam produced on the information recording surface of the optical disc appears higher in the roundness than that of the modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, hence contributing to the improvement of the performance during the action of recording or playing back the optical disc.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">In the modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the direction of the polarization of the laser beam received by the beam splitter such as the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> is equal to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, thus ensuring the splitting of the light path at optimum due to the polarization.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">As explained roughly but not precisely, a beam shaper element (which has, for example, two cylindrical surfaces or non-cylindrical surfaces) may be employed for shifting the distribution of the intensity at the far field pattern of the laser beam from an oval shape to a round shape. This can also reduce the RIM intensity along the directions R and T of the laser beam passing through the aperture <b>32</b> even if the optical axes of the collimator lenses are aligned with the radial direction R or the tangential direction T as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. For example, the beam shaper element may be disposed between the light source <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the polarization converter <b>3</b> in the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Since the efficiency of use of the laser beam emitted from its light source is increased by the action of the beam shaper element, the optical pickup can respond to the recording action or the playback action at high speeds on the optical disc and reduce the power consumption due to the higher efficiency of use of the laser beam emitted from the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">As explained roughly but not precisely, the light source itself may be turned to substantially 45 degrees about the optical axis so as to have the distribution of the intensity at a far-field pattern of the laser beam turned to 45 degrees just after the emission from the light source. In addition, a relevant element such as a half-waveplate is provided across the optical path for determining a desired direction of the polarization, whereby the same effect as of the modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> will be ensured. In this modification, the optical axes of the collimator lenses need not to be tilted to substantially 45 degrees unlike the modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, thus allowing the optical pickup to be reduced in the size along the radial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">In this modification, the first optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> is designed for transmitting almost entirely the polarized laser beam A of the blue-violet laser beam while reflecting almost entirely the polarized laser beam B. When the polarized laser beam A and the polarized laser beam B are of the P polarization light and the S polarization light respectively, the polarized light splitting surfaces can be prepared at a simpler arrangement and with much ease. For the equal reason, the optical surface <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the polarized light splitting property for the red laser beam or the infrared laser beam may be prepared simply and easily when the polarized laser beam A to be transmitted almost entirely and the polarized laser beam B to be reflected almost entirely are of the P polarization light and the S polarization light respectively. Alternatively, in case that the laser beam is partially transmitted through for the purpose of monitoring the emission of the light source while reflected mostly by the polarized light splitting layer, the two optical surfaces <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>may be arranged to reflect the P polarized light and transmit the S polarized light. This modification for monitoring the emission quantity of the laser beam by transmitting a portion of the P polarized light will be easier in the polarized light splitting layer construction than the others.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">The arrangement for monitoring the emission quantity of the laser beam from the light source will be described later in more detail in conjunction with Embodiment 9.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">For performing the recording action and the playback action on any of the first optical disc <b>50</b>, the second optical disc <b>60</b>, the DVD <b>70</b>, and the CD <b>80</b>, the present invention is not limited to the objective lens arrangement of Embodiment 1 where the first objective lens <b>9</b> is used for performing the recording action or the playback action on the first optical disc <b>50</b> while the second objective lens <b>10</b> is used for performing the recording or the playback action on each of the second optical disc <b>60</b>, the DVD <b>70</b>, and the CD <b>80</b>. The present invention is equally applicable to, for example, an arrangement where the recording action and the playback action on the first optical disc <b>50</b> and the CD <b>80</b> are performed through the first objective lens <b>9</b> while those on the second optical disc <b>60</b> and the DVD <b>70</b> are performed through the second objective lens <b>10</b> or another arrangement where the recording action and the playback action on the first optical disc <b>50</b> and the DVD <b>70</b> are performed through the first objective lens <b>9</b> while those on the second optical disc <b>60</b> and the CD <b>80</b> are performed through the second objective lens <b>10</b>. In brief, the first optical disc <b>50</b> and the second optical disc <b>60</b> are assigned to their respective objective lenses for performing the recording and playback actions. In this modification, their relevant optical components such as the reflective coating at the optical surfaces are arranged to match the wavelengths of the laser beam emitted from each light source.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Although the two different wavelengths of the laser beams emitted from the light source <b>1</b><i>b </i>are of the red color laser beam and the infrared laser beam respectively in Embodiment 1, they may be emitted from a red laser light source and an infrared laser light source separately. When the two, red laser and infrared laser, light sources of a single wavelength are provided separately, their cost will be declined significantly. Also, there may separately be provided a pair of light sources for emitting a blue-violet laser beam at high power to be used for performing either the recording action or the playback action on the first optical disc <b>50</b> and for emitting a blue-violet laser beam at low power to be used for performing only the playback action on the second optical disc <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Moreover while the light source <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the light source <b>1</b><i>b </i>in Embodiment 1 are provided separately, they may be combined to a single unit for emitting the first to third laser beams.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Throughout the modifications shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 13</figref>, the two collimator lenses may be driven separately or at once by a modified arrangement of the collimator lens actuator. In this case, the first collimator lens <b>5</b> and the second collimator lens <b>6</b> may be implemented separately or combined to an integrated unit with equal advantage.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">The two objective lenses in this embodiment are arranged along the tangential direction. This allows the optical pickup to hardly strike against the spindle motor during the action of accessing the innermost end of the optical disc with the use of any of the two objective lenses. Its optical system having the objective lenses disposed along the radial line (known as a seek center line) which extends across the center of the optical disc may hence utilize the three-beam technique (or the DPP technique) with ease for producing the tracking control signal. If the objective lenses in the optical system are arranged not along the seek center line, the one-beam technique may be employed for generation of the tracking control signal as will be described in no mode detail.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">The optical disc such as the DVD <b>70</b> has a rib, called a stack ring, at a thickness of some hundreds micrometers provided on the inner edge (at the outside of the clamp region) thereof for preventing the optical discs in a stack from coming into direct contact with one another at their light incident surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">Since the first objective lens <b>10</b><i>a </i>is greater in the numerical aperture NA than the second objective lens <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the focal distance of the first objective lens <b>10</b><i>a </i>remains short and its working distance WD from the optical disc also becomes short. Accordingly, if the first objective lens <b>10</b><i>a </i>is located at the inner side of the optical disc than the second objective lens <b>10</b><i>b</i>, it may be disturbed by the stack ring against the first objective lens <b>10</b><i>a </i>during the action of the second objective lens <b>10</b><i>b </i>for accessing the innermost end of the optical disc to record and play back data on optical disc.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">For avoiding such a drawback, the first objective lens <b>10</b><i>a </i>which is smaller in the working distance WD is preferably located at the outer side of the optical disc than the second objective lens <b>10</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60 and 61</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">This modification protects the second objective lens <b>10</b><i>b </i>which is greater in the working distance WD from being interrupted by the stack ring when the first objective lens <b>10</b><i>a </i>accesses the innermost end of the optical disc <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">When the two objective lenses are arranged in the radial direction, they extend along the seek center line and can thus allow the three-beam technique (or the DPP technique) to be employed at ease in their optical systems. As general, the two objective lenses may be arranged either in the radial direction or in the tangential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 to 43</figref> illustrate a modification where the two objective lenses <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> are arranged in the radial direction to extend along the seek center line and can thus employ the three-beam technique (or the DPP technique) in their optical systems. In this modification, the arrangement along the radial direction may be replaced with equal success by that along the tangential direction. Accordingly, the two objective lenses <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> may be arranged either in the radial direction or in the tangential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">It would be understood that the polarization converter <b>3</b> is not limited to the liquid crystal device or the transparent piezoelectric device described in this embodiment. As will be explained in no more detail, a waveplate actuator may be provided for moving the waveplate to and from the light path or switching between the waveplate and the transparent plate across the light path. Using the waveplates of half-wavelength type, this embodiment may be improved in the performance. However, the arrangement of the waveplates is of no limitations.</p>

<p id="p-0293" num="0292">Then, the laser beam <b>51</b> reflected on the information recording surface of the first optical disc <b>50</b> is transmitted along the returning path to the first &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>a </i>where it is converted from the circularly polarized light to a polarized laser beam A of which the polarization is vertical to that of the polarized laser beam B to be received by the first &#xbc; waveplate <b>8</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0308" num="0307">The optical pickup of Embodiment 2 is capable of performing either the recording action or the playback action on the CD <b>80</b> with the second light source <b>1</b><i>b </i>emitting an infrared laser beam as the third laser beam, one of two different wavelengths to be emitted. The action of the optical pickup for recording and playing back data on the CD <b>80</b> is identical to the action for recording and playing back data on the DVD <b>70</b> described previously with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> and will be described in no more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">For operating the first optical disc <b>50</b>, the arrangement of Embodiment 2 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> may preferably be employed. For operating the second optical disc <b>60</b>, the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> or <b>17</b> may be selected. For operating the DVD <b>70</b> and the CD <b>80</b>, the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> or <b>19</b> may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">For example, with the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> for operating the second optical disc <b>60</b> and the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> for operating the DVD and the CD, the first optical detector <b>13</b><i>a </i>receives two reflected lights of the laser beam from the first optical disc <b>50</b> and the second optical disc <b>60</b>. At the time, the light source <b>1</b><i>a </i>is driven as a single source for performing either the recording action or the playback action on each of the two different discs. As the light source and the optical detector respond at one-to-one relationship to the action of each of the two different optical discs, the positional adjustment of the first optical detector <b>13</b><i>a </i>to the first optical disc <b>50</b>, for example, may equally be applied to the second optical disc <b>60</b>. This will eliminate repeat of the troublesome adjusting action. Also, the second detection lens <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the second optical detector <b>13</b><i>b </i>are provided for operating only the DVD and the CD. As compared with the use of the integrated optical detector <b>13</b> in Embodiment 1, this modification allows the second optical detector <b>13</b><i>b </i>to become less intricate at the arrangement of its photo detector.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">Another modification of this embodiment may be provided when the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> for operating the second optical disc <b>60</b> and the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> for operating the DVD and the CD are selected. In this modification, the first optical detector <b>13</b><i>a </i>is driven for operating the first optical disc <b>50</b> while the second optical detector <b>13</b><i>b </i>is driven for operating the second optical disc <b>60</b>, the DVD <b>70</b>, and the CD <b>80</b>. While the detection diffraction grating <b>11</b> for producing diffracted light for determining the tracking control signal is provided across the light path to the first optical disc <b>50</b>, the action of determining the tracking control signal for the second optical disc <b>60</b> is performed by the phase difference detecting method which requires no diffracted light. When the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> for operating the second optical disc <b>60</b> is selected, the detection light can be received directly by the second optical detector <b>13</b><i>b </i>without being passed through the detection diffraction grating <b>11</b>. Accordingly, as loss of the light by the diffraction is avoided, the playback signal will be increased in the signal to noise ratio. More particularly, the playback signal will be improved in the quality as having received no unwanted interference from the diffracted light produced by the detection diffraction grating <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">A further modification of this embodiment with the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> for recording and playing back the second optical disc <b>60</b> and the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> for recording and playing back the DVD and the CD may be provided where the first optical detector <b>13</b><i>a </i>is dedicated for operating the first optical disc <b>50</b>, the DVD <b>70</b>, and the CD <b>80</b> and the second optical detector <b>13</b><i>b </i>is dedicated for operating the second optical disc <b>60</b>. When the first optical disc <b>50</b>, the DVD <b>70</b>, and the CD <b>80</b> are subjected to both the recording action and the playback action and the second optical disc <b>60</b> is subjected to only the playback action, the first optical detector <b>13</b><i>a </i>needs to have its photosensitive region adapted for measuring a less amount of the light during the playback action and a large amount of the light during the recording action. The second optical detector <b>13</b><i>b </i>is, however, arranged to have its photosensitive region adapted for measuring only a less amount of the light during the playback action. Accordingly, the second optical detector may be simplified in the construction and decreased in the cost, thus contributing to the improvement of the signal to noise ratio easily.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">As described, the optical pickup of Embodiment 2 is a bit higher in the number of the components than that of Embodiment 1 by preparing the third optical surface <b>4</b><i>c </i>of the multi-surface prism <b>4</b> as well as the second detection lens <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the second optical detector <b>13</b><i>b</i>. However, the optical pickup of Embodiment 1 may become intricate in the arrangement of the first detection diffraction grating <b>11</b> for producing a control signal and the photosensitive region pattern of the integrated optical detector <b>13</b> when the reflections of the light from all the first optical disc <b>50</b>, the second optical disc <b>60</b>, the DVD <b>70</b>, and the CD <b>80</b> are to be received by the integrated optical detector <b>13</b>. It is fairly essential for performing the recording action and the playback action at higher speeds to simplify the manufacturing process of the optical detector. The combination of the first optical detector <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the second optical detector <b>13</b><i>b </i>may be manufactured at easier manners with lower cost than the integrated optical detector <b>13</b> as its arrangement is simple.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">Other modifications of the optical pickup of Embodiment 2 are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 to 25</figref>. The advantages of the other modifications are identical to those of the modification of Embodiment 1 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">In addition, further modifications dissimilar to any modification of Embodiment 1 are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref> where the light path is bent to other than 90 degrees by the bending mirror. The arrangement of the optical pickup shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is favorably sized smaller along the radial direction than the modifications shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 20</figref>. The arrangement of the optical pickup shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is favorably sized smaller along the radial direction than the modifications shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">The other arrangements not illustrated in Embodiments 1 and 2 are also fundamentally similar in the advantageous features. The optical detector in Embodiment 1 is implemented by one signal integrated optical detector <b>13</b> and it can contribute to the reduction of the overall number of the components and the downsizing of the optical pickup. Embodiment 2 unlike Embodiment 1 includes two or more optical detectors and allows its photosensitive region to be patterned with much ease. The other embodiments described in Embodiment 1 are effectively realized in Embodiment 2 with equal advantage.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">Although the dichroic property of the third optical surface <b>4</b><i>c </i>is specified for passing almost entirely the blue-violet laser beam and reflecting almost entirely the red laser beam and the infrared laser beam throughout the descriptions, it may be modified with the two light sources reversed in the arrangement where the blue-violet laser beam is almost entirely reflected while the red laser beam and the infrared laser beam are passed almost entirely. In the latter case, the arrangement of Embodiment 2 can remain effective to provide the equal advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">In the embodiments, two different wavelengths of the laser beam emitted from their respective light sources <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>are combined along the optical axis by the third optical surface <b>4</b><i>c </i>and separated again by the optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>or <b>4</b><i>b </i>depending the wavelength and the direction of polarization. Then, the laser beams are guided to respective objective lenses disposed along the different light paths. This allows the two light sources to be located closer to each other, hence minimizing the electric circuitry distance between each light source and the laser driver IC for driving the light source. Accordingly, the drive signal can be transmitted to the light sources quickly and accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">As described, the optical pickup of each of Embodiments 1 and 2 has the light path switching unit disposed between the light source and the coupling lens. Alternatively, the light path switching unit in each of the optical pickups of Embodiments 3 to 9, which will be described beneath in more detail, is disposed between the coupling lens and the objective lens.</p>

The wedge prism <b>1019</b> is less expensive than the dichroic prism <b>1002</b> and hardly forms astigmatism even when a diverged light emitted from a light source is passed through the wedge prism <b>1019</b> in a design. However, the wedge prism <b>1019</b> may create a small degree of astigmatism in the passing light due to a variation in its apex angle.</p>

In such case, as the reflective coating can be changed with respect to each riser mirror, area of the reflective coating for reflecting the three different wavelengths, of which the fabrication is not easy in practice, can be smaller.</p>

<p id="p-0365" num="0364">Meanwhile, the method of detecting the tracking error signal from the first optical disc <b>50</b> which is known as a one-beam tracking error signal detecting method remains not susceptible to a change in the angle of the data tracks during the seek action of the optical pickup <b>1040</b>.

For decreasing the rim intensity along the radial direction of the optical disc and increasing the rim intensity along the tangent direction, the first light source <b>1001</b><i>a </i>is turned through 90 degrees about the optical axis of the laser beam to be emitted from the first light source <b>1001</b><i>a</i>. This causes the blue-violet laser bean emitted from the first light source <b>1001</b><i>a </i>to be of polarized laser beam B (of which the direction of polarization extends vertical to the paper surface in the drawing).</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">Therefore, for performing the recording or playback action of the first optical disc <b>50</b>, the polarization converter <b>1005</b> is loaded with no voltage between its electrodes thus to pass the polarized light B of the blue-violet laser beam therethrough without changing the polarization direction.

<p id="p-0369" num="0368">For having the rim intensity equalized between the radial direction and the tangent direction of the optical disc, the first light source <b>1001</b><i>a </i>is turned through 45 degrees about the optical axis of the laser beam so that the laser beam emitted therefrom is of polarized laser beam A or B while the &#xbd; waveplate is located just after the emitting from the first light source <b>1001</b><i>a </i>for shifting the direction of polarization.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">The rim intensity may be equalized between the radial direction and the tangent direction of the optical disc by not turning the first light source <b>1001</b><i>a </i>along the optical axis of the laser beam but shaping or converting the laser beam emitted from the first light source <b>1001</b><i>a </i>from an oval distribution mode of the intensity to substantially a circular distribution mode with the use of a beam shaping part.

Consequently, the objective lens actuator can be arranged substantially equal in the thickness to the optical platform, thus reducing the thickness of the optical pickup.</p>

<p id="p-0428" num="0427">As described, the optical pickup <b>1049</b> of this embodiment has the first objective lens <b>1010</b><i>a </i>arranged radially of the optical disc in relation to the second objective lens <b>1010</b><i>b</i>, so that the two objective lenses <b>1010</b><i>a</i>, <b>1010</b><i>b </i>are arranged across the seek center line, hence minimizing a change in the angle of the tracks during the seek action of the optical pickup. This allows the tracking error signal on the first optical disc <b>50</b> to be detected by the three-beam method such as the DPP technique.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0428">The optical disc such as the DVD <b>70</b> has a rib, called a stack ring, at a thickness of some hundreds micrometers provided on the inner portion (at the outside of the clamp region) thereof for preventing the optical discs in a stack from coming into direct contact with one another at their light incident surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0429">Since the first objective lens <b>1010</b><i>a </i>is greater in the numerical aperture NA than the second objective lens <b>1010</b><i>b</i>, its focal distance remains short and its working distance WD from the optical disc also becomes short. Accordingly, if the first objective lens <b>101</b><i>a </i>is located at the inner side of the optical disc than the second objective lens <b>1010</b><i>b</i>, the first objective lens <b>1010</b><i>a </i>may be disturbed by the stack ring during the action of the second objective lens <b>1010</b><i>b </i>for accessing the innermost end of the optical disc.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0430">For avoiding such a drawback, the first objective lens <b>1010</b><i>a </i>which is smaller in the working distance WD is preferably located at the outer side of the optical disc than the second objective lens <b>1010</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60 and 61</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0431">This modification protects the second objective lens <b>1010</b><i>b </i>which is greater in the working distance WD from being interrupted by the stack ring when the first objective lens <b>1010</b><i>a </i>accesses the innermost end of the optical disc <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0432">The optical pickup <b>1049</b> of this embodiment may be modified in which the first light source <b>1001</b><i>a </i>and the second light source <b>1001</b><i>b </i>are reversed in the position with the optical detector <b>1018</b> like those in the optical pickup <b>1040</b> of Embodiment 3 which are opposite at the location to those in the optical pickup <b>1045</b> of Embodiment 5.

<p id="p-0434" num="0433">As described throughout Embodiments 3 to 8, the advancing path collimator lens <b>1004</b> and the returning path collimator lens <b>1014</b> of which the optical axes extend in parallel with each other are moved at once along their respective axes by the collimator lens actuator <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">However, the advancing path collimator lens <b>1004</b> and the returning path collimator lens <b>1014</b> are not necessarily set parallel to each other in the optical axis but may be arranged with their optical axes extending orthogonal to each other as equally covered by the present invention. In view of permitting no increase of the overall dimensions of the optical pickup, both the advancing path collimator lens <b>1004</b> and the returning path collimator lens <b>1014</b> of which the optical axes extend parallel to each other are preferably moved at once along their respective optical axes by the collimator lens actuator <b>1020</b> as described in Embodiments 3 to 8.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">Although the polarized light splitting surface <b>1006</b><i>a </i>of the polarizing beam splitter <b>1006</b> has the functions of splitting the optical path of the blue-violet laser beam emitted from the first light source <b>1001</b><i>a </i>into a path to the first objective lens <b>1010</b><i>a </i>and a path to the second objective lens <b>1010</b><i>b </i>and of combining the optical paths of the blue-violet laser beam reflected on the information recording surface of either the first information recording medium <b>50</b> or the second information recording medium <b>60</b>, its two functions for splitting and combining the optical paths may be provided separately.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0436"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> illustrates, for example, an optical pickup <b>1040</b>&#x2033; where a polarizing beam splitter <b>1006</b>&#x2033; has two different polarized light splitting surfaces <b>1006</b><i>a</i>, <b>1006</b><i>b </i>thereof. The polarized light splitting surface <b>1006</b><i>a </i>is arranged so as to pass almost entirely the polarized light A of the laser beam and reflect the polarized light B of the laser beam. The polarized light splitting surface <b>1006</b><i>b </i>is arranged so as to pass almost entirely the polarized light B of the laser beam and reflect the polarized light A of the laser beam.

<p id="p-0438" num="0437">As described in Embodiments 3 to 8 with the objective lenses provided for focusing the first optical disc <b>50</b>, the second optical disc <b>60</b>, the DVD <b>70</b>, and the CD <b>80</b> to perform the recording action or the playback action, the first objective lens <b>101</b><i>a </i>is used for recording or playing back the first optical disc <b>50</b> and the second objective lens <b>1010</b><i>b </i>is used for recording or playing back the second optical disc <b>60</b>, the DVD <b>70</b>, and the CD <b>80</b>.

<p id="p-0442" num="0441">A further embodiment of the present invention will be described in conjunction with the arrangement or its modification of any of Embodiments 1 to 8, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 64 to 68</figref>. Throughout <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 64 to 68</figref>, like functioning components are denoted by like numerals as those of the arrangement or its modification and will be explained in no more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442">It is essential for recording and playing back the optical disc to control the output of each light source at stableness particularly during the recording action. To control the output, a method (referred to as pre-detection of light) is proposed for monitoring the output from the light source through measuring the quantity of light with a light quantity detector which is disposed off the light path. More particularly, the light quantity of the laser beam emitted from the light source is calculated by measuring the quantity of light falling on the light quantity detector with the ratio of light quantity off the light path predetermined. The calculated light quantity is then fed back to a light quantity control circuit for controlling and stabilizing the output of the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">As the result, the quantity of the light beam released from the objective lens of the optical pickup and falling on the optical disc can be controlled at stableness. Another method may be provided for controlling the quantity of emitted light from the action of post detection of light at the light source, which is yet unfavorable for controlling the output at fair accuracy. It is nearly mandatory for a common updated optical recording/playback pickup to control the output of a light source through performing the pre-detection of light.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 64 to 68</figref> are some arrangements of this embodiment where the constructions of Embodiment 1 are accompanied with optical pre-detectors as the light quantity detector.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0445">The arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> includes a first optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>a </i>located at the rear side of a riser mirror <b>7</b><i>a</i>. With this arrangement, the laser beam <b>51</b> at the advancing path is passed through the riser mirror <b>7</b><i>a </i>at a constant rate along the direction of polarization of the incident light and received by the optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>a </i>for pre-detection. It is desired for ensuring the quantity of the laser beam departing from the objective lens <b>9</b> to set the ratio in the whole quantity of the laser beam <b>51</b> entering on the riser mirror <b>7</b><i>a </i>to the laser beam <b>51</b> passed through the riser mirror <b>7</b><i>a </i>to not higher than 10%. Also, since the laser beam <b>51</b> passed along the advancing path through the riser mirror <b>7</b><i>a </i>is to be focused on the light receiving area of the first optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>a </i>by a first pre-detection lens <b>15</b><i>a</i>, the laser beam <b>51</b> passed through the riser mirror <b>7</b><i>a </i>can be utilized without loss in this arrangement. A portion but not all of the laser beam <b>51</b> passed through the riser mirror <b>7</b><i>a </i>may be received directly by the light receiving area of the optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>a </i>with no use of the first optical pre-detection lens <b>15</b><i>a </i>for pre-detection with equal success.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0446">Similarly, a portion of the laser beam <b>61</b>, the red laser beam <b>71</b>, and the infrared laser beam <b>81</b> may be passed through the riser mirror <b>7</b><i>b </i>and received by a second optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>b </i>for pre-detection. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>, the laser beam <b>51</b> and laser beam <b>61</b> acting as the first laser beam, the red laser beam <b>71</b> acting as the second laser beam, and the infrared laser beam <b>81</b> acting as the third laser beam can be used for the optical pre-detection by using the first optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the second optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>b</i>. Also, combination of any of the laser beams <b>51</b>, <b>61</b>, <b>71</b>, and <b>81</b>, and the optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>may selectively be subjected to the pre-detection process.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0447">The arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref> includes an integrated optical pre-detector <b>16</b> arranged for detecting each of the laser beam <b>51</b>, the laser beam <b>61</b>, the red laser beam <b>71</b>, and the infrared laser beam <b>81</b>. More particularly, a portion of each of the laser beams falling at the advancing path on the optical surface <b>4</b><i>b </i>of a second prism <b>42</b> is either passed through or reflected by the optical surface <b>4</b><i>b</i>, and then received by the integrated optical pre-detector <b>16</b>. This allows all or any combination of the laser beam <b>51</b>, the laser beam <b>61</b>, the red laser beam <b>71</b>, and the infrared laser beam <b>81</b> to be subjected to the optical pre-detection process with the integrated optical pre-detector <b>16</b>, hence reducing the total number of the components and the overall dimensions of the optical pickup.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0448">For subjecting the laser beam <b>51</b> to the optical pre-detection process, the optical surface <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the first prism <b>41</b> may preferably be arranged to reflect the laser beam <b>51</b> at a specific rate. The arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref> like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> may be implemented with either the use or not of the pre-detection lens <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0449">The arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref> is differed from the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> with the employment of the first optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the second optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>b</i>. In the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>, the optical pre-detection of the laser beam <b>51</b> is performed by the first optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>a </i>which is located to receive a portion of the laser beam <b>51</b> passed through a riser mirror <b>7</b><i>a </i>while the optical pre-detection of any or a combination of the laser beam <b>61</b>, the red laser beam <b>71</b>, and the infrared laser beam <b>81</b> is performed by the second optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>b </i>which is located to receive the light reflected by or passed through the optical surface <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the second prism <b>42</b>. This will be implemented with equal advantage.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0450">The arrangements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 67 and 68</figref> are also equally advantageous in which with a pair of bending mirrors <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>14</b><i>c </i>provided for bending the optical path of, for example, the laser beam <b>51</b>, the first optical pre-detector <b>16</b><i>a </i>is located to receive a portion of the laser beam <b>51</b> which has passed through either the bending mirror <b>14</b><i>b </i>or the bending mirror <b>14</b><i>c </i>after entering at the advancing path the bending mirror <b>14</b><i>b </i>or the bending mirror <b>14</b><i>c. </i></p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application relates to sliceable routers and their transmission interfaces.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The Internet has become ossified due to its strong support of numerous activities of our society and the fact that it was not defined with the current vision of a business and societal infrastructure. For example, despite international support and strong technical motivation to migrate, IPv6 has not been widely deployed yet. The reason is that the basic concept of the Internet as an end-to-end packet delivery service has made its middle layer, networking services through TCP/IP, untouchable. To test any disruptive enhancements to security, routing flexibility and reliability, and robust quality of service guarantees in coming years, an Internet environment is needed where networking environments offering differing strengths can coexist on a permanent basis.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Global Environment for Networking Innovation (GENI) is a US national shared experimental facility for future Internet research. One application-specific agile virtual network (namely slice) enables user defined experiment to run on GENI. In each slice, the virtual topology consisted of multiple virtual links (in contrast to physical links in GENI). Each virtual link not only provides connectivity (in addition to delay or packet loss ratio or even protection constraints), but also requires guaranteed bandwidth (arbitrary bandwidth granularity) for highly fidelity experiments. Due to multiple experiments running on one physical GENI substrate simultaneously, all resources including router bandwidth, processing computing cycles, and storage capacity should be sliceable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In GENI, the routers play key roles for bandwidth virtualization, forwarding user packets, and computing routes. Thus, the problem of router bandwidth (or interface) virtualization for providing various kinds of virtual links is becoming a basic problem in GENI. The requirement of virtual link should be programmable, reconfigurable, and bandwidth guaranteed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional router usually provides several types of transmission pipe, e.g., Packets over SONET/SDH (POS), Gigabit Ethernet or 10 Gigabit Ethernet (GE/10GE) optical interfaces, which are mainly based on TDM/TDMA. Currently, there are already several applied methods for providing virtual interfaces or virtual links in GENI, most of them are based on software tunnels (only providing connectivity, no bandwidth guaranteed), including:

<p id="p-0018" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a router (called sliceable router) structure utilizing optical OFDMA-based programmable mechanisms for bandwidth management. The router provides bandwidth virtualization for routers by adopting a new optical transmission interface, i.e., packet over optical OFDMA transmission interface that is not only a modulation format, but also a multiplexing technique, dividing the transmission bandwidth into N (e.g., 256) parallel sub-channels. Each optical OFDMA physical link (e.g., data rate 10 Gb/s) supports parallel multiple virtual links (bandwidth programmable). Each virtual interface of router with different IP address/mask works just like one physical transmission pipe such as OC-192c packet over SONET and Gigabit Ethernet (POS/GE). A forwarding engine (FE) of router is integrated with optical OFDMA transmission to provide a transmission-aware FE. The optical OFDMA interface of router transmits the packets through a number of orthogonal sub-carriers, each carrying a relatively low data rate, so that the data period could be enlarged and the optical multi-path interference (i.e., CD/PMD) is reduced. It is a special case of multi-carrier transmission interface whereas conventional routers usually use statistics-based TDM/TDMA transmission interfaces (e.g., POS/GE interfaces).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a sliceable router structure utilizing optical OFDMA interface. To avoid redundancy, only one transmission path is shown, and the other direction is simply the reverse of the transmission path. The sliceable router has main four parts. In one part, a virtual interface includes a virtual link block <b>12</b> with M queues that receive data from a forwarding engine <b>13</b>. The forwarding engine <b>13</b> receives incoming data packets. The outputs of the virtual link queues <b>12</b> are provided to N sub-carrier queue block <b>11</b> which in turn are provided to a digital signal processing block <b>10</b> for handling optical OFDM functions. The virtual interface represents the optical OFDMA interfaces that support multiple virtual links (VL) in one physical links, each VL is just like conventional GE or POS router interfaces in blocks <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>. The FE <b>13</b> can send data to the GE interface queue which is provided to a scheduler block <b>18</b> and then sent to the transceiver (e.g., GBIC) unit. Alternatively, the FE <b>13</b> can send data to the POS interface queue <b>17</b>, which sends the data to the scheduler block <b>18</b> and then to the transceiver (e.g., SFP) block <b>19</b>. The FE <b>13</b> can also send data to control packet queues <b>14</b> for each slice. The queues <b>14</b> sends data over a backplane bus <b>15</b> to a routing engine <b>16</b>. Blocks <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are responsible for each slice routing protocols and forwarding information database (FIB) computing, the basic functionality of the routing engine (RE) <b>16</b> is similar with those conventional routers except that the RE needs to take the virtual interfaces of the virtual link queue <b>12</b> into account. In one embodiment, the FE <b>13</b> is based on the principle of longest-prefix match (LPM), which treats conventional interfaces of blocks <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>, itself interface (routing protocols) of block <b>14</b>, and multiple virtual interfaces of block <b>12</b> in one physical optical OFDMA port in a consistent way.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0026">In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each OFDMA link/port carries multiple virtual links (e.g., M channels of subset of sub-carriers). The FE <b>13</b> maintains separate FIFO for each virtual link to store the packets, which maybe IP packets or not. The FIB keeps each entry for each virtual interface. The FE <b>13</b> is integrated with the optical OFDMA transmission, i.e., transmission-aware FE.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0027">The packet over optical OFDMA interfaces is a high-speed router transmission technique (when compared with PoS/GE router interfaces). One sub-carrier is similar with one time slot, but it is more flexible than the time slot. For example, in optical OFDMA interface, different sub-carriers can adaptively change their modulation/coding format to deal with physical layer impairments, thus each subset of sub-carrier supports different data rates (vs. the same rate for all time slots due to the need for fast clock recovery).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0028">The optical OFDMA interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is different from conventional PoS/GE/10GE packet interfaces in a router, which has different link data frame format, PHY frame format, waveform/modulation format for transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0029">The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides flexibility due to protocol independence and service transparency: in essence, subsets of sub-carriers, like transparent pipes, are ideal for bandwidth resource sharing and isolation (virtualization), which can emulate any kind of virtual links at any granularity, the forwarded packets could be arbitrary format. The system provides a 100% bandwidth guarantee: when compared to statistics, or queuing based approaches including the most popular IP/MPLS/Ethernet tunnel connections, using the optical OFDMA can provide 100% bandwidth guarantee and 100% isolation among different slices, and potentially more flexible bandwidth allocations.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0030">In one embodiment, the system achieves low cost and high performance due to cross-layer design in router/optics by taking advantages of FPGA-based digital signal processing (DSP). The system integrates the optical transmission with routing/forwarding functionalities in one layer, and natively supports parallel services without rigid clock and synchronization issues. It is the ideal solution for the overlay experimental networks when comparing with the traditional IP router with rigid TDM transmission solution.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0031">As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a 6-node sliceable router with networks <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>26</b>. The slice or virtual network with nodes <b>20</b>, <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> is a user experimental network. Each optical OFDMA physical link supports parallel multiple bandwidth programmable virtual links <b>29</b>. Each virtual interface with different IP address works as one physical transmission pipe. The router of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> provides a guaranteed bandwidth for each virtual link, and can be changed in real-time manner through signaling or routing protocols. The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also provides a reconfigurable virtual link (bandwidth and topology reconfiguration-on-demand in real-time manner).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0032">The virtual interface and virtual link shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are different from the solutions provided by conventional IP/MPLS hardware router or software router, i.e., the Labeled Switched Path (LSP)/Tunnel solutions for virtual link in conventional routers. The conventional tunnel or LSP with higher overhead could not guarantee the bandwidth for virtual link even though those complicated WRR or WFQ scheduling algorithms deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> presents an exemplary embodiment of the packet over optical OFDM interface transmitter exemplified by blocks <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an exemplary receiver structure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a plurality of M virtual interfaces <b>31</b> receive incoming data packets and provide the data to a virtual link controller <b>32</b>. The virtual interfaces <b>31</b> can be a FIFO buffer, for example. A plurality of encoders <b>33</b> such as Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoders are connected to the virtual link controller <b>32</b>. Each encoder <b>33</b> drives a sub-carrier mapping unit <b>34</b> such as a quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (mQAM) sub-carrier mapping circuit. The output of the sub-carrier mapping unit <b>34</b> is provided to a time to frequency domain converter <b>35</b> coupled to the sub-carrier mapping unit which is an Inverse discrete Fourier transform (IFFT) in one embodiment. Next, the data is provided to a cyclic prefix unit <b>36</b> from the time to frequency domain converter <b>35</b> to provide symbol gap. The output is then provided to an optical transmitter coupled to the cyclic prefix unit. The optical transmitter includes a parallel to serial converter <b>37</b> to convert parallel data into serial data; a digital to analog converter (DAC) <b>38</b> connected to the parallel to serial converter; and an optical modulator <b>39</b>. The resulting data packet is provide to an optical OFDMA link <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an exemplary OFDMA receiver that works with the transmitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The receiver includes an optical receiver to receive data packets from an optical OFDMA link <b>401</b>. The packets are provided to a frequency to time domain converter <b>46</b> such as an FFT unit. A sub-carrier mapping unit <b>45</b> receives the output of the frequency to time domain converter <b>46</b> to provide synchronization and alignment of the data. A plurality of QPSK demodulators <b>44</b> are connected to the sub-carrier mapping unit <b>45</b>, each demodulator <b>44</b> in turn is connected to an FEC decoder <b>43</b>. The outputs of the decoders <b>43</b> are provided to a virtual link controller <b>42</b>. Virtual interfaces <b>41</b> receive the output from the virtual link controller <b>42</b>. The optical receiver in turn includes a receiver <b>49</b> that is connected to the OFDM link <b>401</b>. An analog to digital converter <b>48</b> is connected to the receiver; and a serial to parallel converter <b>47</b> converts serial data into parallel data for use by the FFT unit.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0035">Viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> together, in one implementation, a plurality of packets are forwarded from/to FIFO buffer <b>31</b> or <b>41</b> by the FE <b>13</b>. The packets are received by the virtual link level controller <b>32</b> or <b>42</b>, which are responsible for virtual link diagnosis (e.g., up/down) and packets encapsulation. The systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> then apply a line coding scheme through FEC encoder/decoder <b>33</b> or <b>43</b>, each of which improves the bit error ratio performance for each virtual link. The packet over OFDM transmission may support M virtual interfaces (VIF), each VIF is isolated by a dedicated subset of sub-carriers (w/different kinds of modulation/code format, e.g., QPSK/QAM <b>34</b> or <b>44</b>. The sub-carrier mapping/demapping unit <b>34</b> or <b>44</b> is responsible for the mapping/demapping of sub-carriers/virtual interface. An IFFT/FFT (N sub-carrier) unit <b>35</b> or <b>46</b> is responsible converting the symbol from time domain/frequency domain to frequency domain/time domain. Next, a cyclic prefix (CP) module <b>36</b> is added after IFFT operation for handling symbol gaps. A sub-carrier correlator <b>45</b> is used for channel synchronization and alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0036">The optical OFDMA transmitter and receiver of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref> are different from conventional GE and POS transmitter/receivers that are mainly based on TDM/TDMA. POS/GE transmitter/receiver does not support virtual interfaces in the link level.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is the link level data frame structure of packet over optical OFDMA transmission interface. In this embodiment, the virtual link controller <b>32</b> or <b>42</b> is responsible for encapsulating multiple packets in one data frame as well as link maintenance. The fields <b>51</b> include fields showing a delimiter (0x7E), a type indicator (what kind of packets), and the number of packets <b>52</b> encapsulated in the frame and the content field <b>53</b>. The data frame ends with a delimiter field <b>54</b>. The data frame structure is lower overhead, simple and straightforward. The packet format includes two fields: packet header <b>52</b> and content <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0038">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows one format, the packet format could be arbitrary and not limited to current IP packet format.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows one exemplary mapping structure of virtual interfaces to sub-carriers for packet over optical OFDMA transmission interface. The adaptive mapping scheme for the virtual interface to transparent subset of sub-carriers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is different from conventional address resolution protocol (ARP) (e.g., GE interface) or fixed mapped structure in a PPP pipe (e.g., POS interface). In this structure, each entry is maintained locally by the sliceable router. A virtual interface (VIF) index <b>61</b> identifies the virtual interface ID and the associated FIFO ID. Each virtual interface is configured as an IP address (<b>62</b>) with a mask (<b>63</b>). In one embodiment, they are each 4 bytes long. A bit map structure <b>64</b> is used for the mapping of sub-carrier to virtual interfaces. In one implementation, a bit map of 0 means this sub-carrier is not used for this virtual interface, while a bit map value of 1 means that the sub-carrier is used for this virtual interface. The number of sub-carriers N is configured in advance. A flag <b>65</b> is provided for future use or other policies configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows another view of the optical OFDMA virtual interface system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the FE <b>13</b> receives data from conventional packet interfaces such as POS/GE interfaces in blocks <b>17</b>-<b>19</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The FE <b>13</b> can forward packets over the routing engine formed with blocks <b>14</b>-<b>16</b>. The FE <b>13</b> also receives data from virtual interfaces delivered as packets over the optical OFDMA interfaces through blocks <b>10</b>-<b>12</b>. The optical OFDMA interfaces in turn receives and transmits data over queues such as incoming FIFOs <b>31</b> and outgoing FIFOs <b>41</b>. The virtual link controllers <b>32</b> and <b>42</b> handle the virtual link data frame with fields <b>51</b>-<b>54</b>. The sub-carrier mapping unit <b>34</b> and demapping unit <b>44</b> adaptively maps data between virtual interfaces and sub-carrier signals.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0041">The resulting packet over optical OFDMA transmission provides a high-speed multi-carrier transmission technique where data bits are encoded to multiple sub-carriers and sent simultaneously in time, which result in an optimum usage of router transmission bandwidth. Compared against conventional IP/MPLS hardware router or software router, the sliceable router architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> utilizes optical OFDMA transmission technique and provides a method in the link level to support virtual interfaces via transparent subset of sub-carriers and adaptive mapping scheme. Compared to Label switching path (LSP)/Tunnel solutions for providing virtual links in conventional routers, the transceiver structure and mapping schemes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> guarantee flexible/programmable bandwidth management/sharing schemes for different slices, it also has lower overhead as well as higher spectral efficiency for transmission. In additional to the slice provisioning, the virtualization method is also ideal for broadband multimedia applications such as HDTV transmission, HD Video, IPTV applications, RoF applications, and mobile backhaul applications, among others.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Cross-reference is made to the following co-pending application, which is also hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety:</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/034,131 (Publ. No. 20050123194 A1) for &#x201c;METHOD OF EMBEDDING COLOR INFORMATION IN PRINTED DOCUMENTS USING WATERMARKING,&#x201d; by Z. Fan et al., filed Jan. 12, 2005, a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/082,535, filed Feb. 21, 2002.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Disclosed is a system and method for determining preferred image locations for placing watermark information for both hidden and obvious marks, and more particularly the use of at least one of three criteria (image similarity, contrast, and image value range) to determine the best area of hiding or showing the watermark, depending upon the user's intent for the mark.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known to use digital watermarks, and to obtain such marks by embedding a digital string into an image. The digital watermarks can be created either in a spatial domain or in a transform domain. In transform domain digital watermarking, the digital string is embedded using a transformation space, such as Fourier transform or the like, to obtain a spread spectrum characteristic of noise insensitivity. Correspondingly, the digital watermark is not an image and can not be simply reconstructed or verified optically, though the actually encoded digital watermark data can be arbitrary, thus also an image in some other transform domain. An example of spatial domain digital watermarking is found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,252,971 to S. Wang, for &#x201c;DIGITAL WATERMARKING USING PHASE-SHIFTED STOCLUSTIC SCREENS,&#x201d; issued Jun. 26, 2001, where the watermark can be reconstructed as image directly in the space domain.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Classical watermarks are image-wise watermarks, meaning that they can be viewed by a user, normally to verify authenticity, but often only to establish a perception of value or beauty. Image-wise digital watermarks exist in the form of glossmarks, correlation marks and embedded image watermarks as described, for example in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/034,131 (above), as well as U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/876,001 (U.S. Publ. 20050128524 A1), for &#x201c;ENHANCEMENT OF GLOSSMARK IMAGES AT LOW AND HIGH DENSITIES,&#x201d; by Liu et al., filed Jun. 24, 2004, also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The advantage of such watermarks is that they more closely resemble classical watermarks, albeit with the added capability of variable content. This variable content, however, also directly interacts with the background image and a truly automated use of variable watermarks requires the correct positioning (or identification of the watermark location) based on the watermark content and the image content. In other words, when an image-wise watermark is to be employed, and it is desirable to either make the mark visible or to hide the mark, the &#x201c;best&#x201d; or preferred position at which such a mark should be reproduced in the image is strongly dependent upon the nature of the mark as well as the image&#x2014;where simply repositioning the mark within an image may significantly alter the detectability (desired/undesired) of a mark.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,956,958, by Z. Fan et al. &#x201c;METHOD OF EMBEDDING COLOR INFORMATION IN PRINTED DOCUMENTS USING WATERMARKING&#x201d;, issued Oct. 18, 2005, describes a method of enhancing color fidelity in multi-reproduction that includes an encoding part, which usually resides in a printer (or the printing part of a copier, but may also be resident in software stored in a computer) and a decoding part which usually resides in a scanner (or the scanning part of a copier, but may also be resident in software stored in a computer) so as to add color fidelity information directly to the output print. Each part can be divided into layers where the top layers are responsible for management of color information while the bottom layers are responsible for embedding/detection of digital watermarks containing the color information.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the present disclosure is directed to a system and a method for determining preferred image locations for placing watermark information for both hidden and obvious marks. Preferred locations provide either a high degree of hiding or visibility depending on the goal. At least three metrics may be employed in making a determination of a preferred position of a watermark, including (i) image value, (ii) image/watermark value similarity, and (iii) image/watermark contrast similarity.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the case of image-wise watermarking, two possible applications/intentions can be considered as the extreme cases, and all intermediate cases can be derived from two end points established by the extreme cases. In the first case, the watermark is intended to be as unobtrusive as possible, and in the second case, the watermark is intended to be clearly visible. An example of the first scenario is where the image-wise watermark is intended to be completely hidden. An example of the second scenario is a variable data glossmark storing, for example a serial number, on a photo.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The &#x201c;best&#x201d; area for embedding a watermark can generally be found following a combination of one or more of three criteria: (i) image/watermark value similarity; (ii) image/watermark contrast similarity; and (iii) image value range. As will be appreciated based upon the following discussion, the use of the criteria may be independent of one another, or two or more criteria may be combined using a weighted average or similar approach so as to optimize the placement of the watermark in order to achieve a desired objective of the watermark (e.g., maximize or minimize visibility).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally speaking, with respect to the image/watermark value similarity criteria, if the target image and the watermark image information are similar, the watermark will be more subtle or less detectable. On the other hand, if they are dissimilar, the watermark will be more obvious or apparent. As for the image/watermark contrast similarity, if the contrast of the target image is high, watermark contrast will be lost, and vice versa. Lastly, for the image value range criteria, since all watermarks are created by modulating the input image, sufficient image data must be present locally to serve as an information carrier (to carry the overlaid watermark image).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Having described the general considerations used to select locations for a watermark to be overlaid on a target image, attention is now directed to a more detailed discussion relative to each of the possible criteria used to determine a location. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment the image value similarity criteria computes a gray-level based variance (if the absolute brightness of the watermark is not fixed, the calculation can be done bias independent). In order to do this, the input or target image <b>110</b> is first received or retrieved from a storage medium or memory <b>114</b> as indicated by operation <b>120</b>. An example of a target image is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> Next, the target image is divided into or reduced to a small set of image areas <b>124</b>, for example about 20&#xd7;20 areas, as represented by operation <b>128</b>. In the analysis phase of operation <b>128</b>, the average gray level of the target image areas is computed and stored as target data <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a similar manner, the watermark image <b>140</b>, having been received and/or stored in memory, operation <b>144</b>, is also reduced in size to a substantially smaller number of areas, say 4&#xd7;4, as depicted at <b>154</b>. The divided watermark image is characterized as indicated by reference numeral <b>150</b>, and the associated characteristic metric data indicated as <b>158</b>. An example of a watermark image is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref></p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Processing of the images in this manner can be justified by the application, where the watermark only covers a certain area of the image, or is replicated at several points in a target image, with one of the replications being in an optimized spot, or by identifying important and not so important areas of the watermark. In general, it can be said that if a position can be chosen, it also means that the watermark must be smaller than the target image; otherwise, no choice would be available. Moreover, while the disclosed embodiment is directed to particular images and relative number of areas or sections it should be recognized that these are illustrative examples, and that the systems and methods described relative to the examples have broad application and are not necessarily limited by the example images or the exemplary analysis details set forth.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example target image and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the corresponding area entries indicating the average intensity values for each of the 20&#xd7;20 image areas. The array <b>132</b> of average intensity data depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an example of the data that is described above as being derived from the target image. It should be noted that the number of areas (e.g., 20&#xd7;20) is chosen somewhat arbitrarily and that equivalent calculations can also be performed on various array sizes. It is also the case that equivalent calculations can be performed for color images and color image data by, for example, looking at the luminance for scalar data or by looking at the color for vector computations.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to embed or overlay the watermark image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is necessary to compute the corresponding image areas of the watermark image as illustrated in the array of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. After calculating the variance values between the target image and the watermark, the resulting variance being depicted in array <b>610</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is then possible to analyze or sort the variances, rendering&#x2014;in this case&#x2014;the five highlighted entries (<b>620</b>) in the array of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> as the lowest variance areas, and thus the optimized locations for embedding of the watermark.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, using only the similarity criteria for example, the method of determining an optimal location of the watermark is completed by the comparison described above relative to the examples, where the resultant array of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (divided image areas <b>620</b>) are identified at operation <b>170</b>, and the watermark is then overlaid or embedded into the target image at those locations, producing the watermarked digital image <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A similar processing can be performed for the contrast criteria at operations <b>128</b> and <b>170</b> if <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A second embodiment of the method is to use an automatic image enhancement (AIE) based contrast calculation. Such a characteristic metric may be established by following the method outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 5,450,502 for a &#x201c;IMAGE DEPENDENT LUMINANCE ENHANCEMENT,&#x201d; by R. Eschbach et al. issued Sep. 12, 1995, and hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. For certain kinds of watermarks, it can be assumed that the watermark is best located in image regions of low contrast. This can be done by separating the image into a number of regions. For simplicity, assume non-overlapping regions, though overlapping and multi-scale regions are understood variations of the described approach. Assuming 10&#xd7;10 areas as used for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is possible to compute the local contrast, preferably using the histogram variance method outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 5,450,502. In the histogram variance method, N histograms are derived&#x2014;in the example 10&#xd7;10=100 histograms&#x2014;that are then sorted according to variance of the histogram, with a high variance indicating a low contrast and vice versa. One can now use a fixed threshold to find areas of a pre-specified low contrast attribute, or one can alternatively find the M areas with the lowest contrast (largest variance value).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a target image and the array <b>810</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> gives the corresponding overlay areas for 10&#xd7;10 areas of the target image, assuming a fixed threshold in the contrast variance metric. In the disclosed example, it is assumed that the &#x201c;best&#x201d; overlay areas are those with the least image contrast (indicated by an &#x201c;X&#x201d; in array <b>810</b>), since the image contrast will act as localized noise with respect to the watermark. It will, however, be appreciated that this applies in the case where it is desirable to view the watermark&#x2014;for example a visible watermark overlay using a glossmark. In the opposite case, where desirable to hide the watermark, it may be preferable to place the watermark in areas having greater image contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Yet a third embodiment for the method by which an optimal watermark location is determined involves the image value range characteristic as noted above. In this embodiment, perhaps the simplest, area selection is based on the input image value range. The basis for this characteristic is the assumption that any coding or modulation of the image data to embed a watermark in the target image data requires that the target image act as an information carrier. Hence, the data of the target image must provide sufficient image data in a local area to serve as the information carrier for the watermark. The image value range is simply defined based on the watermark criteria, and in general will limit the useful area to exclude the extreme ends of the image. In other words, areas of the target image that would be most suitable for coding a watermark are mid-tone areas, whereas the totally white areas or fully saturated color areas would be the least suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The following example illustrates the importance of the system and methods disclosed herein to automatically identify preferred or &#x201c;best&#x201d; watermark locations in a target digital image. Consider the scenario, in which a unique ID number is to be placed visibly over an image. In order to understand this example the reader is referred to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, where there is depicted an identification card <b>810</b> having a person's photograph in region <b>820</b> overlaid with a repeating ID number <b>830</b>. Although for purposes of illustration the ID number was simply placed over the image, in actual applications the watermark (ID number) would typically be much less visible. In the example, the ID number <b>830</b> is repeated over the image <b>820</b>. On careful examination, one sees that the digits in several regions (e.g., upper right region <b>850</b>) are virtually invisible in the image, despite the extreme nature of this type of embedding. When using any form of watermark, the general watermark contrast will be reduced and the numbers will be much less visible in order to not to destroy the image for identification purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Knowledge of the watermark size, as well as knowledge of the optimized watermark areas would allow an automated system to assure that the complete ID is readable, even though parts of the ID are obscured in every instance of the ID number string (e.g.: the first portion of the ID is visible in one region of the image, a second portion in another region, and a last portion in yet a further region). This will encapsulate sufficient overlap to uniquely read the entire ID number even though there might not be a single area in the target image sufficiently large to hold the entire watermarked ID number.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As briefly mentioned above, the three criteria described in detail above may be employed, alone or in combination with one another (or other criteria) to determine a preferred location within an image to apply a watermark. Use of the system and method described above also requires that an instruction or requirement be established to indicate whether the process is to optimize visibility or &#x201c;invisibility&#x201d; of the watermark (i.e. overlaying in dissimilar or similar image areas). Next, a determination must be made as to which of the criteria will be employed to make the location determination. If more than one criterion is employed, the weighting of each criterion should also be established in relation to the particular intent of the watermark. Such weighting or other parameters (e.g., thresholds for contrast, variance, etc.) are then employed during the processing of the target image and/or the watermark image. Both, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are processed to produce a &#x201c;low resolution map&#x201d; of the image, such as the 20&#xd7;20 and 4&#xd7;4 arrays for the target (<b>132</b>) and watermark (<b>158</b>) images respectively. Subsequently, the analysis of the images proceeds in accordance with the selected criteria ((i) image/watermark value similarity, (ii) image/watermark contrast similarity; and (iii) image value range), and the result is likely an array <b>610</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, where the processed data is retained as a &#x201c;map.&#x201d; The areas of the map can then be sorted (based upon the pre-defined preferences (e.g., ascending or descending order), and the first N areas will then be identified as the preferred locations into which the watermark is embedded.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As a further example, consider the situation where a glossmark is to be embedded into a target image so that upon printing of the target with the glossmark, the mark will be visually unobtrusive, but nonetheless detectable. In such a situation, the image value range criteria is of particular import because areas with too much or too little toner are undesirable for the embedding of glossmarks. Hence, the image value range criteria would be used to rule out certain areas of the target image. Next, the contrast similarity criteria would be applied, but in this case to the target image only; assuming that even low contrast portions of the glossmark should be visible results in a &#x201c;constant&#x201d; contrast map for the glossmark image. The result of the contrast similarity criteria would then be employed to select areas with minimal variance as preferred locations for embedding the mark.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In yet a further application of the methods described herein, the areas identified for embedding the mark may be further employed to control the size of the watermark to be applied. For example, if a plurality of adjacent areas are suitable (e.g., above a contrast variance threshold), then it may also be possible to agglomerate the areas so as to provide a larger region (consisting of adjacent analysis areas) in which the watermark may be embedded. In other words, the size (magnification) of the watermark may be increased to cover more than a single area.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The disclosed system and method further find application in the production of variable or on-demand documents as depicted for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, particularly when such documents need to be rendered with an image-wise watermark. Recognizing that in variable print output (variable input target images <b>1010</b>), the target image may vary with each printed document. In such a situation, the previously described process may be applied on a document-by-document basis in order to assure that the resulting output documents <b>1074</b> each have a watermark displayed in a preferred location of the output document&#x2014;regardless of the fact that the content of the document may change from one document to the next. It will be appreciated that the system and methods described above emulate, to some level, what experienced graphic designers might do in selecting the location(s) for watermarks&#x2014;thereby adding &#x201c;intelligence&#x201d; as opposed to simply applying a watermark redundantly over entire image.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Those knowledgeable with variable data printing system will recognize that the schematic illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> identifies several components and nodes of know production printing environments. The various operations described herein may, therefore, be performed on a digital front end (DFE) device <b>1080</b> or other pre-press processors that are suitable for receiving image data, including watermark images and variable input data, storing the data I a memory and then processing the data to produce a stream of information that may be employed to drive a printing system (printer <b>1090</b>) such as a digital xerographic printer&#x2014;whether black/white, highlight color or full color. The output of such printers may, therefore, incorporate variable print information as well as optimally placed image-wise watermarks, without the requirement of user intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be appreciated that various of the above-disclosed and other features and functions, or alternatives thereof, may be desirably combined into many other different systems or applications. Also that various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives, modifications, variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art which are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to imaging of an object, and more specifically to visualizing an image that is registered with a pre-acquired volume image data set.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Image registration finds wide application in medical imaging, video motion analysis, remote sensing, security and surveillance applications. Further, the process of finding the correspondence between the contents of the images is generally referred to as image registration. In other words, image registration typically entails finding a geometric transform that non-ambiguously links locations and orientations of the same objects or parts thereof in the different images. More particularly, image registration includes transforming the different sets of image data to a common coordinate space. The images may be obtained by different imaging devices or alternatively by the same imaging device but at different imaging sessions or time frames. As will be appreciated, in the field of medical imaging, there has been a steady increase in the number of imaging sessions or scans a patient undergoes. Images of a body part may be obtained temporally from the same imaging modality or system. Alternatively, in multi-modal imaging, images of the same body parts may be captured via use of different imaging modalities such as an X-ray imaging system, a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging system, a computed tomography (CT) imaging system, an ultrasound imaging system or a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In medical applications, registration of images is confronted by the challenges associated with patient movement. For example, due to either conscious or unconscious movement of the patient between two scans obtained either via the same imaging modality or otherwise, there exists an unpredictable change between the two scans. Unfortunately, this change in position leads to misalignment of the images. Additionally, patient position may vary depending on the imaging modalities used for multi-modal scanning. For example, a patient is generally positioned in the prone position (i.e., lying face down) for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning session and may be in the supine position (i.e., lying face up) during a colon exam scanning session thereby creating inherent registration problems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Volume-guided ultrasound is an application in which an ultrasound image may be registered to a previously acquired (pre-acquired) image volume. The pre-acquired volume data set may include a CT image data set, an MR image data set, a PET image data set, or an ultrasound image data set, for example. As will be appreciated, it may be desirable to simultaneously display the ultrasound image data and the corresponding slices or rendering from the pre-acquired volume image data set.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Previously conceived solutions to display the ultrasound image and the corresponding slices or rendering from the pre-acquired volume image data set include displaying the ultrasound image and a corresponding slice in a side-by-side configuration on a display of an imaging system. However, if the two images are displayed side-by-side then the screen size may limit the size of the displayed images. Alternatively, if the side-by-side display of the two images includes a larger display of the images, then partial clipping of the images may be required in order to accommodate the two images within a limited size of the display. Further, the pre-acquired image volume data set may include a substantially large volume of information. Consequently, if the two images are displayed in their entirety and in the same scale, then the displayed images are relatively small. Alternatively, the pre-acquired image volume image may be clipped off, however, the context of the currently displayed slice may not be easily understood.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is therefore a need for a design of a method and system capable of efficiently visualizing a registered ultrasound image and a corresponding pre-acquired image volume data set in a side-by-side configuration. Further, there is also a need for a design of a method and system capable of visualizing an ultrasound image and a pre-acquired image volume data set that are overlaid on one another. In particular, there is a significant need for a design of a method and a system for visualizing registered images that enhances clinical workflow and facilitates superior diagnosis.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As will be described in detail hereinafter, an imaging system capable of superior visualization of a registered image, and methods of visualizing registered images are presented. Although, the exemplary embodiments illustrated hereinafter are described in the context of a medical imaging system, it will be appreciated that use of the imaging system capable of visualizing registered images in industrial applications are also contemplated in conjunction with the present technique. The industrial applications may include applications, such as, but not limited to, baggage scanning applications, and other security and surveillance applications.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary system <b>10</b> for use in imaging, in accordance with aspects of the present technique. More particularly, the system <b>10</b> may be configured to facilitate visualization of a registered image and a corresponding pre-acquired image volume. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the figures are for illustrative purposes and are not drawn to scale. The system <b>10</b> may be configured to facilitate acquisition of image data from a patient (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) via a plurality of image acquisition systems. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the imaging system <b>10</b> is illustrated as including a first image acquisition system <b>12</b>, a second image acquisition system <b>14</b> and an N<sup>th </sup>image acquisition system <b>16</b>. It may be noted that the first image acquisition system <b>12</b> may be configured to obtain a first image data set representative of the patient under observation. In a similar fashion, the second image acquisition system <b>14</b> may be configured to facilitate acquisition of a second image data set associated with the same patient, while the N<sup>th </sup>image acquisition system <b>16</b> may be configured to facilitate acquisition of an N<sup>th </sup>image data set from the same patient.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with one aspect of the present technique, the diagnostic system <b>10</b> is representative of a multi-modality imaging system. In other words, a variety of image acquisition systems may be employed to obtain image data representative of the same patient. More particularly, in certain embodiments each of the first image acquisition system <b>12</b>, the second image acquisition system <b>14</b> and the N<sup>th </sup>image acquisition system <b>16</b> may include a CT imaging system, a PET imaging system, an ultrasound imaging system, an X-ray imaging system, a MR imaging system, an optical imaging system or a combination thereof. For example, in one embodiment, the first image acquisition system <b>12</b> may include a CT imaging system, while the second image acquisition system <b>14</b> may include an ultrasound imaging system and the N<sup>th </sup>image acquisition system <b>16</b> may include a PET imaging system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, in certain other embodiments, the imaging system <b>10</b> may include one image acquisition system, such as the first image acquisition system <b>12</b>. In other words, the imaging system <b>10</b> may include a single modality imaging system. For example, the imaging system <b>10</b> may include only one image acquisition system <b>12</b>, such as an ultrasound imaging system. In this embodiment, a plurality of images, such as a plurality of scans taken over a period of time, of the same patient may be obtained by the same image acquisition system <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The plurality of image data sets representative of the patient that has been obtained either by a single modality imaging system or by different image acquisition modalities may then be merged to obtain a combined image. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, imaging modalities such as PET imaging systems and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging systems may be employed to obtain functional body images which provide physiological information, while imaging modalities such as CT imaging systems and MR imaging systems may be used to acquire structural images of the body that may serve as anatomic maps of the body. These different imaging techniques are known to provide image data sets with complementary and occasionally conflicting information regarding the body. It may be desirable to reliably coalesce these image data sets to facilitate generation of a composite, overlapping image that may include additional clinical information which may not be apparent in each of the individual image data sets. More particularly, the composite image facilitates clinicians to obtain information regarding shape, size and spatial relationship between anatomical structures and any pathology, if present.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Moreover, the plurality of image data sets obtained via a single imaging modality system may also be combined to generate a composite image. This composite image may aid clinicians in conducting follow-up studies in the patient or in a comparison of an image with normal uptake properties to an image with suspected abnormalities.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The plurality of acquired image data sets may be &#x201c;registered&#x201d; so that the image information associated with a region may be viewed from each image data set. These images may then be used to generate a composite display. Image registration techniques may be utilized to coalesce the plurality of image data sets obtained by the imaging system <b>10</b> via a processing module <b>18</b>, in certain embodiments. In a presently contemplated configuration, the processing module <b>18</b> may include a registration platform <b>20</b>, where the registration platform <b>20</b> may be configured to aid in the volume based registration of two or more image data sets. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the processing module <b>18</b> is operatively coupled to the image acquisition systems <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. As previously noted, image registration may be defined as a process of transforming the different image data sets into one common coordinate system. More particularly, the process of image registration involves finding one or more suitable transformations that may be employed to transform the image data sets under study to a common coordinate system. The transforms may include transforms, such as, but not limited to, rigid transforms, non-rigid transforms, or affine transforms. The rigid transforms may include, for example, translations, rotations or combinations thereof. Also, the non-rigid transforms may include finite element modeling (FEM), B-spline transforms, Daemon's (fluid flow based) methods, diffusion based methods, optic flow based methods, or level-set based methods, for example. It may be noted that when one of the image data sets is being continually updated, such as a real-time 2D or 3D ultrasound image data set, a position sensing system and/or image-based analysis may be used to maintain registration.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described hereinabove, the registration platform <b>20</b> may be configured to facilitate the registration of the plurality of acquired image data sets to generate registered image data sets. Once registered, it may be desirable to visualize the registered image data sets on a display. There is therefore a need for a process that may be tailored to permit substantially superior visualization of the registered image data sets.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with aspects of the present technique, the processing module <b>18</b> may be configured to facilitate the display of the registered image data sets. Accordingly, in a presently contemplated configuration, the processing module <b>18</b> may include a visualization platform <b>22</b>, where the visualization platform <b>22</b> may be configured to facilitate a substantially enhanced visualization of the registered image data sets on a display, for example. The working of the visualization platform <b>22</b> will be described in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The processing module <b>18</b> may be accessed and/or operated via an operator console <b>24</b>. The operator console <b>24</b> may also be employed to facilitate the display of the registered image data sets generated by the processing module <b>18</b>, such as on a display <b>26</b> and/or a printer <b>28</b>. For example, an operator, such as a clinician, may use the operator console <b>24</b> to designate the manner in which the registered image and/or the pre-acquired image volume are visualized on the display <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a schematic flow chart <b>30</b> representative of the operation of the diagnostic system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and more particularly of the visualization platform <b>22</b> in the processing module <b>18</b>, is depicted. In other words, a method of visualizing a registered image using the system <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is depicted. In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference numeral <b>32</b> may be representative of a first image data set acquired via an image acquisition system, such as the first image acquisition system <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Also, reference numeral <b>34</b> may be representative of a registered image. In one embodiment, the registered image <b>34</b> may include a registered ultrasound image.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the present example, the first image data set <b>32</b> may be representative of a pre-acquired image volume, where the pre-acquired image volume may include image data representative of an anatomical region in the patient. Also, the first image data set <b>32</b> may be acquired via the first image acquisition system <b>12</b>. Further, the first image acquisition system <b>12</b> may include a CT imaging system configured to obtain an image volume representative of the anatomical region of interest in the patient, for example. Accordingly, the first image data set <b>32</b> may include CT image data. More particularly, in one embodiment, the CT image volume <b>32</b> may include a series of parallel planar images (slices) that are in a standard orientation relative to the body of the patient. For example, an abdominal scan in CT is normally done with the patient lying on his back and the slices are parallel to each other and transverse to the patient. Further, the first image data set <b>32</b>, acquired via the first image acquisition system <b>12</b> may be referred to as a &#x201c;reference&#x201d; image, where the reference image is the image that is maintained unchanged and thereby used as a reference. The reference image data set <b>32</b> may be representative of a pre-acquired image volume. It may be noted that the terms reference image, reference image data set, pre-acquired image volume, reference image volume, pre-acquired reference image volume, original image, source image and fixed image may be used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additionally, the other acquired images to be mapped onto the reference image may be referred to as &#x201c;floating&#x201d; images. In other words, the floating image embodies the image that is geometrically transformed to spatially align with the reference image <b>32</b>. It may also be noted that the terms floating image, moving image, sensed image and target image may be used interchangeably. Accordingly, a second image data set may be acquired via the second image acquisition system <b>14</b>, for example. Further, in the present example, the second image acquisition system <b>14</b> may include an ultrasound imaging system configured to obtain an image representative of the anatomical region of interest, for example. Accordingly, the second image data set may include ultrasound image data. More particularly, in one embodiment, the ultrasound image data may include a two-dimensional (2D) planar image (slice). It may be noted that the second image data set may include a 2D ultrasound image that is acquired in real-time. This 2D ultrasound image may also be referred to as a &#x201c;live&#x201d; ultrasound image. Alternatively, the second image data set may include a multi-planar or 3D ultrasound images that are acquired in real-time.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, this ultrasound image may be registered with the pre-acquired image volume <b>32</b> via use of the registration platform <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Registration techniques, such as, but not limited to rigid transformation, may be employed to register the ultrasound image with the reference image data set <b>32</b>. In other words, the ultrasound image data set may be geometrically transformed to spatially align with the pre-acquired image volume <b>32</b>. Consequent to processing by the registration platform <b>20</b>, the registered ultrasound image <b>34</b> may be generated. Position sensor and/or image-based processing may be used to continually keep the image data sets registered as the position of the live ultrasound image is updated.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Subsequent to receiving the registered ultrasound image <b>34</b> and the corresponding pre-acquired image volume <b>32</b>, it may be desirable to process the images <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> to facilitate visualization on a display, such as the display <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), thereby allowing a user, such as a clinician, to visualize the images <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and provide a diagnosis, for instance. In accordance with exemplary aspects of the present technique, a method for visualizing a registered image is presented. The method starts at step <b>36</b> where the registered floating ultrasound image <b>34</b> may be displayed on a first portion of the display <b>26</b>. It may be noted that at step <b>36</b> the entire registered floating ultrasound image <b>34</b> or at least a portion of the registered floating ultrasound image <b>34</b> may be displayed on a first portion of the display <b>26</b>. Subsequently, the pre-acquired reference image volume <b>32</b> may be displayed on a second portion of the display <b>26</b>, as depicted by step <b>38</b>. Here again, all of the pre-acquired reference image volume <b>32</b> or at least a portion of the pre-acquired reference image volume <b>32</b> may be displayed on the second portion of the display <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Additionally, in one embodiment, the registered ultrasound image <b>34</b> and the pre-acquired reference image volume <b>32</b> may be visualized on the display <b>26</b> in a side-by-side configuration, as depicted in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Accordingly, in the present example, the second portion of the display <b>26</b> may be adjacently disposed with reference to the first portion of the display <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Using the currently available techniques, the registered ultrasound image <b>34</b> may be displayed adjacent to the reference image volume <b>32</b>, thereby allowing the clinician to view the two image data sets <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> side by side, where the images <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are displayed in a substantially similar orientation and scale. More particularly, generally only a portion of the reference image volume <b>32</b> corresponding to the ultrasound image <b>34</b> is displayed, thereby disadvantageously resulting in a loss of context for the ultrasound image <b>34</b> in reference to the reference image volume <b>32</b>. For example, the pre-acquired image volume <b>32</b> may include CT image data, where the CT image data is generally representative of images of a cross-section of the body of the patient. One the other hand, the ultrasound image <b>34</b> may include ultrasound data that is acquired via an ultrasound transducer as the transducer is moved along the body of the patient. Hence, the CT image data in the pre-acquired image volume <b>32</b> may provide a relatively larger context to the ultrasound image <b>34</b>. However, if only a portion of the CT image data in the pre-acquired image volume <b>32</b> corresponding to the ultrasound image <b>34</b> is visualized along with the ultrasound image <b>34</b> such that both the images <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are displayed in a substantially similar scale, then this context may be lost.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The shortcomings of the currently available techniques may be advantageously overcome by allowing the clinician to selectively alter the display of the reference image data set <b>32</b> on the second portion of the display <b>26</b>. In other words, in accordance with exemplary aspects of the present technique, the clinician may be allowed to modify the scale of the reference image volume <b>32</b> such that the altered reference image volume is configured to provide a substantially larger context for the ultrasound image <b>34</b>, as depicted by step <b>40</b>. By way of example, in one embodiment, the clinician may be allowed to zoom out on the pre-acquired reference image volume <b>32</b> such that a side-by-side comparison between the ultrasound image <b>34</b> and the pre-acquired image volume <b>32</b> is substantially similar. More particularly, the system <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be configured to allow the clinician to selectively alter the display of at least a portion of the pre-acquired image volume <b>32</b> to provide an enhanced context to the registered ultrasound image <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In accordance with further aspects of the present technique, the system <b>10</b> may also be configured to provide a user-defined amount of additional image data to give a context to the ultrasound image <b>34</b>. In other words, using the system <b>10</b>, the clinician may incorporate additional information on the reference image data set <b>32</b> to provide a perspective to the ultrasound image <b>34</b> with respect to the reference image data set <b>32</b> displayed on the second portion of the display <b>26</b> of the system <b>10</b>, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a front view <b>50</b> of a display, such as the display <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is illustrated. More particularly, a method of visualizing a registered ultrasound image, in accordance with aspects of the present technique, is depicted. Reference numeral <b>52</b> may be representative of a first portion of the display <b>26</b>, while a second portion of the display <b>26</b> may generally be represented by reference numeral <b>54</b>. Also, reference numeral <b>56</b> may be indicative of a controls portion of the display <b>26</b>. As previously noted, a registered ultrasound image <b>58</b> may be displayed on the first portion <b>52</b> of the display <b>26</b>. It may be noted that the registered ultrasound image <b>58</b> may be representative of the ultrasound image <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Similarly, a pre-acquired reference image volume <b>60</b> may be visualized on the second portion <b>54</b> of the display <b>26</b>. Here again, the pre-acquired reference image volume <b>60</b> may be indicative of the reference image volume <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). It may be noted that in the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the registered ultrasound image <b>58</b> and the reference image volume <b>60</b> are displayed in a side-by-side configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, in the example presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, providing a substantially larger context for the ultrasound image <b>58</b> via use of the pre-acquired image volume <b>60</b> may circumvent disadvantages associated with the presently available techniques. More particularly, in the present example, the system <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be configured to provide the clinician an ability to zoom out on the pre-acquired volume data set <b>60</b> such that a side-by-side comparison between the registered ultrasound image <b>58</b> and the pre-acquired image volume <b>60</b> is substantially similar. In other words, the pre-acquired reference image volume <b>60</b> may now be visualized in a relatively reduced scale in comparison to the ultrasound image <b>58</b>. More particularly, the registered ultrasound image <b>58</b> may now have a zoom factor that is relatively different from a zoom factor of the pre-acquired reference image volume <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with further aspects of the present technique, a user-defined amount of additional image data may be incorporated to provide a context to the ultrasound image <b>58</b> via use of the pre-acquired image volume <b>60</b>. In the present example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the user-defined context may be provided via incorporation of a graphical outline <b>62</b> of the registered ultrasound image <b>58</b> on the pre-acquired image volume <b>60</b> displayed on the second portion <b>54</b> of the display <b>26</b>. The outline <b>62</b> may be representative of an outline of the registered ultrasound image <b>58</b> displayed on the first portion <b>52</b> of the display <b>26</b>, in one embodiment. By implementing the display of the registered ultrasound image <b>58</b> and the modified pre-acquired image volume <b>60</b> as described hereinabove, any information in the pre-acquired reference image volume <b>60</b> that lies outside of the graphical outline <b>62</b> may advantageously be employed to provide an anatomical context to the ultrasound image <b>58</b>. Alternatively, instead of using the graphical outline <b>62</b>, an intensity of an area outside the corresponding ultrasound area may be reduced to provide an anatomical context to the ultrasound image <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a front view <b>70</b> of a display, such as the display <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is illustrated. In other words, another method of visualizing a registered ultrasound image, in accordance with further aspects of the present technique, is depicted. Reference numeral <b>72</b> may be representative of a registered ultrasound image displayed on the first portion <b>52</b> of the display <b>26</b>. In certain embodiments, the ultrasound image <b>72</b> may be representative of the registered ultrasound image <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the system <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be configured to allow the clinician to view the entire context of a pre-acquired reference image volume <b>74</b>. Here again, the pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b> may be representative of the pre-acquired image volume <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). More particularly, the pre-acquired reference image volume <b>74</b> may be visualized in a predetermined orientation. The predetermined orientation may include a substantially fixed orientation, in one embodiment. It may be noted that, in a presently contemplated configuration, reference numeral <b>78</b> may be indicative of an outline of the pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, an image plane in the pre-acquired reference image volume that substantially matches the registered ultrasound image <b>72</b> may be extracted. Reference numeral <b>76</b> may be representative of the matching image plane in the pre-acquired reference image volume <b>74</b>. Additionally, in accordance with further aspects of the present technique, the matching image plane <b>76</b> may be displayed on the second portion <b>54</b> of the display <b>26</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the matching image plane <b>76</b> is shown in its position relative to the overall pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b>. In other words, the matching image plan <b>76</b> may be depicted at an angle within the outline <b>78</b> of the pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b>, in accordance with aspects of the present technique. Consequently, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the ultrasound image <b>72</b> and the corresponding matching image plane <b>76</b> that is currently displayed in its position within the pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b> may be displayed in a side-by-side display configuration. Also, as previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a graphical outline <b>79</b> representative of the ultrasound image <b>72</b> may be superimposed on the matching image plane <b>76</b> in the pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b> to provide an additional context to the ultrasound image <b>72</b>. Alternatively, instead of using the graphical outline <b>79</b>, an intensity of the area outside the corresponding ultrasound area may be reduced to provide additional context to the ultrasound image <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As will be appreciated, an ultrasound transducer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) may be employed to facilitate acquisition of ultrasound image data representative of an anatomical region of interest, where the acquired ultrasound image may be displayed as the ultrasound image <b>72</b> on the first portion <b>52</b> of the display <b>26</b>. It may be noted that in the present example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the ultrasound transducer is oriented in a plane of the matching image plane <b>76</b> in the pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b>. Moreover, if the ultrasound transducer is rotated about the Y-axis by about 180 degrees, then an orientation of the pre-acquired volume image data set may be reversed to facilitate maintaining a substantially consistent orientation between the ultrasound image <b>72</b> and the matching image plane <b>76</b> in the pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b>. Further, visualizing the entire pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b> on the second portion <b>54</b> of the display <b>26</b> may result in a relatively small display size of the pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b>. Accordingly, the system <b>10</b> may be configured to provide the clinician with a user adjustable zoom factor, where the user adjustable zoom factor may be used to trade off image size for anatomical context.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Implementing the display of the ultrasound image <b>72</b>, the matching image plane <b>76</b>, and the pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b> as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> advantageously allows the clinician to visualize the ultrasound image <b>72</b> in reference to the entire context of the pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b>, thereby providing a substantially enhanced anatomical context. More particularly, image data that lies outside of the graphical outline <b>79</b> provides an additional context to the ultrasound image <b>72</b>. Additionally, the clinician may visualize the entire pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b>. Further, the user-adjustable zoom-factor allows the clinician to adjust a field of view of the display of the pre-acquired image volume <b>74</b> on the second portion <b>54</b> of the display <b>26</b>, thereby providing a substantially enhanced anatomical context.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a front view <b>80</b> of a display, such as the display <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. More particularly, yet another method of visualizing a registered ultrasound image, in accordance with further aspects of the present technique, is depicted. In a presently contemplated configuration, at least a portion of the pre-acquired image volume may be visualized in a predetermined orientation, where the predetermined orientation does not include a substantially fixed orientation. In other words, in the present example, a registered ultrasound image <b>82</b> may be displayed in a side-by-side configuration along with a matching image slice in the corresponding pre-acquired image volume. Here again, as previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the system <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be configured to extract an image plane in the pre-acquired reference image volume that substantially matches the registered ultrasound image <b>82</b>. This matching image plane in the pre-acquired reference image volume may generally be represented by reference numeral <b>84</b>. In addition, in accordance with further aspects of the present technique, the matching image plane <b>84</b> may be displayed on the second portion <b>54</b> of the display <b>26</b>. Further, in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the matching image plane <b>84</b> may be oriented such that the matching image plane <b>84</b> is substantially parallel to the display <b>26</b>. Consequently, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the ultrasound image <b>82</b> may be visualized in a side-by-side display configuration along with the corresponding matching image plane <b>84</b> in the pre-acquired image volume. Also, as previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, an outline <b>86</b> representative of the registered ultrasound image <b>82</b> may be superimposed on the matching image plane <b>84</b> to provide an additional context to the ultrasound image <b>82</b> in the pre-acquired image volume. Alternatively, instead of using the graphical outline <b>86</b>, an intensity of the area outside the corresponding ultrasound area may be reduced to provide an enhanced anatomical context to the ultrasound image <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In accordance with further aspects of the present technique, a plurality of image planes from the pre-acquired image volume may be employed to provide an anatomical context to a registered ultrasound image. As will be appreciated, an ultrasound image may include a 2D image, while a pre-acquired image volume includes a three-dimensional (3D) volume.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Accordingly, in one embodiment, the registered ultrasound image may be simultaneously displayed along with one or more image planes from the corresponding pre-acquired reference image volume that intersect the ultrasound image. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, the center of the ultrasound image may be selected as a point of intersection between the ultrasound image and the pre-acquired image volume. Subsequently, one or more intersecting planes in the pre-acquired image volume that pass through the point of intersection may be selected to provide anatomical context to the ultrasound image. Alternatively, the clinician may select a point of intersection on the ultrasound image and accordingly select one or more image planes in the pre-acquired image volume that pass through the user-selected point of intersection. In accordance with further aspects of the present technique, one or more image planes in the pre-acquired image volume that are substantially parallel to the ultrasound image may be simultaneously displayed along with the ultrasound image. In addition, the ultrasound image may be displayed in a side-by-side configuration with a volume rendering of all or part of the pre-acquired image volume.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a front view <b>90</b> of a display, such as the display <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), is illustrated. More particularly, yet another method of visualizing a registered ultrasound image, in accordance with further aspects of the present technique, is depicted. Reference numeral <b>92</b> may be representative of a registered ultrasound image, while a pre-acquired image volume may generally be represented by reference numeral <b>98</b>. In a presently contemplated configuration, a matching image slice that substantially matches the ultrasound image <b>92</b> may be extracted from the pre-acquired image volume <b>98</b>. The extracted matching image slice and the ultrasound image <b>92</b> may be combined to generate a composite image. More particularly, the matching image slice may be colorized. In other words, the matching image slice may be mapped from a standard gray representation. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, reference numeral <b>94</b> may be representative of a colorized matching image slice in the pre-acquired image volume <b>98</b>. Subsequently, the colorized matching image slice <b>94</b> may be combined with the gray ultrasound image <b>92</b> to create a composite or overlay image <b>96</b>. Alternatively, the ultrasound image <b>92</b> may be colorized and combined with the pre-acquired image volume <b>98</b>, where the pre-acquired image volume <b>98</b> includes a grayscale image.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, information associated with the matching image slice <b>94</b> may also be extracted. The extracted information may also be combined with the ultrasound image <b>92</b> to generate a composite image. Subsequently, the composite image so generated may be displayed on the first portion <b>52</b> of the display <b>26</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">These composite images may then be visualized on the display <b>26</b> to provide a substantially superior anatomical context to the ultrasound image <b>92</b>. Further, in a presently contemplated configuration, this composite image <b>96</b> may be displayed on the first portion <b>52</b> of the display <b>26</b>. Also, as previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, an outline <b>100</b> representative of the ultrasound image <b>92</b> may be superimposed on the pre-acquired image volume <b>98</b> to provide an additional context to the ultrasound image <b>92</b> in the pre-acquired image volume <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In accordance with further aspects of the present technique, another method of visualizing a registered ultrasound image is presented. As will be appreciated, in normal ultrasound scanning, the B-mode or grayscale image is an anatomical representation. Additionally, ultrasound has the ability to generate vascular flow information using Color Doppler, Power Doppler, Contrast, Pulsatile Flow Detection and Colorize B Flow (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). This flow information may be displayed as an overlay on the ultrasound B-mode image <b>92</b>. In volume-guided ultrasound, this color overlay may be overlaid on the ultrasound image <b>92</b>, the corresponding matching slice in the pre-acquired volume image slice <b>98</b>, or both. In addition, a biopsy graphic overlay (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) may be combined with the ultrasound image <b>92</b>, the pre-acquired image volume <b>98</b>, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As will be appreciated, ultrasound image data representative of an anatomical region of interest may also be acquired via use of a volume transducer or a multi-planar transducer. Consequently, multiple ultrasound planes simultaneously representative of the anatomical region of interest may be obtained. Accordingly, the multiple ultrasound images so obtained may be displayed on the first portion <b>52</b> of the display <b>26</b>, while the corresponding matching slices from the pre-acquired image volume <b>98</b> may be displayed on the second portion <b>54</b> of the display <b>26</b>, for example. It may be noted that the various techniques described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, may also be extended to these multiple image cases, in accordance with aspects of the present technique.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, a volume ultrasound transducer may also be used to generate a volumetric view of the ultrasound image data representative of an anatomical region of interest. The volumetric view may include a rendering, for example. In accordance with yet another aspect of the present technique, the rendering so generated may be displayed in a side-by-side configuration with a rendering of a corresponding pre-acquired image volume, where the pre-acquired image volume is representative of the same anatomical region of interest. Alternatively, the rendering of the ultrasound image may be displayed in a side-by-side configuration with one or more image planes from the pre-acquired image volume. In other words, the rendering of the ultrasound image may be displayed on the first portion <b>52</b> of the display <b>26</b>, while the corresponding one or more planes from the pre-acquired image volume may be displayed on the second portion <b>54</b> of the display <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Typically, two or more image planes representative of an anatomical region of interest may be simultaneously acquired via a multi-planar transducer or volume transducer. In certain embodiments, these image planes may include two perpendicular planes, such as an A-plane and a B-plane. Also, in certain other embodiments, it may be desirable to obtain a third orthogonal plane, such as a C-plane, where the C-plane is generally substantially parallel to a face of the transducer. However, the acquisition of the C-plane may not be practical for real-time scanning as the acquisition of the C-plane may include the acquisition of an entire volume of information to capture desired data. This shortcoming may advantageously be circumvented in accordance with aspects of the present technique. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the ultrasound transducer may be configured to acquire and display the A-plane and the B-plane. The C-plane may be obtained from the corresponding pre-acquired image volume data set and displayed along with the A-plane and B-plane of the ultrasound image data. Also, the system <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be configured to allow the clinician to specify the depth of the C-plane.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Furthermore, in certain conditions, a substantially enhanced image quality may be desired. Accordingly, the system <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may also be configured to allow the clinician to obtain and display any of the A-plane, the B-plane, or the C-plane from the pre-acquired volume data set to provide the desired image quality. By implementing the visualization of the ultrasound image and the pre-acquired image volume as described hereinabove, image quality may be enhanced especially if the reference volume data set is pre-acquired with the same ultrasound probe from a different angle to avoid shadowing or other imaging artifacts.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, a graphical indicator and/or image-embedded indicators of the area that corresponds directly to ultrasound image area may be placed on the pre-acquired image volume, thereby providing a superior anatomical context to the registered ultrasound image and facilitating enhanced visualization. In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, an example of a graphical indication includes a graphical outline of the ultrasound image area incorporated on the image representative of the pre-acquired image volume. These image-embedded indications may advantageously be employed to enhance the visualization of the ultrasound image and the pre-acquired image volume. Accordingly, a variety of image-embedded indications are provided, in accordance with aspects of the present technique.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">By way of example, the image-embedded indication may include representing image data in the pre-acquired image volume corresponding to the ultrasound image in a first color, while other image data in the pre-acquired image volume may be represented in a second color, where the second color is different from the first color. Alternatively, the image data in the pre-acquired volume corresponding to the ultrasound image may be represented by a first shade of a color, while other image data in the pre-acquired image volume may be represented in a second shade of the same color, where the second shade is different from the first shade. According to further aspects of the present technique, a method of visualizing the registered image may include transparently overlaying the ultrasound image data onto a corresponding part of the pre-acquired image volume.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, simultaneous overlay viewing typically combines the ultrasound 2D image with a corresponding matching image slice in the pre-acquired image volume. For example, the simultaneous overlay may be generated by colorizing one of the ultrasound image or the pre-acquired image volume. In addition, some transparency may be employed to allow the clinician to view both image data sets. Alternatively, a combining algorithm may be employed to combine the two images at each point.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Presently available techniques typically combine the overlay viewing with simultaneous side-by-side viewing of the pre-acquired image volume, thereby providing a combined image on a first portion of a display and the uncombined pre-acquired volume slice on a second portion of the display. Also, in certain cases, the ultrasound 2D image slice may cover a relatively smaller area in comparison to an area covered by the corresponding matching image slice in the pre-acquired image volume. In accordance with aspects of the present technique, while combining the ultrasound image with the corresponding matching image slice from the pre-acquired image volume, a relatively larger slice area may be used, thereby providing a substantially greater anatomical context for the ultrasound image.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Combining the overlay viewing with the side-by-side viewing is dependent upon available screen space on the display. In other words, due to space constraints on the display, the simultaneous display of the combined image and the corresponding matching image slice unfortunately results in the images being partially clipped, displayed in a relatively small size, or both. As will be appreciated, the combined image includes information from the ultrasound image and the corresponding matching image slice in the pre-acquired image volume. This disadvantage may be overcome in accordance with aspects of the present technique. More particularly, in accordance with aspects of the present technique, only the overlaid combined image may be displayed on the entire screen space of the display <b>26</b>, thereby facilitating the display of an unclipped overlaid combined image. Additionally, the overlaid image may be displayed at a substantially larger size. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a front view <b>110</b> of a display, such as the display <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). More particularly, yet another method of visualizing a registered ultrasound image, in accordance with further aspects of the present technique, is depicted. Accordingly, a combined image, such as the combined image <b>96</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) may be displayed on the entire screen of the display <b>26</b>. As previously noted, the combined image <b>96</b> includes a color overlay <b>94</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) overlaid on the ultrasound image <b>92</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In accordance with further aspects of the present technique, a control may be provided on the system <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), where the control may be configured to allow the clinician to switch between visualizing the 2D ultrasound image only, the matching image slice in the 3D pre-acquired image volume only, or a desired mix of the 2D ultrasound image and the matching image slice in the pre-acquired image volume. The working of this control may be better understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a block diagram <b>120</b> illustrating an image acquisition system configured for use in the diagnostic system <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is depicted. The system <b>120</b> may be configured to acquire image data from a patient <b>122</b> via an image acquisition device <b>124</b>. Reference numeral <b>126</b> may be representative of a table configured to aid in positioning the patient <b>122</b> for an imaging session. In one embodiment, the image acquisition device <b>124</b> may include a probe, where the probe may include an invasive probe, or a non-invasive or external probe, such as an external ultrasound probe, that is configured to aid in the acquisition of image data. Also, in certain other embodiments, image data may be acquired via one or more sensors (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) that may be disposed on the patient <b>122</b>. By way of example, the sensors may include physiological sensors (not shown) such as electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors and/or positional sensors such as electromagnetic field sensors or inertial sensors. These sensors may be operationally coupled to a data acquisition device, such as an imaging system, via leads (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), for example.</p>

It should be noted that although the exemplary embodiments illustrated hereinafter are described in the context of a medical imaging system, other imaging systems and applications such as industrial imaging systems and non-destructive evaluation and inspection systems, such as pipeline inspection systems, liquid reactor inspection systems, are also contemplated. Additionally, the exemplary embodiments illustrated and described hereinafter may find application in multi-modality imaging systems that employ ultrasound imaging in conjunction with other imaging modalities, position-tracking systems or other sensor systems.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Additionally, the image data acquired and/or processed by the medical imaging system <b>128</b> may be employed to aid a clinician in identifying disease states, assessing need for treatment, determining suitable treatment options, guiding an interventional procedure, and/or monitoring the effect of treatment on the disease states. In certain embodiments, the processing subsystem <b>132</b> may be further coupled to a storage system, such as a data repository <b>134</b>, where the data repository <b>134</b> is configured to receive image data.</p>

In accordance with aspects of the present technique, the display <b>136</b> of the medical imaging system <b>128</b> may be configured to display an image generated by the medical imaging system <b>128</b> based on the image data acquired via the image acquisition device <b>124</b>. Additionally, the display <b>136</b> may also be configured to display a pre-acquired image volume, such as the reference image data set <b>52</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The display <b>136</b> may also be configured to facilitate visualization of a registered image, such as the registered image <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, the user interface <b>138</b> of the medical imaging system <b>128</b> may include a human interface device (not shown) configured to facilitate the clinician in manipulating image data displayed on the display <b>136</b>. The human interface device may include a mouse-type device, a trackball, a joystick, a stylus, or a touch screen configured to facilitate the clinician to identify the one or more regions of interest. However, as will be appreciated, other human interface devices, such as, but not limited to, a touch screen, may also be employed. Furthermore, in accordance with aspects of the present technique, the user interface <b>138</b> may be configured to aid the clinician in navigating through the images acquired by the medical imaging system <b>128</b>. Additionally, the user interface <b>138</b> may also be configured to aid in facilitating the visualization of the registered ultrasound image and the corresponding pre-acquired image volume or the matching image slice in the pre-acquired image volume, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In accordance with aspects of the present technique, the imaging system <b>128</b> may include a controls subsystem <b>140</b> configured to allow the clinician to switch between visualizing the 2D ultrasound image only, the pre-acquired image volume, or a desired mix of the 2D image and pre-acquired image volume. It may be noted that the visualization of the images may include visualizing the entire pre-acquired image volume or at least a portion of the pre-acquired image volume. The at least a portion of the pre-acquired image volume may include a matching image slice in the 3D pre-acquired image volume, where the matching image slice corresponds to the ultrasound image.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in a presently contemplated configuration, the controls subsystem <b>140</b> is illustrated as being operatively coupled to the user interface <b>138</b>. In the present example, the clinician may manipulate the controls subsystem <b>140</b> via use of the user interface <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts a front view <b>150</b> of the user interface <b>138</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). In the present example, the user interface <b>138</b> may include other controls <b>151</b>. The user interface <b>138</b> may also include controls <b>152</b> that are configured to allow the clinician to operate the controls subsystem <b>140</b>. By way of example, the controls <b>152</b> may include a rotary control <b>154</b>. In a presently contemplated configuration, the rotary control <b>154</b> may be configured to aid the clinician in switching between viewing the 2D ultrasound image only, viewing the 3D pre-acquired image volume only, or viewing a desired mix of the 2D image and the pre-acquired image volume.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a presently contemplated configuration, the rotary control <b>154</b> may be configured to include three positional settings, where the positional settings may be configured to corresponding to one of a viewing the 2D ultrasound image only, viewing the 3D pre-acquired image volume only, or viewing a desired mix of the 2D image and the pre-acquired image volume. Accordingly, the rotary control <b>154</b> may be configured to include a first positional setting <b>156</b>, a second positional setting <b>158</b> and a third positional setting <b>160</b>. If the clinician positions the rotary control <b>154</b> at the first positional setting <b>156</b>, then the medical imaging system <b>128</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) may be configured to display only the 2D registered ultrasound image. Further, the medical imaging system <b>128</b> may be configured to display only the pre-acquired image volume or at least a portion of the pre-acquired image volume, such as, but not limited to, a matching image slice, if the clinician positions the rotary control <b>154</b> in the second positional setting <b>158</b>. In addition, if the clinician positions the rotary control <b>154</b> in the third positional setting <b>160</b>, the medical imaging system <b>128</b> may be configured to display a desired mix of the ultrasound image and the matching image slice in the pre-acquired image volume. By implementing the rotary control <b>154</b> as described hereinabove, the clinician may effortlessly cycle through the three display settings.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Alternatively, in accordance with further aspects of the present technique, the rotary control <b>154</b> may also be configured to be pushed and/or turned. Pushing the rotary control <b>154</b> may be configured to cycle the system <b>10</b> between viewing the 2D ultrasound image only, viewing the 3D pre-acquired image volume only, or viewing a desired mix of the 2D image and the pre-acquired image volume. Furthermore, when the rotary control <b>154</b> is positioned in the viewing a desired mix of the 2D image and the pre-acquired image volume position, then turning the rotary control <b>154</b> may be configured to provide an adjustment of a desired mixing of the ultrasound image and the pre-acquired image volume in the combined image.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In another embodiment, the user interface <b>138</b> may include three separate controls to allow the clinician to switch between viewing the three images. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a front view <b>170</b> of another embodiment of the user interface <b>138</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) is illustrated. The user interface <b>138</b> is shown as including other controls <b>171</b>. Further, the user interface <b>138</b> may also include controls <b>172</b> that are configured to allow the clinician to operate the controls subsystem <b>140</b>. By way of example, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the controls subsystem <b>140</b> is shown as including three separate buttons to allow the clinician to switch between viewing the 2D ultrasound image only, viewing the 3D pre-acquired image volume only, or viewing a desired mix of the 2D image and the matching image slice in the pre-acquired image volume. Accordingly, in the present example, if a display of only the 2D ultrasound image is desired, then the clinician may select a display ultrasound image button <b>174</b>. Similarly, if a display of only the matching image slice is desired, then the clinician may select a display pre-acquired image button <b>176</b>. However, if a display of a desired mix of the ultrasound image and pre-acquired image volume is desired, then the clinician may select a display composite image button <b>178</b>. Here again, by implementing the controls <b>172</b> as described hereinabove, the clinician may effortlessly switch between the various displays by selecting one of the three buttons <b>174</b>, <b>176</b>, <b>178</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref>, the clinician may switch between viewing the 2D ultrasound image only, viewing the 3D pre-acquired image volume only, or viewing a desired mix of the 2D image and the matching image slice in the pre-acquired image volume. In accordance with yet another aspect of the present technique, a method of facilitating the generation of the desired mix of the 2D ultrasound image and the corresponding matching image slice is presented.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As will be appreciated, the design of a method configured to generate a composite image representative of a desired mix of the 2D ultrasound image and the pre-acquired image volume is of paramount significance as the acceptance of the display of a single overlaid composite image versus the simultaneous side-by-side display of the ultrasound image and the corresponding pre-acquired image volume may be dependent upon the quality of the composite image. In accordance with aspects of the present technique, a method for generating the composite image is presented. More particularly, the clinician may be allowed to select an intensity range of image data from the pre-acquired image volume to be mixed with the ultrasound image to generate the composite image. In one embodiment, the clinician may use a simple control to choose an absolute intensity of the pre-acquired image volume. Additionally, the clinician may also specify a lower threshold T<b>1</b> and an upper threshold T<b>2</b>. Subsequently, the clinician may specify if an intensity between the two thresholds T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b> or an intensity outside the two thresholds T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b> is to be mixed with the ultrasound image to generate the composite image. The system <b>10</b> may be configured to allow the clinician control of these thresholds. Furthermore, the system <b>10</b> may also be configured to view the portion of the image data in the pre-acquired image volume that satisfies the thresholds and consequently be mixed with the ultrasound image data. Moreover, in accordance with further aspects of the present technique, similar thresholds may also be applied to the ultrasound image instead of or in addition to the thresholds on the pre-acquired image volume.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The method of generating the composite image may be better understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a diagrammatic illustration <b>180</b> of the method of generating the composite image, such as the composite image <b>96</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The pre-acquired image volume may have a minimum intensity M<b>1</b> <b>182</b> and a maximum intensity of M<b>2</b> <b>184</b>. Consequently, the pre-acquired image volume has an intensity in a range from about M<b>1</b> to about M<b>2</b>. According to aspects of the present technique, the clinician may be configured to sub-divide this range M<b>1</b>&#x2192;M<b>2</b> into a plurality of sub-ranges by selecting two or more thresholds in the range. By way of example, the user may select a lower threshold T<b>1</b> <b>186</b> and an upper threshold T<b>2</b> <b>188</b>. Consequently, the range M<b>1</b>&#x2192;M<b>2</b> may be sub-divided into three sub-ranges. A first sub-range M<b>1</b>&#x2192;T<b>1</b> may be represented by reference numeral <b>190</b>, while reference numeral <b>192</b> may be indicative of a second sub-range T<b>1</b>&#x2192;T<b>2</b>. Also, a third sub-range T<b>2</b>&#x2192;M<b>2</b> may generally be represented by reference numeral <b>194</b>. It may be noted that each of these sub-ranges may be controlled via use of separate controls on the user interface <b>138</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref>), for example. These controls may be configured to facilitate generating a desired mix by combining of the 2D ultrasound image and the pre-acquired image volume. It may be noted that although in the present example the range M<b>1</b>&#x2192;M<b>2</b> is sub-divided into three sub-ranges, it will be understood that other number of sub-ranges are also envisaged in accordance with aspects of the present technique.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As noted hereinabove, the system <b>10</b> may be configured to allow the clinician to select image data either within a given sub-range or outside the given sub-range to be mixed with the ultrasound image. For example, if the clinician selects the first sub-range M<b>1</b>&#x2192;T<b>1</b> <b>190</b>, then the system <b>10</b> may be configured to mix about 0% of image data from the pre-acquired image volume having an intensity corresponding to this first sub-range <b>190</b> with about 100% of the ultrasound image data to generate the composite image. However, if the sub-range selected by the clinician includes the second sub-range T<b>1</b>&#x2192;T<b>2</b> <b>192</b>, then the system <b>10</b> may be configured to mix about 50% of image data in the pre-acquired image volume having an intensity corresponding to this second sub-range <b>192</b> with about 50% of the ultrasound image data to generate the composite image. Also, if the clinician selects the third sub-range T<b>2</b>&#x2192;M<b>2</b> <b>194</b>, then the system <b>10</b> may be configured to mix 100% of image data in the pre-acquired image volume having an intensity corresponding to this third sub-range <b>194</b> with about 0% of the ultrasound data to generate the composite image.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">By implementing the method of generating the composite image as described hereinabove, a substantially superior combination of the ultrasound image and the pre-acquired image volume may be obtained. Also, the system <b>10</b> may be configured to allow the clinician to specify a combination of the ultrasound image and the pre-acquired image volume and accordingly adjust the mix.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In accordance with aspects of the present technique, another example of generating the composite image, such as the composite image <b>96</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is presented. With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the pre-acquired image volume may have a minimum intensity M<b>1</b> <b>182</b> and a maximum intensity of M<b>2</b> <b>184</b>, and hence an intensity in a range from about M<b>1</b> to about M<b>2</b>. This range M<b>1</b>&#x2192;M<b>2</b> is sub-divided into a plurality of sub-ranges (M<b>1</b>&#x2192;T<b>1</b> <b>190</b>, T<b>2</b>&#x2192;M<b>2</b> <b>192</b>, T<b>2</b>&#x2192;M<b>2</b> <b>194</b>) by selecting two or more thresholds in the range, as previously noted.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As noted hereinabove, the system <b>10</b> may be configured to allow the clinician to select image data either within a given sub-range or outside the given sub-range to be mixed with the ultrasound image. In a present example, at the point M<b>1</b> <b>182</b>, the system may be configured to mix about 0% of image data from the pre-acquired image volume with about 100% of the ultrasound image data to generate the composite image. In addition, at point T<b>1</b> <b>186</b>, the system <b>10</b> may be configured to mix about 50% of image data from the pre-acquired image volume with about 50% of the ultrasound image data to generate the composite image. Furthermore, for points in between M<b>1</b> <b>182</b> and T<b>1</b> <b>186</b>, the combination may include a linear combination. For example, at point (T<b>1</b>&#x2212;M<b>1</b>)/2 the system <b>10</b> may be configured to mix about 25% of image data in the pre-acquired image volume with about 75% of the ultrasound image data to generate the composite image. Also, at point T<b>2</b> <b>188</b>, the system <b>10</b> may be configured to mix about 50% of image data from the pre-acquired image volume with about 50% of the ultrasound image data to generate the composite image, while at the point M<b>2</b> <b>184</b>, the system <b>10</b> may be configured to mix about 100% of image data from the pre-acquired image volume with about 0% of the ultrasound image data to generate the composite image. Other examples may include at point T<b>2</b>+(M<b>2</b>&#x2212;T<b>2</b>)/2, the system <b>10</b> may be configured to mix about 62.5% of image data from the pre-acquired image volume with about 37.5% of the ultrasound image data to generate the composite image.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the foregoing example, demonstrations, and process steps may be implemented by suitable code on a processor-based system, such as a general-purpose or special-purpose computer. It should also be noted that different implementations of the present technique may perform some or all of the steps described herein in different orders or substantially concurrently, that is, in parallel. Furthermore, the functions may be implemented in a variety of programming languages, including but not limited to C++ or Java. Such code, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, may be stored or adapted for storage on one or more tangible, machine readable media, such as on memory chips, local or remote hard disks, optical disks (that is, CD's or DVD's), or other media, which may be accessed by a processor-based system to execute the stored code. Note that the tangible media may comprise paper or another suitable medium upon which the instructions are printed. For instance, the instructions can be electronically captured via optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted or otherwise processed in a suitable manner if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The method of visualizing a registered ultrasound image and a corresponding pre-acquired image volume and the system for visualizing a registered image and a corresponding pre-acquired image volume described hereinabove dramatically simplify procedural workflow for imaging an anatomical region of interest in the patient. Using the various methods of visualizing the registered ultrasound image with the corresponding pre-acquired image volume or the corresponding image slice in the pre-acquired image volume advantageously allows the clinician to simultaneously view the two images, while overcoming the limitations of the presently available techniques where the side-by-side display of the two images is limited by the screen size or one of the two images require partial clipping. In addition by employing the techniques described hereinabove, a substantially enhanced anatomical context may be provided to the ultrasound image, thereby facilitating increased diagnostic confidence.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The description hereinabove of the embodiments of the methods for visualizing a registered image and the system have the technical effect of efficiently visualizing a registered ultrasound image and a corresponding pre-acquired image volume data set in a side-by-side configuration, thereby enhancing clinical workflow and facilitating superior diagnosis.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for knitting fabric using elastic yarns at least as part of knitting yarns.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Hitherto, there has been known a structure of a knitting machine that has tension sensors confronting to the knitting yarn feeding pathway so that becomes controllable of knitting yarns to be fed to knitting needles at a desired tension (for example, see Patent Citation 1). By suppressing fluctuation of the knitting yarn tension when a fabric is being knitted, sizes of stitch loops are able to be kept uniform. In a knitting fabric, hand value is lost unless sizes of stitch loops achieve a suitable relation to the thickness of the knitting yarn used. In a flatbed knitting machine, when general knitting yarns are used, the thickness of the knitting yarn is chosen to nearly correspond to the gauge that indicates the number of knitting needles per 25.4 mm (1 inch). In accordance with the knitting yarn thickness, the knitting yarn tension is chosen, too, in such a manner that the stitch loop size that can provide the hand value as a suitable fabric is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Of the knitting fabrics knitted with the knitting machine, for portions requiring large retractility properties, for example, for the wearing openings of socks and gloves, etc., elastic yarns with particularly large extension coefficient as compared to general knitting yarns are used. Elastic yarns are also called rubber yarns, etc., and are made from polyurethane fibers, polyether/ester based fibers, and other fibers with large elasticity and retractility properties. In the elastic yarns, other fibers are used in combination, together with fiber materials with large retractility properties. For example, in the structures called covered yarns, core span yarns, etc., the outside of core fiber with large retractility properties, is covered with other fibers. 1</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">The elastic yarns are sometimes used not as ground yarns which construct knitting fabric itself but as inserted yarns which are inserted in a knitting fabric. The elastic yarns which are used as inserted yarns are used for knitting in the elongated state with comparatively large tension applied and in the fabric after knitting, tension is released and the elastic yarns shrink. To use elastic yarns, and to controll yarn tension and feed length, enables to knit a fabric in a finished state nearly close to the hand value corresponding to the gauge larger than the gauge of the knitting machine used (for example, see Patent Citation 2).

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">Formation of stitch loops by knitting needles is intermittently performed when a fabric is being knitted, and therefore, the knitting yarn tension varies in response to knitting action of knitting needles. However, it is difficult to control tension to eliminate this kind of fluctuation and the tension is controlled while the knitting action of knitting needles are in a resting phase. For example, in the flatbed knitting machine, knitting needles are driven by a cam mounted to a carriage while the carriage is running back and forth along the linear needle bed and a knitting course of a fabric is formed. When the carriage reverses the running direction, the knitting action of knitting needles rests, and therefore, the knitting yarn tension is controlled during this phase. The tension control might be performed by returning the knitting yarn to the feed side when the tension of the knitting yarn lacks and by further feeing the knitting yarn when the knitting yarn tension is excessive.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">In the flatbed knitting machine, tension is adjusted before knitting each knitting course by dispatching and retracting actions of the knitting yarn by the knitting yarn sending device so that the tension achieves the designated value while measuring the tension in the yarn route pathway of the elastic yarn from the knitting yarn sending device to the knitting needles which receive the yarn fed. However, even if the tension is adjusted before knitting in this way and the elastic yarn is fed at a yarn sending length decided in accordance with the correspondence relationship between the yarn tension and elongation percentage, the tension after knitting the knitting course is changed from the designated value. This change may be caused by slip of the elastic yarn in the yarn sending device, resistance in the yarn route pathway, or difference between the sending length of the elastic yarn and the consumption in the fabric by actual knitting, and others. Continuing knitting under this change and under the condition in which the tension of the elastic yarn differs from the designated value results in a different knitting width and different hand value of the knit products to be knitted.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">Because starting to knit after the tension in the yarn route pathway is set to the designated value before knitting each knitting course does not generate any tension change in the knitting course, it is expected that the knitting width and the hand value of the fabric to be knitted could be kept constant. In order to match the tension of the elastic yarn to the designated value, the elastic yarn must be fed back by the yarn sending device for each knitting course and the yarn sending length must be corrected in the following knitting course. In order to carry out this kind of yarn sending length correction by the yarn sending device, the amount of sending out the elastic yarn from the yarn sending device to the yarn route pathway or the amount of pulling back the elastic yarn by the yarn sending device from the yarn route pathway must be decided. While this kind of action to decide or to correct is being performed by the yarn sending device, the carriage must be stopped or the elastic yarn must not be used for the following knitting course. This is because the accurate value is difficult to be detected because the tension varies during knitting by the use of the elastic yarn. When the carriage is stopped, the knitting efficiency is lowered, and when the elastic yarn is not used for the following knitting course, restrictions are applied to a knitting pattern, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and a method for knitting fabric using elastic yarns, on which the elastic yarns can be used while correcting the difference between a set tension and an actual tension without being subject to a lowered knitting efficiency and to restrictions to knitting patterns.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">The present invention provides an apparatus for knitting fabric using elastic yarns with retractility properties which are fed to knitting needles at least as part of knitting yarns for knitting fabrics under a designated tension T<b>1</b>, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">a yarn sending device that sends elastic yarns to knitting needles at a designated yarn sending length F;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">a tension meter that confronts yarn route pathway established between the yarn sending device and the knitting needles, and detects tension T<b>2</b> of elastic yarns in a resting phase;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">means for calculating difference to commute a length L of elastic yarns, present in the yarn route pathway under the tension T<b>1</b> designated to the yarns and under the tension T<b>2</b> which the tension meter detects, into natural lengths L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> when the tensions T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b> are not exerted respectively, and to calculate the difference of natural lengths L<b>1</b>&#x2212;L<b>2</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">means for correcting yarn sending length F of the yarn sending device so that the difference between natural lengths L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> calculated by the means for calculating difference decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">The present invention provides the apparatus for knitting fabric using elastic yarns, further comprising</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">means for holding relationship that actually measures the correspondence relation between the tension T and the elongation percentage &#x3b1; of elastic yarns by the use of the yarn sending device and the tension meter, and holds measured results as data,</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">wherein said means for calculating difference commutes the elastic yarn lengths in the yarn route pathway into said natural lengths L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> on the basis of the correspondence relation between the tension T and the elongation percentage &#x3b1; held in the means for holding relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">The present invention provides the apparatus for knitting fabric using elastic yarns,</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">wherein said means for correcting yarn sending length corrects the elastic yarn sending length with respect to a changed portion of the sending length associated with elastic deformation when the elastic yarns are fed by the yarn sending device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">The present invention provides the apparatus for knitting fabric using elastic yarns,</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">wherein the apparatus for knitting fabric is a flatbed knitting machine in which a carriage runs back and forth along a needle bed extending linearly, and</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">said resting phase is at least one of timings in which the carriage reverses the running direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for knitting fabric used under a designated tension T<b>1</b> by feeding elastic yarns with retractility properties at least as part of the knitting yarns from a yarn sending device to knitting needles at a designated yarn sending length F, comprising steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">providing a tension meter for detecting tension T<b>2</b> of elastic yarns during knitting resting phase, which is installed in a yarn route pathway located between a yarn sending device and knitting needles;</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0028">correcting yarn sending length F of the yarn sending device so that the difference between natural lengths L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> decreases.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">According to the present invention, the tension T<b>2</b> of elastic yarns is only to be detected during resting phase of knitting by a tension meter, so that short resting phase of knitting with use of elastic yarns is acceptable, and the lowered knitting efficiency and restrictions to knitting patterns can be avoided. The means for calculating difference commutes the length L existing in the yarn route pathway into the natural length L<b>2</b> when no tension T<b>2</b> is exerted, and calculates difference between the natural length L<b>2</b> and the natural length L<b>1</b> under the designated tension T<b>1</b>. The means for correcting yarn sending length corrects the yarn sending length F of the yarn sending device in such a manner that the difference between natural lengths L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> decreases, and therefore, elastic yarns are able to be used while the difference between the set tension and the actual tension is being corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">In addition, according to the present invention, the correspondence relationship between the tension T and the elongation percentage &#x3b1; of elastic yarns is actually measured by the use of a yarn sending device and a tension meter which the knitting machine is equipped with, and is kept as data, and therefore, the data necessary for knitting by the use of elastic yarns is able to be obtained and kept by the knitting machine itself. The means for calculating difference commutes the elastic yarn length in the yarn route pathway into the natural length L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> on the basis of the correspondence relationship between the tension T and elongation percentage, and is therefore able to easily correct the yarn sending length for elastic yarns actually used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the elastic yarn sending length is corrected with respect to the changed portion of the sending length associated with elastic deformation when elastic yarns are fed by the yarn sending device, and therefore, the accuracy of yarn sending length correction can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">Still furthermore, according to the present invention, the tension T<b>2</b> in the yarn-handling course is detected for correcting the yarn feed rate during a period in which the carriage reverses the running direction between knitting courses of the flat knitting machine, and therefore, the yarn tension can be controlled without lowering the knitting efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">Still additionally, according to the present invention, the tension T<b>2</b> of elastic yarns is detected during resting phase, elastic yarns are therefore able to be used without lowering of the knitting efficiency and restrictions to knitting patterns, while correcting the difference between the set tension and the actual tension.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> simplistically shows an overall structure of a knitting machine <b>1</b> as one embodiment of the present invention. For the convenience of explanation, in the knitting machine <b>1</b>, only main component parts related for the use of elastic yarns are shown. Furthermore, even main component parts may be shown with the relative sizes and directions varied.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0051">In the knitting machine <b>1</b>, cams mounted to a carriage <b>3</b> is worked on knitting needles arranged in a needle bed <b>2</b> at predetermined pitches while the carriage <b>3</b> is running back and forth along the longitudinal direction of the needle bed <b>2</b>. The carriage <b>3</b> runs accompanied by a yarn feeder <b>4</b> and knitting yarns are fed to the knitting needles from the yarn feeder <b>4</b>. A rubber yarn <b>5</b> which is an elastic yarn is fed from the yarn feeder <b>4</b> to knitting needles as, for example, an insertion yarn to a fabric. The rubber yarn <b>5</b> is fed to a yarn route pathway passing a tension meter <b>7</b> from, for example, rubber yarn cone <b>6</b> supported by the side surface of the knitting machine <b>1</b> via a yarn sending device <b>8</b> and is used for knitting a fabric <b>9</b> in the needle bed <b>2</b>. The yarn route pathway of the knitting machine <b>1</b> passes the tension meter <b>7</b> installed at the upper side so that the knitting yarn is fed by a downward yarn feeding.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0052">The yarn sending length F of the yarn sending device <b>8</b> is corrected by a control equipment <b>10</b>. The control equipment <b>10</b> includes CPU<b>11</b>, memory <b>12</b>, and others, and functions as a relationship holding section <b>13</b>, difference calculating section <b>14</b>, yarn sending control section <b>15</b>, etc. in accordance with a program stored in the memory <b>12</b>. To the control equipment <b>10</b>, an operation input section <b>16</b> equipped with a keyboard, switches, etc., a display section <b>17</b> that displays picture images, commands, status, etc. are connected, too.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0053">To the tension meter <b>7</b>, a tension sensor <b>7</b><i>a </i>is equipped and is able to detect at any time the tension T of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> which is fed from the yarn sending device <b>8</b> to the knitting needles on the needle bed <b>2</b> via the yarn feeder <b>4</b>. In the knitting machine <b>1</b>, when the carriage <b>3</b> runs back and forth, the carriage <b>3</b> reverses the running direction when it passes the knitting end of the fabric <b>9</b>. When the carriage <b>3</b> reverses the running direction outside the knitting width of the fabric <b>9</b>, feed of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> to the knitting needles is stopped. During this resting phase, tension T<b>2</b> of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is detected by the tension meter <b>7</b>. The yarn sending length F, which is the amount of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> sent from the yarn sending device <b>8</b> to the yarn route pathway for each knitting course, is able to be obtained in advance as length of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> consumed under the designated tension T<b>1</b> for each knitting course. When the set accuracy of the yarn sending length F is high, the tension T<b>2</b> detected between relevant knitting courses is expected to be close to the designated tension T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0054">The yarn sending device <b>8</b> sends out the rubber yarn <b>5</b> to the yarn route pathway from a location A contained between a drive pulley <b>8</b><i>a </i>and a press pulley <b>8</b><i>b </i>to a location C at which the yarn is fed to the knitting needles via a location B at which the yarn comes out from the tension meter <b>7</b>. Of the yarn route pathway, the section from the location A to the location B is constant. The section between the location B and the location C varies as the carriage <b>3</b> runs, but is able to be calculated from position data of the carriage <b>3</b>. The drive pulley <b>8</b><i>a </i>is driven by a motor <b>8</b><i>c</i>. The motor <b>8</b><i>c </i>is able to rotate normally and reversely. In normal rotation, the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is sent out to the yarn route pathway, and in reverse rotation, the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is pulled back from the yarn route pathway. When the motor <b>8</b><i>c </i>is reversed to pull back the rubber yarn <b>5</b>, a yarn guiding member <b>8</b><i>d </i>is installed with care to prevent from being tangled in the yarn sending device <b>8</b> so as to be smoothly returned to the rubber yarn cone <b>6</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> show examples of measurement data with respect to the relationship between the tension T (N) and the elongation percentage &#x3b1; (%) of the rubber yarn <b>5</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the overall data held as the rubber yarn characteristics table in a relationship holding section <b>13</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>) shows partial data. The tension Tu used as a unit is, for example, about 0.01N (0.001 kgf). The tension T is measured by feeding and holding the rubber yarn <b>5</b> to the knitting needles via the yarn route pathway and adjusted to bring tension T detected by the tension meter <b>7</b> to nearly zero. However, the tension meter <b>7</b> lowers the detection accuracy when the tension T becomes nearly zero. When the tension T becomes nearly zero, the elongation percentage &#x3b1; of the rubber tarn <b>5</b> is 100%, and the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is in the natural length state.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0056">The correspondence relationship of the elongation percentage &#x3b1; to the tension T as in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) is able to be measured by bringing the tension T to the vicinity of zero, then, reversing the motor <b>8</b><i>c </i>of the yarn sending device <b>8</b>, and pulling back the rubber yarn <b>5</b> from the yarn route pathway. The rubber yarn <b>5</b> returned from the reversed drive pulley <b>8</b><i>a </i>to the rubber yarn cone <b>6</b> side has the tension T brought to the zero state, and therefore, the elongation percentage &#x3b1; is able to be obtained from the relationship between the pull-back length by the drive pulley <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the length L of the yarn route pathway. For example, pulling back the rubber yarn <b>5</b> by &#xbd;L, the length one half of the yarn route pathway length L, achieves the state in which the rubber yarn <b>5</b> of natural length &#xbd;L is stretched to the length L of the yarn route pathway, and the elongation percentage &#x3b1; becomes 200%. Pulling it back by &#x2154; L in natural length results in 300% elongation percentage &#x3b1;.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>) shows a range of the elongation percentage &#x3b1; of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> from 200% to 300%, which is enlarged assuming a case of using the rubber yarn <b>5</b> to be knitted in this range. For example, when the tension T<b>1</b> is designated to be set to 8.0 Tu, the corresponding elongation percent a is 268%. Meanwhile, when the actual tension T<b>2</b> actually detected after the completion of certain knitting course is, for example, 7.6 Tu, the elongation percentage &#x3b1; becomes 255%. The actual tension T<b>2</b> is lowered from the set tension T<b>1</b>, and this indicates that the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is sent in excess. Consequently, by correcting the sending length of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> to be reduced in the following knitting course, it is expected that the actual tension T<b>2</b> next measured would increase.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows schematically the procedures to use the rubber yarn <b>5</b> for knitting while the control equipment <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is correcting the yarn sending length. In Step a<b>0</b>, the knitting machine <b>1</b> begins to be used, and in Step a<b>1</b>, the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is set to the knitting machine <b>1</b>. First of all, a rubber yarn cone <b>6</b> is mounted to a holder, and the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is pulled out and fed from the yarn sending device <b>8</b> to the knitting needles via the tension meter <b>7</b> and the yarn feeder <b>4</b>. In Step a<b>2</b>, judgment as to whether the characteristics as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> should be measured is made by an operator using an operation input section <b>16</b>. When the characteristics are measured, in Step a<b>3</b>, the tension meter <b>7</b> and the yarn sending section <b>8</b> are utilized to obtain the foregoing data on correspondence relationship between the tension T and the elongation percentage &#x3b1; in accordance with the program created in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0059">When either measurement in step a<b>3</b> is finished or characteristics measurement is judged to be not required in step a<b>2</b>, knitting of fabric using the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is started in step a<b>4</b>. In Step a<b>5</b>, the yarn sending length F necessary for the following knitting course is designated. The yarn sending control section <b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> controls the motor <b>8</b><i>c</i>, so as to feed the rubber yarn <b>5</b> at the designated sending length F from the yarn sending device <b>8</b> to the yarn route pathway over a period of the following knitting course.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0060">In Step a<b>6</b>, a fabric of the following knitting course is knitted while using the rubber yarn <b>5</b> at the designated yarn sending length. In Step a<b>7</b>, it is determined whether the knitting to use the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is to be finished. When the knitting is determined not to be finished, the process moves to Step a<b>8</b> and the tension T of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is measured by the tension meter <b>7</b>. This measurement is performed while the supply and the consumption of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> are stopped because the carriage <b>3</b> reverses the running direction. Consequently, the tension T is able to be measured in a state free of any variation and without lowering the knitting efficiency, and is designated as the actual tension T<b>2</b>. In addition, even in the following knitting course, the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is able to be used too, and no restriction results in a knitting pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0061">In Step a<b>9</b>, the difference calculating section <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> calculates natural lengths L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> existing in the yarn route pathway of length L under the set tension T<b>1</b> and under the actual tension T<b>2</b>, respectively, in accordance with following Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) and further calculates the difference &#x394;L in accordance with Eq. (3).</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0067">If &#x394;L is positive, the adjustment ratio &#x3b2; calculated by Eq. (4) becomes larger than 100%, and the sending length of the following knitting course increases. The actual tension T<b>2</b> after the completion of the following knitting course lowers and the corresponding natural length L<b>2</b> increases, and it is expected that the difference between the natural length L<b>1</b> and the natural length L<b>2</b> decreases. In addition, when &#x394;L is negative, the adjustment ratio &#x3b2; becomes smaller than 100% and the sending length of the following knitting course decreases. The actual tension T<b>2</b> after the completion of the following knitting course increases and the corresponding natural length L<b>2</b> decreases, and it is expected that the difference between the natural length L<b>1</b> and the natural length L<b>2</b> becomes decreases, too. At any rate, the yarn sending length is corrected in the direction in which the difference between natural lengths L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0068">Because the yarn sending length per 1 step is fixed if the motor <b>8</b><i>c </i>is a stepping motor, the yarn sending length is able to be obtained as the number of steps to drive the motor <b>8</b><i>c</i>. The yarn sending length, to be necessary for the following knitting course, is able to be obtained by multiplying the yarn sending length at the set tension T<b>1</b> by the final adjustment ratio which is the product of the adjustment ratio &#x3b2; calculated by Eq. (4) multiplied by the adjustment ratio in the last knitting course.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0069">Incidentally, when the adjustment ratio &#x3b2; is calculated, it is desirable to correct the rubber yarn sending length for the difference &#x394;L. In the structure like the yarn sending device <b>8</b>, the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is pinched between the drive pulley <b>8</b><i>a </i>and press pulley <b>8</b><i>b </i>and to sent out. Between the drive pulley <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the press pulley <b>8</b><i>b</i>, the rubber yarn <b>5</b> gets crushed and an error is generated in the length of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> sent out. For example, even if the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is sent out the yarn sending length of 100 mm from the yarn sending device <b>8</b>, the natural length of actual rubber yarn <b>5</b> may be 80 mm. In such event, the difference should be corrected by &#x394;L/0.8.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0070">When correction of the yarn sending length in Step a<b>10</b> is finished, the corrected yarn sending length is designated and the course knitting from Step a<b>6</b> is repeated. In Step a<b>7</b>, if the knitting, in which the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is used, is determined to be finished, the procedure for using the rubber yarn <b>5</b> for knitting is finished in Step a<b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of yarn sending length correction performed when the fabric <b>9</b> is knitted by using the rubber yarn <b>5</b> in accordance with the procedure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by the knitting machine <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this example, the yarn sending length is corrected not in each knitting course but every time the carriage <b>3</b> runs back and forth. In the first knitting course <b>1</b>, for example, knitting is started after the tension t<b>0</b> such as 8.0Tu of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is designated as the set tension T<b>1</b>, and the actual tension T<b>2</b> right before the course is adjusted to t<b>0</b>. The sending length, which is the sending length from the yarn sending device <b>8</b>, requires the theoretical value F<b>0</b> at tension t<b>0</b>. Because this is the first knitting course, the calculation value of the adjustment ratio &#x3b2;, previous value, and final value shall be all set to 100%, and the correction value of the sending length shall be set to F<b>0</b>, too. In the following knitting course <b>2</b>, the knitting direction is reversed to the direction of the knitting course <b>1</b>, but the sending length correction value is set to F<b>0</b> and is not changed. The actual tension T<b>2</b> right before the course may differ from the set tension t<b>0</b>, but measurement does not take place.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0072">In knitting courses <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, the actual tension T<b>2</b> right before the course is measured as t<b>1</b>, and the difference &#x394;L of the natural length is calculated based on the difference from t<b>0</b> as the set tension T<b>1</b>, and the sending length F<b>0</b> is corrected. When the calculated value of the adjustment ratio &#x3b2; calculated by Eq. (4) becomes 73% based on the difference &#x394;L, the adjustment ratios of 100% in the previous knitting courses <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are multiplied and the final value of the adjustment ratio becomes 73%. Consequently, the sending length correction value becomes 0.73&#xd7;F<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0073">In the knitting course <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, the actual tension T<b>2</b> right before the course is measured as t<b>2</b>, and, the difference &#x394;L of the natural length is calculated based on the difference from t<b>0</b> as the set tension T<b>1</b>, and the sending length F<b>0</b> is corrected. When the calculated value of the adjustment rate &#x3b2; calculated by Eq. (4) becomes 104% based on the difference &#x394;L, the adjustment ratio of 73% in the previous knitting courses <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> is multiplied and the final value of the adjustment ratio becomes 75%. Consequently, the sending length correction value becomes 0.75&#xd7;F<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0074">In the knitting courses <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, the actual tension T<b>2</b> right before the course is measured as t<b>3</b>, and, the difference &#x394;L of the natural length is calculated based on the difference from t<b>0</b> as the set tension T<b>1</b>, and the sending length F<b>0</b> is corrected. When the calculated value of the adjustment rate &#x3b2; calculated by Eq. (4) becomes 114% based on the difference &#x394;L, the adjustment ratio of 75% in the previous knitting courses <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> is multiplied and the final value of the adjustment ratio becomes 85%. Consequently, the sending length correction value becomes 0.85&#xd7;F<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0075">For the subsequent knitting courses, sending length correction value can be obtained in the same manner. Incidentally, needless to say, the sending length correction value may be calculated for each knitting course. Because the knitting yarn is fed by the downward yarn feeding in the knitting machine <b>1</b>, the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is able to be fed under the nearly same conditions in whichever running direction of the carriage <b>3</b>, highly accurate yarn sending length correction can be achieved even when control is performed for each of reciprocating knitting course.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an example of a knitting machine <b>21</b> as another embodiment of the present invention, in which the sending length correction value is preferable to be calculated for each knitting course. In the knitting machine <b>21</b>, like reference characters are assigned to the portions corresponding to those of the knitting machine <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and redundant explanations will be omitted. In the knitting machine <b>21</b>, side yarn feeding is carried out, in which the rubber yarn <b>5</b> being fed is supported at the side of the frame <b>22</b>, and the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is fed by a sideward yarn feeding from one side of the longitudinal direction of the needle bed <b>2</b>. Consequently, in accordance with the direction in which the carriage <b>3</b> takes away the yarn feeder <b>4</b>, the length of the rubber yarn <b>5</b>, fed to the yarn route pathway, varies. When the yarn feeder <b>4</b> comes close to the feed side, the yarn feeder <b>4</b> moves and feeds the rubber yarn <b>5</b> already fed to the yarn route pathway to the knitting needles. Consequently, the amount of rubber yarn <b>5</b> sent out from the yarn sending device <b>8</b> during the knitting course decreases. When the carriage <b>3</b> runs away from the feed side, a large amount of rubber yarn <b>5</b> must be sent out from the yarn sending device <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0077">In this kind of knitting machine <b>21</b>, it is preferable that the sending length is corrected for each knitting course, and in addition, the yarn route pathway is set in a range to the knit end of the fabric <b>9</b> on each knitting course finishing side. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for convenience of explanation, the carriage <b>3</b> is brought to rightward outside of the fabric <b>9</b> but the figure shows the condition in which the yarn feeder <b>4</b> runs leftwards to come close to the feed side of the rubber yarn <b>5</b>. In this case, the knitting end on the left side of the fabric <b>9</b> becomes the location C at the end of the yarn route pathway. In the knitting course in which the yarn feeder <b>4</b> is took away by the carriage <b>3</b> runs rightwards, the location C becomes the knitting end on the right side of fabric <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0078">In the foregoing description, flatbed knitting machines are used, as knitting machines <b>1</b>, <b>21</b>, but the present invention is able to be applied to knitting machines of other types. For example, in a circular knitting machine for continuously knitting fabrics, a short resting phase is to be provided for measuring the actual tension T<b>2</b>. The length of this resting phase may be any length necessary for stably measuring actual tension T<b>2</b> and is able to be made shorter than the period necessary for adjusting the set tension T<b>1</b> to suppress lowering of the production efficiency and to be free of restrictions to a knitting pattern. In addition, the correspondence relationship between the elongation percentage &#x3b1; and tension T of the rubber yarn <b>5</b> is actually measured and stored in the relationship holding section <b>13</b> as a rubber yarn characteristic table. Alternatively, the data measured by a test device other than the knitting machines <b>1</b>, <b>21</b> may be loaded. Furthermore, this correspondence relationship may be utilized after mathematization.</p>
