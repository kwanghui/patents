<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an ice maker, and more particularly, to an ice maker having a fan assembly, wherein cold air is supplied to an ice-making tray of the ice maker so that ice can be more rapidly made.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A refrigerator is provided with an ice maker to make and provide ice to a user. In the ice maker, cold air with relatively low temperature within the refrigerator is supplied to a tray of the ice maker so that ice can be more rapidly made. A conventional ice maker with such a structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the ice maker as shown in the figure, a main body <b>1</b> of the ice maker is provided with an ice-making tray <b>3</b>. Generally, the ice-making tray <b>3</b> is a portion in which ice is actually made, and is partitioned into a plurality of spaces. Reference numeral <b>5</b> is an ice-detecting lever. A driving unit <b>7</b> in which a driving motor for driving the ice-making tray <b>3</b> and the ice-detecting lever <b>5</b> is located is provided at a side of the main body <b>1</b> of the ice maker.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A fan assembly <b>10</b> is detachably installed at the driving unit <b>7</b>. The fan assembly <b>10</b> forcibly supplies cold air toward the ice-making tray <b>3</b> to more rapidly make ice.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The structure of the fan assembly <b>10</b> will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A housing <b>12</b> defines an external appearance of the fan assembly <b>10</b>. A fan housing <b>14</b> is installed within the housing <b>12</b>. A sirocco fan <b>16</b> is installed within the fan housing <b>14</b>. The sirocco fan <b>16</b> serves to cause cold air to flow toward the ice-making tray <b>3</b>. The sirocco fan <b>16</b> is driven by a fan motor <b>15</b> installed at a side of the fan housing <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A duct housing <b>17</b> is provided at a side of the housing <b>12</b>. An inlet <b>18</b> is formed at a side of the duct housing <b>17</b>. The inlet <b>18</b> is a passage through which cold air within the refrigerator is introduced into the housing <b>12</b> by means of the sirocco fan <b>16</b>. A discharge duct <b>19</b> is provided integrally at a side of the duct housing <b>17</b>. An outlet <b>20</b> that is open toward a lower portion of the ice-making tray <b>3</b> is formed at an end of the discharge duct <b>19</b>. The cold air forcibly delivered by the sirocco fan <b>16</b> is discharged through the outlet <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, a housing cover <b>22</b> is provided to define a side surface of the housing <b>12</b>, more specifically, a surface of the housing <b>12</b> opposite to the main body <b>1</b> of the ice maker. The housing cover <b>22</b> defines a side surface of the external appearance of the fan assembly <b>10</b>. The housing cover <b>22</b> is provided with a switch <b>23</b> for manipulating the fan motor <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile, in the conventional ice maker with the fan assembly constructed as above, the operation of the fan assembly is controlled as follows. The sirocco fan <b>16</b> is driven only when the ice maker is operated. That is, in order to reduce time required for making ice, the sirocco fan <b>16</b> is driven after water is supplied to the ice maker. Accordingly, the sirocco fan <b>16</b> is not driven during the ice maker is not operated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">First, water is supplied into the ice-making tray <b>3</b>. This step is performed by operating a water-supplying valve for a period of time that has been already set in a control unit. When the supply of water is completed, the control unit applies a driving signal so that electric power can be supplied to the fan motor <b>15</b>. The fan motor <b>15</b> is driven in response to the driving signal and generates power for rotating the sirocco fan <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Here, the rotating operation of the sirocco fan <b>16</b> is performed until water supplied to the ice-making tray <b>3</b> is frozen into ice and thus the process of making ice is completed. Accordingly, the control unit detects temperature through a temperature-detecting unit for detecting temperature at the ice-making tray <b>3</b> and continuously drives the sirocco fan <b>16</b> until the detected temperature is reached to a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the temperature detected through the temperature-detecting unit is equal to temperature that has been already set for a moment when the process of making ice is completed, the control unit controls an ice-releasing operation. Prior to this, the control unit outputs a control signal for cutting off the electric power supplied to the fan motor to stop the rotating operation of the sirocco fan <b>16</b>. Therefore, when the electric power supplied to the fan motor <b>15</b> is cut off, the power for rotating the fan <b>16</b> is also cut off.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, the control unit outputs a signal to a motor that is provided in the driving unit <b>7</b>. Then, the motor generates power for releasing the ice. The ice-releasing power is transmitted to an ice-releasing lever that in turn is rotated to release the ice from the ice-making tray <b>3</b>. The released ice is stored in an ice storage container located below the ice-making tray.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the ice-releasing operation is completed, the control unit restarts the sirocco fan <b>16</b>. That is, the control unit performs control to again supply the electric power to the fan motor so that the fan motor <b>15</b> can be operated. In such a way, the sirocco fan <b>16</b> is rotated again.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Meanwhile, after the control unit performs the ice-releasing operation, it performs the process of checking the amount of ice stored in the ice storage container in order to determine whether to perform the process of making ice again. To this end, power for an ice-detecting operation is supplied from the motor in the driving unit <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The ice-detecting lever <b>5</b> is rotated by means of the power generated as above and determines whether the ice storage container has been fully filled with ice. When the ice-detecting lever <b>5</b> comes into contact with ice and is restricted in view of its rotating range during rotation thereof, a micro switch constructed to be mechanically interlocked with the ice-detecting lever <b>5</b> is operated to generate a signal according to the full state of the ice and transmit the signal to the control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Once the control unit recognizes that the ice storage container is fully filled with the ice, the control unit no longer controls the ice-making operation. Then, the control unit applies a signal for cutting off the electric power supplied to the fan motor so as to stop the operation of the fan motor <b>15</b>. Here, since the ice-making operation is no longer performed, the rotation of the fan <b>16</b> is also limited. However, if a state where the ice storage container is not fully filled with ice is detected, the control unit repeatedly performs control of the water-supplying operation, the ice-making operation and the ice-releasing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, there are the following problems in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">First, a relatively great number of parts are required to construct the fan assembly <b>10</b>. The additional fan motor <b>15</b> is required for driving the fan <b>16</b> and the fan housing <b>14</b> is required for guiding an air stream formed by the fan <b>16</b>. Further, about ten (10) screws are needed for fastening the fan housing, the housing <b>12</b>, the duct housing <b>17</b> and the housing cover <b>22</b> to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, the conventional ice maker has problems in that it is difficult to manage constituent parts and manufacturing costs are increased due to the large number of parts, and assembly workability is deteriorated due to a plurality of screwing operations for assembling the parts.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, the fan motor <b>15</b> constituting the conventional fan assembly <b>10</b> is an AC motor that has a relatively large volume and heavy weight. Moreover, since the fan housing <b>14</b> is provided in the fan assembly <b>10</b>, the entire weight of the fan assembly <b>10</b> is increased. Accordingly, considering the ice maker as a whole, the center of gravity of the ice maker is biased toward the fan assembly <b>10</b> and thus there is a problem in that the design of installation of the ice maker is complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, since openings of the inlet <b>18</b> and outlet <b>20</b> do not exit on a straight line in the conventional fan assembly <b>10</b>, the flow of cold air is not smooth relatively. That is, there is a problem in that a relatively large loss of the flow of the cold air which flows within the fan assembly <b>12</b> is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Meanwhile, the conventional ice maker is controlled such that ON/OFF operations of the fan are performed twice during one (1) cycle including the water-supplying operation, the ice-making operation, the ice-releasing operation and the operation for detecting the state where the ice storage container is fully filled with ice. That is, the ON/OFF operation of the fan is performed once during the process of releasing ice, and the ON/OFF operation of the fan is performed once again after the process of detecting the state where the ice storage container is fully filled with ice and the process of supplying water.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the conventional ice maker controlled as described above, there is a problem in that the ON/OFF operations of the fan are unnecessarily performed since the fan is operated twice during one cycle, thereby shortening the life of the fan.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, the present invention is conceived to solve the problems in the prior art. An object of the present invention is to provide a fan assembly having simplified constituent parts.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another object of the present invention is to provide an ice maker of which the center of gravity substantially coincides with the geometrical center thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A fan assembly <b>60</b> is mounted to a side of the main body <b>40</b> of the ice maker. The fan assembly <b>60</b> forcibly directs cold air within the refrigerator toward the ice-making tray <b>45</b> so that ice can be more rapidly made.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A housing <b>62</b> defines an external appearance of the fan assembly <b>60</b>. The housing <b>62</b> is constructed by coupling a first housing portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>and a second housing portion <b>62</b><i>b </i>to each other. The first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are located respectively at left and right sides with respect to the flow of the forcibly delivered cold air to construct the housing <b>62</b>. In order to couple the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>to each other, a fastening hole <b>62</b><i>h </i>is formed in a recess <b>62</b><i>h</i>&#x2032; indented toward to the interior of the first housing portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>at one end thereof, and a fastening rib <b>62</b><i>r </i>protrudes at a position in the second housing portion <b>62</b><i>b</i>, which corresponds to the position of the fastening hole. A fastening hole <b>62</b><i>h </i>corresponding to the fastening hole <b>62</b><i>h </i>is formed at the fastening rib. A catching rib <b>62</b><i>g </i>on which a housing cover <b>70</b> to be described later is hung is formed vertically along one end of the second housing portion <b>62</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Concavo-convex coupling portions <b>63</b> and <b>63</b>&#x2032; for provisional assembly of the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are formed at opposite positions in the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The concavo-convex coupling portions <b>63</b> and <b>63</b>&#x2032; are formed on the bottoms of upper surfaces and the tops of lower surfaces of the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Protruding portions of the concavo-convex coupling portions <b>63</b> and <b>63</b>&#x2032; extend toward the opposite ones of the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and recessed portions of the concavo-convex coupling portions <b>63</b>&#x2032; and <b>63</b> of the other ones of the housing portions <b>62</b><i>b </i>and <b>62</b><i>a </i>are formed to correspond to the protruding portions. These concavo-convex coupling portions <b>63</b> and <b>63</b>&#x2032; serve to allow the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>to be provisionally assembled and to be prevented from being moved relatively toward the main body <b>40</b> of the ice maker.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Partition plates <b>64</b> are provided in the interiors of the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b</i>, respectively. When the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are coupled to each other, the partition plates <b>64</b> partition the interiors of the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>to form a flow passage <b>64</b><i>f </i>through which cold air flows. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the flow passage <b>64</b><i>f </i>is formed such that its sectional flow area gradually decreases from an upstream side to a downstream side.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Mounting ribs <b>65</b> are formed on the partition plate <b>64</b> of the first housing portion <b>62</b><i>a</i>. The mounting ribs <b>65</b> are used for mounting a box fan unit <b>80</b> which will be described later. Fastening holes <b>65</b><i>h </i>are perforated in the mounting ribs <b>65</b>. Further, mounting ribs <b>65</b>&#x2032; for mounting the box fan unit <b>80</b> are formed at an inner lower end of the second housing portion <b>62</b><i>b</i>. The mounting ribs <b>65</b> and <b>65</b>&#x2032; are formed at positions corresponding to opposite corners of the box fan unit <b>80</b> and are in pairs to accommodate both ends of relevant external corners of the box fan unit <b>80</b>. Mounting holes <b>65</b> are also formed in the mounting ribs <b>65</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">An elongated half portion is formed at each of the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>to form a discharge duct <b>66</b> communicating with the flow passage <b>64</b><i>f</i>. That is, the discharge duct <b>66</b> is constructed through coupling of the both half portions formed at the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>and defines one flow passage in the housing. For reference, the concavo-convex combining parts <b>63</b> and <b>63</b>&#x2032; are formed even at the discharge duct <b>66</b>. An outlet <b>68</b> is formed at a distal end of the discharge duct <b>66</b>. The discharge duct <b>66</b> extends such that the outlet <b>68</b> is located at a position below a side of the ice-making tray <b>45</b>. Here, as well shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a bottom surface of the cold air flow passage <b>64</b><i>f </i>which is formed in the housing <b>62</b> is flush with a bottom surface of the discharge duct <b>66</b> to be in a plane. Further, the distal end of the discharge duct <b>66</b> is inclined upward toward the bottom of the ice-making tray <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A plurality of mounting hooks <b>69</b> are formed at the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>for mounting the housing <b>62</b> to the main body frame <b>41</b>. Since each mounting hook <b>69</b> has elasticity due to features of the shape and material thereof, the housing <b>62</b> is mounted to the main body frame <b>41</b>. The mounting hooks <b>69</b> are formed at upper side corners of the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>and portions thereof just above the discharge duct <b>66</b>. For reference, recesses (not shown) for accommodating the mounting hooks <b>69</b> are formed at corresponding positions in the main body frame <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The housing <b>62</b> is formed such that both ends thereof, that is, an end facing the main body frame <b>41</b> and the other end opposite thereto, are open. The housing cover <b>70</b> closes the other end opposite to the main body frame <b>41</b>. The housing cover <b>70</b> is formed with an inlet <b>72</b> for allowing the flow passage <b>64</b> to communicate with the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A fastening rib <b>74</b> is formed on a side of the housing cover <b>70</b> to correspond to the fastening rib <b>62</b><i>r </i>of the second housing portion <b>62</b><i>b</i>. The fastening rib <b>74</b> is a portion that is fastened together with the fastening hole <b>62</b><i>h </i>in the recess and the fastening hole <b>62</b><i>h </i>of the fastening rib <b>62</b><i>r </i>for coupling of the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>by means of a screw. A hanging rib <b>76</b> which is hung on the catching rib <b>62</b><i>g </i>of the second housing portion <b>62</b><i>b </i>is formed on the housing cover <b>70</b>. The hanging rib <b>76</b> is constructed of separate two portions to prevent interference of the hanging rib <b>76</b> with the partition plates <b>64</b>. The hanging rib <b>76</b> is formed to take the shape of &#x201c;&#x2510;&#x201d; and hung on the catching rib <b>62</b><i>g </i>so that the housing cover <b>70</b> and the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>can be assembled provisionally.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The box fan unit <b>80</b> is installed within the flow passage <b>64</b><i>f </i>formed in the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b</i>. The box fan unit <b>80</b> is installed in such a manner that relevant corners thereof are seated between the mounting ribs <b>65</b> and <b>65</b>&#x2032;, and is then fixed by means of additional screws that pass through and are fastened to the fastening holes <b>65</b><i>h</i>. The box fan unit <b>80</b> is provided with a fan that provides power for causing cold air to flow through the flow passage <b>64</b><i>f</i>. A motor for driving the fan is unitarily installed in the box fan unit <b>8</b>. The motor is a DC motor using a DC power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, the operation of the ice maker with the fan assembly according to the present invention constructed as above will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The process of assembling the fan assembly <b>60</b> in the ice maker of the present invention will be first described. The fan assembly <b>60</b> that has been assembled is mounted to the main body <b>40</b> of the ice maker. That is, the concavo-convex coupling portions <b>63</b> and <b>63</b>&#x2032; of the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are coupled to each other so that the first and second housing portions can be assembled provisionally. At this time, the provisional assembly is performed in a state that the box fan unit <b>80</b> is seated between the mounting ribs <b>65</b> and <b>65</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In such a state, the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are not moved relatively in a direction perpendicular to extending directions of the concavo-convex coupling portions <b>63</b> and <b>63</b>&#x2032;, and the housing portions are not arbitrarily separated from each other unless an external force greater than a predetermined value is applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In order to fix the box fan unit <b>80</b>, screws are fastened to the box fan unit <b>80</b> through the fastening holes <b>65</b><i>h </i>of the mounting ribs <b>65</b> and <b>65</b>&#x2032;. In this state, the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>have been coupled to each other by means of the screws and the box fan unit <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Then, the housing cover <b>70</b> is coupled to the housing <b>62</b>. At this time, the fastening rib <b>74</b> is seated in the recess <b>62</b><i>h</i>&#x2032; of the first housing portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>in a state where the hanging rib <b>76</b> is hung on the catching rib <b>62</b><i>g</i>. In such a state, the housing cover <b>70</b> closes one end face of the housing <b>62</b>, i.e. a face opposite to the other end face where the discharge duct <b>66</b> is formed. The provisional assembly of the housing cover <b>70</b> is completed by coupling the hanging rib <b>76</b> to the catching rib <b>62</b><i>g </i>and seating the fastening rib <b>74</b> in the recess <b>62</b><i>h</i>&#x2032;. At this time, the outside of the housing <b>62</b> and the flow passage <b>64</b><i>f </i>within the housing communicate with each other through the inlet <b>72</b> of the housing cover <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When a screw is fastened to the fastening rib <b>74</b>, the fastening hole <b>62</b><i>h </i>and the fastening hole <b>62</b><i>h </i>of the fastening rib <b>62</b><i>r </i>in such a state, the housing cover <b>70</b> is coupled to the housing <b>62</b>. Through such coupling, the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are coupled directly to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, when the first and second housing portions <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>and the housing cover <b>70</b> are completely assembled, the fan assembly <b>60</b> is obtained. Through the assembly process, the half portions for the discharge duct <b>60</b> provided in the first and second housing portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b </i>are coupled to each other to form the single discharge duct <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Next, the fan assembly <b>60</b> is mounted to the main body frame <b>41</b> of the main body <b>40</b> of the ice maker. At this time, the fan assembly <b>60</b> is mounted to the main body <b>40</b> of the ice maker by causing the mounting hooks <b>69</b> to be caught in the recesses formed on the first mounting frame portion <b>42</b> of the main body frame <b>41</b>. Parts including the control unit <b>54</b> provided on the mounting frame portions <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> are covered by mounting the fan assembly <b>60</b> to the main body <b>40</b> of the ice maker so that the parts cannot be viewed from the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Meanwhile, the ice maker <b>30</b> provided with the fan assembly <b>60</b> described above is mounted onto one side of the interior of the refrigerator by means of the fixing rings <b>41</b>&#x2032;. The operation of the ice maker <b>30</b> will be described below. Water is supplied to the ice-making tray <b>45</b>, and ice is made by cold air within the refrigerator. At this time, the cold air within the refrigerator is forcibly delivered and supplied to the bottom of the ice-making tray <b>45</b> by the fan assembly <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">That is, the box fan unit <b>80</b> is operated so that the cold air within the refrigerator is supplied to the cold air flow passage <b>64</b><i>f </i>through the inlet <b>72</b>. The cold air introduced into the cold air flow passage <b>64</b><i>f </i>passes through the box fan unit <b>80</b> and flows to the discharge duct <b>66</b>. The cold air that passed through the discharge duct <b>66</b> is supplied to the bottom of the ice-making tray <b>45</b> through the outlet <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Here, a configuration for controlling the ice maker according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The ice maker of the present invention is provided with a water-supplying valve driving unit <b>340</b> which is operated when water is supplied to the ice-making tray <b>45</b> to make ice. The water-supplying valve driving unit <b>340</b> supplies water to the ice-making tray <b>45</b> during a period of time for water supply that is monitored by the control unit <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A fan motor driving unit <b>330</b> is provided to drive the fan for forcibly supplying the cold air toward the ice-making tray <b>45</b> so as to facilitate the ice-making operation after supplying the water to the ice-making tray <b>45</b>. The fan motor driving unit <b>330</b> drives the fan under the control of the control unit <b>54</b>. The fan motor driving unit <b>330</b> is constructed such that electric power is applied to the fan motor installed within the box fan unit <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The ice maker of the present invention is provided with a temperature-detecting unit <b>300</b> which is installed at a side of the ice-making tray <b>45</b> to detect temperature as a basic signal for determining whether ice has been made. The temperature detected by the temperature-detecting unit <b>300</b> is transmitted to the control unit <b>54</b>. The control unit <b>54</b> checks whether a signal corresponding to the temperature detected by the temperature-detecting unit <b>300</b> has reached a predetermined value (value set for determination on a point of time when the process of making ice is completed), and performs control of the ice-releasing operation in response to the determination that the ice-making operation has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, the ice maker of the present invention is provided with a micro switch <b>310</b> that is constructed to perform ON/OFF operations in response to the operational state of the ice-detecting lever <b>48</b>. Operational signals of the micro switch <b>310</b> are input into the control unit <b>54</b>. The control unit <b>54</b> receives the signal transmitted from the micro switch <b>310</b> and then determines that the ice storage container is fully filled with ice.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Reference numeral <b>350</b> designates a motor driving unit. The motor driving unit is a unit for supplying power required for operating the ice-releasing lever <b>46</b> for releasing ice from the ice-making tray <b>45</b> and the ice-detecting lever <b>48</b> for detecting the amount of ice. The motor driving unit <b>350</b> is a unit for controlling the supply of electric power to the driving motor <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, in order to separate ice from the ice-making tray when the ice-releasing operation is performed, a heater <b>90</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is provided at a lower end of the ice-making tray <b>45</b>. The heater <b>90</b> is operated by a heater-operating unit <b>360</b> under the control of the control unit <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, the process of controlling the operation of the fan in the ice maker according to the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the process of controlling the fan in the ice maker according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the ice maker of the present invention, the fan is controlled to perform the ON/OFF operation of the fan only once during one cycle in which all of the water-supplying operation, the ice-making operation, the ice-releasing operation, and the operation for detecting the state where the ice storage container is fully filled with ice are performed once. Moreover, in the ice maker of the present invention, the fan is operated only when the ice-making operation is being performed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In a state where water is supplied to the ice-making tray <b>45</b>, the control unit <b>54</b> applies a signal to the fan motor driving unit <b>330</b> in order to drive the fan motor installed within the box fan unit <b>80</b> (step <b>200</b>). Due to the control in step <b>200</b>, the fan motor driving unit <b>330</b> allows electric power to be supplied to the fan motor, so that the fan motor within the box fan unit <b>80</b> can begin to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the fan motor begins to operate, the cold air within the refrigerator is supplied to the cold air flow passage <b>64</b><i>f </i>through the inlet <b>72</b>. The cold air introduced into the cold air flow passage <b>64</b><i>f </i>passes through the box fan unit <b>80</b> and flows toward the discharge duct <b>66</b>. The cold air that has passed through the discharge duct <b>66</b> is supplied to the bottom of the ice-making tray <b>45</b> via the outlet <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In such a way, the cold air is supplied rapidly to the ice-making tray <b>45</b> and water contained in the ice-making tray <b>45</b> is frozen. In the meantime, the control unit <b>54</b> controls the operation of the box fan unit <b>80</b> and simultaneously monitors temperature through the temperature-detecting unit <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The temperature-detecting unit <b>300</b> is provided at a side of the ice-making tray <b>45</b> and detects the temperature of the ice-making tray <b>45</b>. This is an operation for monitoring whether water contained in the ice-making tray <b>45</b> has been frozen completely. That is, when the water contained in the ice-making tray <b>45</b> has been frozen, the temperature of the ice-making tray falls below a certain temperature x. Accordingly, the control unit <b>54</b> checks whether the temperature detected by the temperature-detecting unit <b>300</b> falls below the certain value <u style="single">x</u> (step <b>203</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">When the condition of step <b>203</b> has been satisfied, the control unit <b>54</b> determines that the ice-making operation has been completed. Accordingly, the control unit determines that it is not necessary to supply cold air any longer. Thus, the control unit <b>54</b> controls the fan motor driving unit <b>330</b> to cause the operation of the fan unit <b>80</b> to be stopped (step <b>206</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">After the box fan unit <b>80</b> is stopped in step <b>206</b>, the control unit <b>54</b> controls the operation for releasing ice from the ice-making tray <b>45</b> (step <b>209</b>). The control unit <b>54</b> first supplies electric power to the heater <b>90</b> through the heater-driving unit <b>360</b> to operate the heater. Since the ice adheres to the ice-making tray <b>45</b> as a result of the ice-making operation, the heater <b>90</b> is operated to slightly melt the bottom of the ice.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Then, the control unit <b>54</b> drives the driving motor <b>52</b> through the motor-driving unit <b>350</b>. The driving motor <b>52</b> generates rotational force for rotating the ice-releasing lever <b>46</b>. The ice-releasing lever <b>46</b> pushes the ice in the ice-making tray <b>45</b> to the outside of the ice-making tray <b>45</b> while being rotated by means of the rotational force generated from the motor <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the ice-releasing operation in step <b>209</b> has been completed, the control unit <b>54</b> operates the water-supplying valve through the water-supplying valve driving unit <b>340</b> so that water can be supplied to the ice-making tray <b>45</b> (step <b>212</b>). Then, the control unit determines through the ice-detecting lever whether the amount of ice that has been already made reaches a full level state, (step <b>215</b>). Steps <b>212</b> and <b>215</b> are performed substantially at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When the amount of ice that has been already made has reached the full level state in step <b>215</b>, the ice-making operation is no longer performed. That is, the full level state represents a state where the ice storage container additionally provided below the ice-making tray <b>45</b> is fully filled with the ice. Accordingly, if ice is made continuously even when the full level state is detected, a space for storing ice in the container is lacked.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Therefore, until the full level state is released, step <b>215</b> is in a standby state in which any of the ice-making operation, the ice-releasing operation and the water-supplying operation is not performed. When the full level state is released because a user takes out ice from the container, the procedure is returned back to step <b>204</b> and thus the control unit <b>54</b> repeats the aforementioned operations.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">At this time, since water has been already supplied to the ice-making tray <b>45</b> in step <b>212</b>, the box fan unit <b>80</b> is operated again to perform the ice-making operation. When the ice-making operation has been completed, the ice-releasing operation is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the present invention described above, the box fan unit <b>80</b> is turned on/off only once during one cycle in which all of the ice-making operation, the ice-releasing operation, the water-supplying operation and the operation for detecting the full level state are performed once. Particularly, since the box fan unit <b>80</b> is turned on only when the ice-making operation is performed, it is possible to prevent the box fan unit <b>80</b> from being unnecessarily operated during other operations. Therefore, the present invention operates the fan assembly once during one cycle, thereby reducing unnecessary operations.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, in the embodiment of the present invention, when the ice maker is operated initially, it is necessary that a user supplies water to the ice-making tray <b>45</b> by himself/herself. This is because in the present invention, the water-supplying operation is performed after performing the ice-making operation and the ice-releasing operation. However, after the ice-making operation and the ice-releasing operation have been performed once, the water-supplying operation is automatically performed in step <b>212</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">According to the present invention described above, the number of parts constituting the fan assembly is relatively decreased, and the number of screws for fastening the parts is also minimized. In the embodiment illustrated in the figures, only three (3) screws are used to assemble the fan assembly and the fan assembly is mounted to the main body frame without an additional screw. Accordingly, there are advantages in that the number of the parts constituting the ice maker is decreased as a whole and assembly workability is greatly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Furthermore, in the ice maker of the present invention, since the number of parts constituting the fan assembly is decreased and a relatively light DC motor is used, the center of gravity of the ice maker is adjacent to the geometrical center thereof so that the design of a structure for mounting the ice maker to the interior of a refrigerator can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Next, a cold air stream formed within the fan assembly in the present invention is in the form of a straight line, so that cold air can be supplied rapidly and smoothly to the ice-making tray without flow loss.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the meantime, according to the method of controlling the ice maker, the fan is operated only when the ice-making operation is performed, and the control unit determines whether the operation of the fan will be performed again after checking ice release, water supply and the full level state of ice while maintaining the fan in a stopped state before the ice-releasing operation is performed. Accordingly, since the fan assembly is operated only once during one cycle to avoid unnecessary operations, there is an advantage in that the life of the fan can be prolonged.</p>

<?GOVINT description="Government Interest" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to demolition charges and more particularly to demolition charges capable of being initiated by a variety of standard military initiation systems or devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">(2) Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Demolition packages containing explosives have long been used in the field to remove obstacles and accomplish a variety of other military purposes. Many of these demolition packages are hastily put together expedients; made under stressful conditions and, consequently, the packages may have sensitive components in the demolition train that detonate inadvertently or the packages simply may not have enough or the right kind of explosives to do what is needed. Consequently, the traditional bag-like &#x201c;satchel charge&#x201d; was developed to fill this need. The bag-like satchel charges are primarily canvas backpacks containing blocks of explosive linked by detonating cord. These charges are bulky (20 lbs) and are not easily primed or employed without some preparation by the user. The charges also do not have a multi-primed initiation system to assure reliable initiation. Additionally, because these charges can contain their own detonating cord and sensitive boosters; the charges are susceptible to accidental initiation. The traditional satchel charges can only be placed directly on or near a target and are not capable of being mounted by magnets, on a tripod or with other support apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a continuing need exists for a military demolition charge having a rigid hollow case capable of being filled with a variety of explosives. The case should have and having ports, tubes and other receptacles containing magnets and/or for receiving a number of quickly installed blasting caps, detonators and a detonating cord to create a multi-primed initiation system for reliable and complete initiation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a military demolition charge capable of being reliably initiated by a variety of initiation systems or devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is still further object of the present invention to provide a more reliable demolition charge capable of being loaded with a variety of explosives and initiated by blasting caps, detonators and/or detonating cords.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is still further object of the present invention to provide a quickly deployable demolition charge having magnets and threaded receptacles for engaging different structures.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a safe demolition charge capable of being initiated by any of a plurality of blasting caps, detonators, and/or detonating cords installed just prior to a planned demolition.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is still further object of the present invention is to provide a plurality of quickly deployable demolition charges primed with a common detonating cord strung through them.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to attain the objects of the present invention, a demolition charge system is provided in which the system has a multi-primed initiation system for improved reliability and safety.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A rigid container is provided having interconnected rigid thin end walls, side walls, a base wall and a lid. The lid continuously fits onto the end and side walls to cover and contain an internal chamber. Each of the ends walls has a threaded opening longitudinally aligned with each other. An elongate hollow thin-walled plastic tube longitudinally extends through the internal chamber and has threaded ends engaging inner portions of the threaded openings to securely hold the tube in the container. At least one demolition initiator longitudinally would extend in the tube. In an alternate configuration and preferably used for smaller containers, two elongate hollow thin-walled tubes extending from corners of the container and integrating in the middle of the container may be used to contain the demolition initiators.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A main charge in the internal chamber is placed in close abutting intimate contact along the length of the tube(s) where the tube(s) extends through the chamber to assure demolition of the main charge. A continuous recessed strip portion having a continuous groove is provided to extend along a continuous rim of the end walls and the side walls.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A continuous lip portion along the outer edge of the lid is shaped with an inwardly extending continuous rim. The lip portion and the inwardly extending continuous rim of the lid are sized to be fitted onto the strip portion and a continuous groove of the side and end walls with sufficient force to compress and override the continuous strip portion and fit the continuous rim into the a continuous groove in a sealed interlocking engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The threaded openings have outer portions adapted to engage correspondingly shaped structure of a support structure to more advantageously locate the main charge with respect to a target. Elongate tubular receptacles are equi-distantly spaced apart around the periphery of the internal chamber. Each of the elongate tubular receptacles has an elongate cavity extending between inner surfaces of the base and the lid to contain a magnet disposed in each cavity.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an improved demolition charge system <b>10</b> of the present invention has a box-like container <b>11</b> made from a plastic material or other cost-effective material that creates a rigid structure suitable to house explosives, is relatively non-corrosive, and is preferably non-conductive to low magnitudes of electrical power and static electricity. Wood may be selected as well as most metals provided that they are properly treated to be sealed and resistant to the corrosive influences of the operating environment. The container <b>11</b> can be molded or extruded as an integral watertight rigid structure from the plastic material to have interconnected and relatively light-weight thin end walls <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, side walls <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, and base wall or base <b>16</b> of sufficient toughness and crush resistance to be serviceable for field operations.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A continuous recessed strip portion <b>17</b> having a continuous groove <b>18</b> extends along a continuous rim <b>11</b>A of the end walls <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> and the side walls <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A flat top wall, or removable lid <b>19</b> of the container <b>11</b> has a continuous lip portion <b>20</b> along an outer edge <b>11</b>B that is shaped with an inwardly extending continuous rim <b>21</b>. The lip portion <b>20</b> and the rim <b>21</b> are sized to be fitted onto the strip portion <b>17</b> and the continuous groove <b>18</b> with sufficient force to compress and override the strip portion <b>17</b> and to fit the continuous rim <b>21</b> into the groove <b>18</b> in a sealed and interlocking engagement. In other words, the rim <b>21</b> has sufficient resiliency and exerts sufficient inward bias to accommodate and ride-over the lip portion <b>20</b> and then snap into the groove <b>18</b> as the lid <b>19</b> is fitted onto the side walls <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and the end walls <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. The container <b>11</b> having the lid <b>19</b> in place, on the side walls <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and the end walls <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and the base <b>16</b>, covers and forms an internal chamber <b>22</b> that may contain, and preferable be filled with an explosive main charge (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Since different explosives create different explosive effects, the constituency of main charge can be suited to the task to be performed and the explosives available. Mixes of different explosives might be desirable or a smaller main charge in the chamber <b>22</b> may be needed. In this case, the required amount of the selected explosives can be measured out and placed in the chamber <b>22</b>, or if more is needed for a task, additional ones of the demolition charge system <b>10</b> can be stacked and simultaneously detonated. In either case, reliable demolition is assured because of the initiation of the present invention to be discussed further on below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The container <b>11</b> of the demolition charge system <b>10</b> has a number of elongate tubular receptacles <b>24</b> equi-distantly spaced apart around the periphery of the chamber <b>22</b>. The receptacles <b>24</b> can be integrally formed with the end walls <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, the side walls <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>, and the base <b>16</b>. The receptacles <b>24</b> each have an elongate hollow cylindrical-shaped cavity <b>25</b> that extends between the inside surfaces of the base <b>16</b> and the lid when the lid <b>19</b> is secured on the recessed strip portion <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A magnet <b>26</b> is placed in each elongated cavity <b>25</b>. Shorter receptacles <b>27</b> having magnets <b>26</b> in their shorter cylindrical cavities <b>28</b> can be located on the base <b>16</b> along the centerline to further assure magnetic securing of the demolition charge system <b>10</b> on an iron-based surface. All of the magnets <b>26</b> can magnetically hold the demolition charge system <b>10</b> on and against a steel, iron, or other ferrous target. The magnets <b>26</b> also allow for the quick attachment of a fragmentation plate accessory (not shown) whether or not the magnets engage or not engage a target.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Optionally, one or more of the receptacles <b>24</b> and <b>27</b> can have the magnets <b>26</b> removed. More explosives including auxiliary blasting caps or other detonators can be substituted in the cavities <b>25</b> and <b>28</b> to further assure demolition of a main charge. This option is more attractive when there is no need to anchor the demolition charge system <b>10</b> on ferrous targets.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The end walls <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> are provided with threaded fittings <b>29</b> having openings or apertures longitudinally aligned with each other and also extending through adjacent receptacles <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B. An elongate, hollow, thin-walled plastic initiation tube <b>31</b> extends through the chamber <b>22</b> approximate to the longitudinal centerline of the container <b>11</b> and through the center of the chamber <b>22</b> and where the main charge would be positioned. The initiation tube <b>31</b> has threaded ends engaging inner portions of the threaded fittings <b>29</b> to securely hold the tube in the container <b>11</b>. The initiation tube <b>31</b> may be a single piece, but optionally the tube may have aligned portions <b>31</b>A and <b>31</b>B joined by a coupling sleeve <b>31</b>C. The aligned portions <b>31</b>A and <b>31</b>B and coupling sleeve <b>31</b>C may be useful to aid mounting of tube <b>31</b> in the container <b>11</b>. In an alternate configuration and preferably used for smaller containers, two elongate hollow thin-walled initiation tubes <b>31</b> extending from the corners of the container and integrating in the middle of the container may be used to contain demolition initiators. The configuration of the initiation tubes <b>31</b> is similar to a cross when viewed from the top of the box and centralized within the volume of the container <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Irrespective of the exact configuration of the initiation tube <b>31</b>, the tube has a relatively large longitudinally extending internal duct <b>33</b> to receive a number of the demolition initiators for priming of the main charge. The demolition initiators can be individual ones of or can include combinations of: a detonating cord <b>34</b> of fifty grains per foot size, and/or 2.) blasting caps <b>35</b> that may be connected to appropriate cap-initiating means such as, electrically conductive wires or a standard igniting fuse and/or 3.) other standard military initiation devices <b>36</b> such as time-actuated, chemically-actuated, and/or remote radio signal-actuated detonators. These multi-primed combinations of demolition means increase the safety of operation by introducing redundancy and can create higher or more intense shock waves to further guarantee reliable demolition of the main charge.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The thin-walled initiation tube(s) <b>31</b> can be sized to have one or more of the detonating cords <b>34</b>, blasting caps <b>35</b>, and the other standard detonators <b>36</b> quickly installed by the user to reliably initiate the main charge in the chamber <b>22</b>. The main charge would be positioned in the chamber <b>22</b> is in close-abutting and intimate contact along the length of the initiation tube <b>31</b> where the tube extends through the chamber in order to assure demolition of the main charge. Reliable initiation is further enhanced because of the design of the initiation tube <b>31</b> extending through a main charge in the chamber <b>22</b> and the use, if necessary, of a thin-walled cylinder booster charge. The booster charge would be wrapped around the hollow initiation tube(s) <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Use of a mounting tripod (not shown) or other mounting support apparatus for raising the demolition charge system <b>10</b> above the ground and specifically locating the system in close proximity next to a building or other above-ground target might be required to increase the effectiveness of the demolition charge system. The demolition charge system <b>10</b> of the present invention can be appropriately located for such applications since outer portions of the threaded fittings <b>29</b> that are not engaged by threaded ends <b>32</b> of the hollow initiation tube <b>31</b> can be used to receive a projection or correspondingly threaded mounting stud (not shown) of a mounting tripod or other support apparatus. In other words, the outer portions of the threaded fittings <b>29</b> are adapted to engage a correspondingly shaped structure of different support structures to more advantageously locate the main charge with respect to an intended target. Accordingly, the demolition charge system <b>10</b> of the invention can be used with a greater degree of effectiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The demolition charge system <b>10</b> of the present invention is a needed improvement over the explosive expedients of the prior art. The amount and constituency of the main charge can be quickly tailored in the field if need be, or an appropriate number of demolition charge systems <b>10</b> can be quickly made beforehand for a demolition task. Since a particular size for the demolition charge system <b>10</b> can be &#x201c;standardized&#x201d; (at say about ten pounds, for example), a considerable inventory can be pre-made and personnel can be trained in their proper use. The container <b>11</b> can be made in a variety of different shapes instead of the box-like configuration referred to above so long as it encloses a chamber containing the correct amount of explosives.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The demolition charge system <b>10</b> can be primed with one or more of the detonating cords <b>34</b> so that the required number of demolition charge systems can be &#x201c;strung&#x201d; on the same line of the detonating cord and initiated at the same time. Without the longitudinally extending thin-walled initiation tube <b>31</b> of each demolition charge system <b>10</b> containing the common &#x201c;strung-through&#x201d; detonating cord <b>34</b>, each charge would otherwise need an individual detonator. Since detonators and handling detonators are known to be the most dangerous parts of a demolition system, the claimed demolition charge systems <b>10</b> having a common detonating cord <b>34</b> reduce or eliminate the need for multiple separate detonators and decrease the risks and hazards to users.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Since the demolition charge system <b>10</b> can be loaded with a variety of explosives, the main charge can be tailored for the job and use the materials at hand. The selected main charge may contain a booster that is less sensitive (safer) than previous charges, yet the main charge is sensitive enough to be initiated via the detonating cord <b>34</b> coextending in the longitudinally extending initiation tube <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As a further safety feature of the demolition charge system <b>10</b> of the invention, the system need not be shipped or stored with the detonating cord <b>34</b> built in order to make the system safer and less likely to detonate accidentally. Instead, the detonating cord <b>34</b> can be quickly inserted through the duct <b>33</b> of the initiator tube <b>31</b> of each demolition charge systems just prior to demolition in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Threaded openings <b>29</b> create a pair of ports on opposite ends of demolition charge system <b>10</b>. Accordingly, each demolition charge system <b>10</b> can be simultaneously mated to one or more detonators (detonating cord, blasting caps etc.) and onto a tripod or other mating projection on another support apparatus. The gives the user many options in the way the charge is used and makes using the charge easier than conventional designs. Optionally, cables could be strung through openings to provide for support and/or be used to slide or pull appropriate demolition initiators into the initiation tube <b>31</b> for immediate or later demolition.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Therefore, the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment, but rather construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the recitation of the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage of PCT/EP2004/004657 filed May 3, 2004 and based upon DE 103 21 796.7 filed May 14, 2003 under the International Convention.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a brake disk.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently tribologically highly resistant materials are increasingly used for modern high performance brake disks. Here for example metal-matrix-composites (MMC) or carbon fiber reinforced ceramics on the bases of silicon carbide can be utilized. For car racing, friction rings based on carbon fiber reinforced carbon (C/C) are preferably utilized. Suchlike materials necessitate the usage of different materials for the friction ring and the brake disk hub. Friction ring and brake disk hub together constitute the brake disk.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various proposals have already been disclosed for the connection between friction ring and brake disk hub. A commonly utilized connection between the friction ring and the brake disk hub is a conventional screw connection. An example for such a screw connection is disclosed in DE 94 22 141 U1. Another form of connection between friction ring and brake disk hub is the riveted joint, as disclosed in EP 872 659 A1.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Both aforementioned constructions have in common, that the friction ring as well as the brake disk hub feature ring lands, which are layered above each other concentrically, and are connected by a joining arrangement. Usually bores are featured in the ring lands through which the joining arrangement passes. The disadvantage of this construction is that during the transmission of the braking torque flexural stress is induced into the ring land of the friction ring. Such a flexural stress may cause fissures in the comparatively brittle ceramic friction ring. Therefore a huge design-engineering effort is necessary to prevent fissuring in the friction ring.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The objective of the invention is to create a brake disk with a separate friction ring and brake disk hub, in which the stresses which act upon the friction ring through the joining arrangement are reduced in comparison to the state of the art.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The bake disk according to the invention features a friction ring and a brake disk hub. Here the term brake disk hub is understood as a linking element in general, which constitutes the connection between the friction ring and the hub of the wheel. In the case that the friction ring is directly attached to the hub of the wheel, the wheel hub itself is regarded as the brake disk hub according to the invention. The friction ring is understood as the part of the brake disk which contacts the brake pads in a retarding engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The brake disk hub as well as the friction ring features a concentric ring land. Both ring lands feature a number of recesses. One joining arrangement passes through each of the recesses of the ring lands of the friction ring and the brake disk hub.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention is characterized by a support ring which is arranged such that it encloses the ring land of the friction ring together with the ring land of the brake disk hub in the manner of a sandwich. Additionally, a connecting pin of the joining arrangement is arranged such that it is supported in the recesses of the support ring which correspond with the recesses of the ring lands of the brake disk hub and the friction ring.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thereby each joining arrangement running through the recesses of the ring lands is supported by one recess of the support ring. The joining arrangements are in this manner connected to each other. The support or bearing through the support ring prevents the individual joining arrangement from inducing flexural stress onto the recesses of the ring land of the friction ring. Hence a revolving force acts onto each recess of the ring land of the friction ring from which a compression stress results in the direction of load transmission. Particularly in ceramic parts a compression stress causes much less fissures than flexural stress, which without the support ring according to the invention would act upon the ring land of the friction ring.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment of the invention connecting pins are shrunk into the recesses of the support ring. Hence the connecting pins are perpendicular to the support ring and run through the recesses of the ring lands of the friction ring and the brake disk hub, and are screwed tight on the side of the brake disk hub. For this a thread is provided on the connecting pin on one side of the brake disk hub. A nut sits on this thread of the connecting pin and is tightened so that the support ring is pushed against the ring land of the friction ring.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment of the invention the connecting pin features a bolt head and on its other end a thread by which it is screwed into the recess of the support ring.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The recesses of the brake disk hub can be open radially towards the outside. Thereby a radial expansion of the brake disk hub is made possible. This radial expansion of the brake disk hub can also be allowed for by a recesses in the form of a slotted hole.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention is particularly advantageous for a friction ring which consists of a fiber reinforced ceramic on the basis of silicon carbide. Such friction rings exhibit a high tribological strength, are exceptionally temperature resistant and, in comparison to other ceramics, are very damage tolerant due to their fiber reinforcement.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The brake disk <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a friction ring <b>4</b> and a brake disk hub <b>6</b>. The friction ring <b>4</b> in this embodiment is comprised of a fiber reinforced silicon carbide ceramic.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The friction ring <b>4</b> as well as the brake disk hub <b>6</b> feature ring lands <b>8</b> and <b>10</b>. The ring lands <b>8</b> and <b>10</b> in turn feature recesses <b>14</b>,<b>16</b> in the friction ring <b>4</b> and in the brake disk hub <b>6</b> respectively. These recesses <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are shown in the cross sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and they are not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the brake disk <b>2</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is also shown a support ring <b>18</b> which is arranged such that it encloses like a sandwich the ring land <b>8</b> of the friction ring <b>4</b> together with the ring land <b>10</b> of the brake disk hub <b>6</b>. Herein &#x201c;like a sandwich&#x201d; means that in an axial direction first the ring land <b>10</b> of the brake disk hub <b>6</b> and then the ring land <b>8</b> of the friction ring <b>4</b> and subsequently the support ring <b>18</b> occur. The ring lands <b>8</b> and <b>10</b> and the support ring <b>18</b> feature recesses <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>22</b>, which are arranged such that they form a continuous bore.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A joining arrangement <b>12</b> is routed through the recesses <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>22</b> (compare also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The joining arrangement <b>12</b> comprises of a connecting pin <b>20</b> and a nut <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The ring land <b>8</b> of the friction ring <b>4</b> exhibits slots <b>34</b> in the circumferential direction which point radially outwards and feature an end bore <b>36</b> on their outer end. The slots <b>34</b> are arranged such that they are each located equidistant between the recesses <b>14</b> in the ring land <b>8</b> of the friction ring <b>4</b>. The slots <b>34</b> interrupt the ring land <b>8</b>, which is advantageous in the case of expansion caused by thermal stress. The end bores <b>36</b> serve the prevention of notch stress on the radial ends of the slots <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> two embodiments of joining arrangements <b>12</b> are shown schematically. In the brake disk arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> the disk brake is not identical with the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Nevertheless the same reference numbers are used for parts with similar or the same function. The embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> features a friction ring <b>4</b> and a brake disk hub <b>6</b>. Both in turn feature an ring land <b>8</b> respectively which overlap each other. The ring lands <b>8</b> and <b>10</b> feature recesses <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> wherein the recesses <b>16</b> in the brake disk hub <b>4</b> are in the shape of a radial slot. This oblong recess <b>16</b> provides room for a radial expansion of the brake disk hub <b>6</b> at elevated temperatures, without inducing flexural stress in the friction ring <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It maybe useful to introduce a sliding block (not shown here) between the connecting pin <b>20</b> and the recess <b>16</b> which provides for a radial expansion between the joining arrangement <b>12</b> and the brake disk hub <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The connecting pin <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is arranged such that it is shrunk into a recess <b>22</b> of the support ring <b>18</b>. The shrinking is usually done by a heat treatment of the support ring <b>18</b>, in which the cold connecting pin <b>20</b> is inserted, wherein said connecting pin <b>20</b> constitutes a frictional connection with the support ring <b>18</b> after it has cooled down.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The connecting pin <b>20</b> perpendicularly extends through the recess <b>22</b> of the support ring <b>18</b>. The connecting pin <b>20</b> is guided through the recesses <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> of the ring lands <b>8</b> and <b>10</b>. On the end opposing the support ring <b>18</b> the connecting pin <b>20</b> features a thread <b>26</b>. A nut <b>24</b> sits on this thread <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The nut <b>24</b> is tightened against the ring land <b>10</b> of the brake disk hub <b>6</b> whereby the support ring <b>18</b> is compressed against the ring land <b>8</b> of the friction ring <b>4</b>. The frictional connection between support ring <b>18</b> and connecting pin <b>20</b> is sufficient to counteract a screw torque and to constitute a frictional connection between the ring lands <b>8</b> and <b>10</b> and herewith between the friction ring <b>4</b> and the brake disk hub <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An axial clearance between the friction ring <b>4</b> and the brake disk hub <b>6</b> may be necessary to provide for thermal expansion in the axial direction. For this, a resilient element may be utilized which is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Such a resilient element may be constituted by a disk spring washer between friction ring <b>4</b> and nut <b>24</b>. Further, it is possible to ensure a resilient effect through an (also not shown) intermediate element between the connecting pin <b>20</b> and the recess <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Another schematic illustration of the joining arrangement <b>12</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Here the connecting pin <b>20</b> features a bolt head <b>32</b> on one of its ends. On its other end the connecting pin <b>20</b> features a thread <b>28</b>. In this embodiment the connecting pin <b>20</b> is not shrunk into the support ring <b>18</b>, but it is screwed in. Other than that, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is equivalent to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 through 4</figref> show preferred embodiments, in which the joining arrangements are constituted by a screw or threaded connection. Fundamentally the advantageous effects of the support ring can be achieved through other joining arrangements. Therein e.g. a riveted connection or a combination of riveted connection and frictional connection, such as shrink fitting, can be utilized. It is also conceivable to use material connecting or adhesive bonds, e.g. welding or brazing.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-028416, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a vehicle sliding door opening and closing apparatus which enables the opening and closing of a sliding door based on the control of a door opening and closing control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A related vehicle sliding door opening and closing apparatus is configured such that a door opening and closing drive unit is caused to operate based on an opening operation instructed by a door opening and closing control switch so as to move the sliding door in an opening direction, and when the sliding door reaches a fully opened position, a full-opening latch unit provided on the sliding door is brought into engagement with a full-opening striker on the side of a vehicle body, whereby the sliding door is held at the fully-opened position, while, when the sliding door is hold at the fully-opened position, a drive unit having an electric motor is caused to operate so as to unfasten a latch of the full-opening latch unit before the door opening and closing drive unit is caused to operate based on a closing operation instructed by the door opening and closing control switch, and thereafter, the sliding door is caused to move in a closing direction (refer, for example, to JP-A-2002-276227).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, there have been proposed various types of half-opening stopping devices for stopping the sliding door at a predetermined half-opened position when the sliding door has reached the half-opened position in the event that a window glass provided in the sliding door in such a manner as to be opened and closed is in an opened state in order to avoid a risk that an object is trapped between part of a window opening and part of a door opening (refer, for example, to JP-UM-A-61-152682). In these half-opening stopping devices, when a window glass detecting sensor for detecting the opening and closing of the window glass detects that the window glass has been opened, a stopper member is caused to project into a moving locus of the sliding door by a drive unit (a solenoid) provided on the side of a vehicle body, whereby when the sliding door is opened to the predetermined half-opened position, the sliding door is brought into abutment with the stopper member so as to stop the sliding door at the half-opened position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the half-opening stopping device is applied to the door opening and closing apparatus, however, two drive units, one for unfastening the latch of the full-opening latch unit and the other for enabling the sliding door to be stopped at the half-opened position when the window glass is opened, are necessary, and therefore, since an increase in cost is called for, this is not economical.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the invention, there are provided the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">(a) According to the first aspect of the invention, since both the full-opening latch unit and the half-opening stopping unit can be operated with the single drive unit while obviating the necessity of addition of another drive unit for operating the half-opening stopping unit by linking the drive unit to the half-opening stopping unit in such a manner that the half-opening stopping unit can be displaced to the state where the half-opening stopping unit is brought into abutment with the half-opening striker when the drive unit is operated in the second direction, a reduction in costs can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">(b) According to the second aspect of the invention, in addition to the advantage provided by the first aspect of the invention, compatibility between convenience and safety can be realized by utilizing the door opening and closing drive unit.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">(c) According to the third aspect of the invention, the half-opening stopping unit has the half-opening stopper member which can move between the sunk position where the half-opening stopping unit is unable to be brought into abutment with the half-opening striker and the projecting position where the half-opening stopping unit is able to be brought into abutment with the half-opening striker, the pawl member which holds the half-opening stopper member at the projecting position by being brought into engagement with the half-opening stopper and enables the half-opening stopper to move to the sunk position by being disengaged therefrom and the spring which biases the half-opening stopper member to the sunk position, and the half-opening stopper member can move from the sunk position to the projecting position against the biasing force of the spring when the drive unit operates in the second direction, whereby the half-opening stopping unit can be moved to the sunk position and the projecting position to be held at the respective positions in a simple and ensured fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">(d) According to the fourth aspect of the invention, the pawl member of the half-opening stopping unit disengages from the half-opening stopper member in synchronism with the unfastening of the latch of the full-opening latch units which occurs when the drive unit operates in the first direction, whereby the latch of the full-opening latch unit can be unfastened by virtue of the operation of the drive unit in the second direction, and the half-opening stopper member can be moved from the projecting position to the sunk position.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">(e) According to the fifth aspect of the invention, when the sliding door lies between the fully-closed position and the half-opened position, by closing the window glass that had once been opened, the half-opening stopper member can be moved to the sunk position by the drive unit, and the sliding door can be moved to a position which has passed the half-opened position.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">(f) According to the sixth aspect of the invention, since there is no need to move the half-opening stopper member to the projecting position in an area between the half-opened position and the fully-opened position where there exists no risk that an object is trapped, an unnecessary movement of the half-opening stopper member can be eliminated. In addition, since the half-opening stopper member is brought into abutment with the half-opening striker in no case when the sliding door is closed, the sliding door can be closed smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">(g) According to the seventh aspect of the invention, it is possible to prevent the abrupt closing of the sliding door that would occur by gravity immediately after the sliding door has stopped at the half-opened position when the vehicle is stopped on a slope which inclines downwardly to the front thereof.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the invention will be described based on the accompanying drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view of a vehicle to which the invention is applied, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view which shows an internal structure of a sliding door. Note that in the following description, the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> denotes the front of the vehicle, whereas the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> denotes the rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A sliding door (<b>1</b>) of a vehicle is fixed to a side of a vehicle body (<b>2</b>) and is supported in such a manner as to move in a longitudinal direction along the side of the vehicle body (<b>2</b>) by upper, middle and lower longitudinally extending guide rails (<b>3</b>), (<b>4</b>), (<b>5</b>), so as to move manually or via a door opening and closing drive unit (<b>6</b>), which will be described later on, from a fully-closed position where the sliding door (<b>1</b>) closes a door opening (<b>7</b>) provided in the side of the vehicle body (<b>2</b>) to a fully-opened position which the sliding door (<b>1</b>) reaches when it has moved to its rearmost position along the vehicle body (<b>2</b>) while being moved slightly outboard from the side of the vehicle body (<b>2</b>) and vice versa. Note that guide rollers (<b>8</b>), (<b>9</b>), (<b>10</b>) are provided on the sliding door (<b>1</b>) at locations thereon which correspond to the respective guide rails (<b>3</b>), (<b>4</b>), (<b>5</b>) in such a manner as to fit in the guide rails (<b>3</b>), (<b>4</b>), (<b>5</b>) respectively, to roll therein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A window opening (<b>12</b>), which is to be opened and closed by a vertically movable window glass (<b>11</b>), is provided in an upper half part of the sliding door (<b>1</b>). The window glass (<b>11</b>) is adapted to be opened and closed by operating an electric window opening and closing device (<b>13</b>) accommodated within the sliding door (<b>1</b>) based on control of a control switch (not shown) provided in a passenger compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A window glass detecting sensor (<b>14</b>), which can detect opened and closed states of the window glass (<b>11</b>), is pivotally supported by a pivot shaft (<b>14</b><i>a</i>) at the rear of a front sash (<b>13</b><i>a</i>) of the window opening (<b>12</b>) which guides the window glass (<b>11</b>) in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The window glass detecting sensor (<b>14</b>) is held as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to thereby be electrically switched off and sends out a window glass closed signal when the window glass (<b>11</b>) is at a closed position, whereas when the window glass (<b>11</b>) descends to a predetermined position to thereby be in an opened state, the window glass detecting sensor (<b>14</b>) comes into abutment with a detecting member (<b>15</b>) fixed to a lower portion of the window glass (<b>11</b>) and rotates in a counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by a predetermined amount to thereby be electrically switched on, sending out a window glass opened signal,</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The door opening and closing drive unit (<b>6</b>) is accommodated within the vehicle body (<b>2</b>) and includes a motor (<b>61</b>) which can rotate forwards and backwards, a rotary drum (<b>63</b>) which can rotate forwards and backwards via a reduction gear (not shown) which reduces the rotational speed of the motor (<b>61</b>), a cable (<b>64</b>) which is wound around the rotary drum (<b>63</b>) in such a manner as to be taken up and fed out thereby, laid out along the middle guide rail (<b>4</b>) and is connected to a central portion of a rear end of the sliding door (<b>1</b>), and an electromagnetic clutch (<b>62</b>) (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) which is provided between the motor (<b>61</b>) and the sliding door (<b>1</b>) or, to be specific, on an operation force transmission path between an output side of the reduction gear and the rotary drum (<b>63</b>) so as to connect and disconnect the operation force transmission path, whereby when the electromagnetic clutch (<b>62</b>) connects the operation force transmission path based on control of a door opening and closing control switch (<b>44</b>) which constitutes a door opening and closing control unit provided near a driver's seat or any other location and the motor (<b>61</b>) rotates forwards or backwards, the sliding door (<b>1</b>) can be moved in an opening direction or a closing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Note that when the electromagnetic clutch (<b>62</b>) disconnects the operation force transmission path, the sliding door (<b>1</b>) can freely be opened and closed in a manual fashion. In addition, when the electromagnetic clutch (<b>62</b>) connects the operation force transmission path and the motor (<b>61</b>) is stopped rotating, the sliding door (<b>1</b>) can be stopped to be held at a desired position by virtue of a braking force of the reduction gear.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A full-closing latch unit (<b>16</b>) is provided at a rear end portion within the sliding door (<b>1</b>) which is adapted to be brought into engagement with and disengagement from a striker (not shown) secured to an appropriate location on an opening rear edge (<b>7</b><i>a</i>) of the door opening (<b>7</b>). This full-closing latch unit (<b>16</b>) holds the sliding door (<b>1</b>) at a fully-closed position by being brought into engagement with the striker, whereas the full-closing latch unit (<b>16</b>) enables the sliding door (<b>1</b>) to move in an opening direction by being brought into disengagement from the striker, The unfastening of a latch of the full-closing latch unit (<b>16</b>) is implemented by operating an external operating handle (<b>20</b>) and an internal operating handle (not shown) which constitute the door opening and closing control unit provided on the sliding door (<b>1</b>) and by means of an electric actuator (<b>21</b>) which constitutes a drive unit provided within the sliding door (<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Provided at a front lower end portion (for example, the lower guide rail (<b>5</b>)) of the siding door (<b>1</b>) are a full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) which can hold the sliding door (<b>1</b>) at the fully-opened position by being brought into engagement with a full-opening striker (<b>17</b>) (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) provided at a rear end portion of the lower guide rail (<b>5</b>) and a half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>) which can stop the sliding door (<b>1</b>) at a predetermined half-opened position (a position indicated by solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) when the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is opened to the half-opened position by being brought into abutment with a half-opening striker (<b>33</b>) (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Fig. 3</figref>) provided substantially at a longitudinal central portion of the guide rail (<b>5</b>) in the event that the window glass (<b>11</b>) is in the opened state.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view which shows the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>), the half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>) and the vicinity thereof, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref> are operation explanatory diagrams of the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) and the half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) has a base plate (<b>22</b>) which is fixed to the sliding door (<b>1</b>), a latch (<b>24</b>) which is pivotally secured to the base plate (<b>22</b>) by a pivot shaft (<b>23</b>) which extends vertically and is adapted to be brought into engagement with and disengagement from the full-opening striker (<b>17</b>), a pawl member (<b>26</b>) which is pivotally secured to the base plate (<b>22</b>) by a pivot shaft (<b>25</b>) which is oriented or extends vertically and a link lever (<b>27</b>) which is secured to the base plate (<b>22</b>) in such a manner as to pivot concentrically with the pawl member (<b>26</b>). Note that the latch (<b>24</b>) is biased by a spring (not shown) in an opening direction (in a counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 7</figref>), while the pawl member (<b>26</b>) is biased by a spring (not shown) in an engaging direction (a clockwise direction). In addition, the latch (<b>24</b>) is provided at such a height that it does not interfere with the half-opening striker (<b>33</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The latch (<b>24</b>) is able to rotate between a latching position where the latch (<b>24</b>) is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, brought into engagement with the full-opening striker (<b>17</b>) when the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is fully opened and an unlatching position where the latch (<b>24</b>) rotates, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref>, by a predetermined amount from the latching position towards the opening direction so as to be brought into disengagement from the full-opening striker (<b>17</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The link lever (<b>27</b>) is linked to the operating handle (<b>20</b>), which will be described later on, and the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) which constitutes the drive unit so as to rotate front a waiting position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref> and <b>7</b> to an operable position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The pawl member (<b>26</b>) is able to rotate between an engaging position where the pawl member (<b>26</b>) is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, brought into engagement with a step portion (<b>24</b><i>a</i>) provided on an outer circumference of the latch (<b>24</b>) and a releasing position where the pawl member (<b>26</b>) is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, brought into disengagement from the step portion (<b>24</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>) has a half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) which is pivotally secured to the base plate (<b>22</b>) by a pivot shaft (<b>28</b>) which extends vertically, a pawl member (<b>31</b>) which is pivotally secured by a pivot shaft (<b>30</b>) which extends vertically, and a spring (<b>32</b>) which biases the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) in a sinking direction (a clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) is able to rotate between a sunk position where the half-opening member (<b>29</b>) sinks, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>7</b>, into the base plate (<b>22</b>) so as not to be brought into abutment with the half-opening striker (<b>33</b>) and a projecting position where the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) rotates, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, by a predetermined amount from the sunk position towards the clockwise direction so as to project sideways from the base plate (<b>22</b>) to thereby be brought into abutment with the half-opening striker (<b>33</b>). The half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) is prevented from rotating forwards (the clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>) by being brought into abutment with a stopper portion (<b>22</b><i>a</i>) provided on the base plate (<b>22</b>) when at the projecting position.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The pawl member (<b>31</b>) is biased in an engaging direction (a clockwise direction) by a spring (not shown) and is able to rotate between an engaging position where the pawl member (<b>31</b>) is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>, brought into engagement with a step portion (<b>29</b><i>a</i>) provided on an outer circumference of the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) so as to hold the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) at the projecting position and a disengaging position where the pawl member (<b>31</b>) rotates, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, by a predetermined amount from the engaging position towards a counterclockwise direction so as be disengaged from the step portion (<b>29</b><i>a</i>). When the pawl member (<b>31</b>) rotates to the disengaging position, the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) rotates to the sunk position by virtue of the biasing force of the spring (<b>32</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">With the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) held at the projecting position, when the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is opened to the half-opened position, a rear edge of the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, brought into abutment with the half-opening striker (<b>33</b>), whereby the gliding door (<b>1</b>) is stopped at the half-opened position. In addition, with the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) held at the sunk position by virtue of the biasing force of the spring (<b>32</b>), since the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) is unable to be brought into abutment with the half-opening striker (<b>33</b>), the sliding door (<b>1</b>) can freely be opened and closed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Note that when the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is stopped at the half-opened position, an opening front edge (<b>12</b><i>a</i>) of the window opening (<b>12</b>) lies further forwards by a predetermined distance than the opening rear edge (<b>7</b><i>a</i>) of the door opening (<b>7</b>). Consequently, when the window glass (<b>11</b>) is opened, an object is trapped between the opening front edge (<b>12</b><i>a</i>) of the window opening (<b>12</b>) and the rear edge (<b>7</b><i>a</i>) of the door opening (<b>7</b>) in no case by stopping the sliding door (<b>1</b>) at the half-opened position.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An intermediate lever (<b>34</b>) is pivotally secured to the base plate (<b>22</b>) by a pivot shaft (<b>35</b>) which extends vertically between the pawl member (<b>26</b>) of the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) and the pawl member (<b>31</b>) of the half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>). The intermediate lever (<b>34</b>) rotates in the clockwise direction by a predetermined amount, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> when the pawl member (<b>26</b>) rotates from the engaging position to the disengaging position, whereby the pawl member (<b>31</b>) is caused to rotate from the engaging position to the disengaging position, and the pawl member (<b>31</b>) is caused to rotate from the engaging position to the disengaging position by virtue of the rotation of the intermediate lever (<b>34</b>). This allows the pawl member (<b>31</b>) of the half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>) to move to the disengaging position in synchronism with the unfastening of the latch of the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) (the movement of the pawl member (<b>26</b>) to the disengaging position).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The electric actuator (<b>21</b>), which makes up the drive unit, has a motor (<b>36</b>) (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) which is accommodated in a housing (<b>21</b><i>a</i>) and is able to rotate forwards and backwards, a primary output lever (<b>37</b>) which is able to rotate via a reduction gear by virtue of the rotation of the motor (<b>36</b>), a secondary output lever (<b>38</b>) connected to the link lever (<b>27</b>) of the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) and the full-closing latch unit (<b>16</b>) via cables (<b>40</b>) and (<b>42</b>), respectively, and a tertiary output lever (<b>39</b>) connected to the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) of the half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>) via a cable (<b>41</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The primary output lever (<b>37</b>) is normally biased to a neutral position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by means of a spring (not shown) which is incorporated in the reduction gear, and when the motor (<b>36</b>) stops rotating after the primary output lever (<b>37</b>) rotates in the clockwise direction from the neutral position due to the motor (<b>36</b>) rotating forwards or rotates in the counterclockwise direction from the neutral position due to the motor (<b>36</b>) rotating reversely or backwards, the primary output lever (<b>37</b>) is made to be restored to the neutral position by virtue of the biasing force of the spring.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The secondary output lever (<b>38</b>) rotates in a direction indicated by an arrow A (first direction) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in synchronism with the rotation of the output lever (<b>37</b>) in the counterclockwise direction, and the rotation of the secondary output lever (<b>38</b>) causes the link lever (<b>27</b>) to rotate from the waiting position to the operable position via the cable (<b>41</b>) and unfastens the latch of the full-closing latch unit (<b>16</b>) via the cable (<b>42</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the link lever (<b>2</b>) rotates to the operable position, as has been described above, the pawl member (<b>26</b>) of the full-opening latch unit (<b>16</b>) and the pawl member (<b>31</b>) of the half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>) rotate in the releasing directions. When the pawl member (<b>31</b>) rotates in the releasing direction, the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) is caused to rotate to the sunk position by virtue of the biasing force of the spring (<b>32</b>) when the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) is at the projecting position.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The tertiary output lever (<b>39</b>) rotates in a direction indicated by an arrow B (second direction) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as the output lever (<b>37</b>) rotates in the clockwise direction, and this rotation of the tertiary output lever (<b>39</b>) causes the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) to rotate via the cable (<b>41</b>) from the sunk position to the projecting position against the biasing force of the spring (<b>32</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) rotates to the projecting position, the pawl member (<b>31</b>) is brought into engagement with the step portion (<b>29</b><i>a</i>), whereby the half-opening stopper unit (<b>29</b>) is held at the projecting position.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a block diagram of a control circuit. The window glass detecting sensor (<b>14</b>), a door position detecting sensor (<b>43</b>), which will be described later on, and the door opening and closing control switch (<b>44</b>) which is provided near the driver's seat or at any other location are electrically connected to input ports of a control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) which constitutes a control unit made up of a microcomputer, and the motor (<b>61</b>) and the electromagnetic clutch (<b>62</b>) of the door opening and closing drive unit (<b>6</b>), the motor (<b>36</b>) of the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) and the window opening and closing unit (<b>13</b>) are electrically connected to output ports of the control circuit unit (<b>45</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Note that the window opening and closing unit (<b>13</b>) provided on the side of the sliding door (<b>1</b>), the motor (<b>36</b>) of the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) and the window glass detecting sensor (<b>14</b>) are normally electrically connected to a power supply (not shown) and the control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) which are provided on the side of the vehicle body (<b>2</b>) by an electric cable (not shown) provided to extend between the sliding door (<b>1</b>) and the vehicle body (<b>2</b>) in such a manner as to he extended and contracted therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The door position detecting sensor (<b>43</b>) is made up a rotary encoder (not shown) which detects the rotation of the rotary drum (<b>63</b>) which normally rotates in synchronism with the opening and closing movements of the sliding door (<b>1</b>) and sends out a pulse signal, which is a detection signal, to the control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) by detecting the rotation of the rotary drum (<b>63</b>). The control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) counts pulse signals sent out from the door position detecting sensor (<b>43</b>) and measures the position and traveling direction of the sliding door (<b>1</b>) at the time of reception of the signals.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The door opening and closing control switch (<b>44</b>) sends out to the control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) a sliding door opening operation signal when operated to open the sliding door (<b>1</b>) and a sliding door closing operation signal when operated to close the sliding door (<b>1</b>). The control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) controls such that the electromagnetic clutch (<b>62</b>) of the door opening and closing drive unit (<b>6</b>) is engaged and the motor (<b>61</b>) operates in a door opening direction based on the input thereinto of the sliding door opening operation signal and controls such that the electromagnetic clutch (<b>62</b>) is engaged and the motor (<b>61</b>) operates in a door closing direction based on the input thereinto of the sliding door closing operation signal.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When a window glass opened signal is inputted thereinto from the window glass detecting sensor (<b>14</b>), the control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) controls such that the motor (<b>36</b>) of the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) rotates reversely, whereby the tertiary output lever (<b>39</b>) rotates in the direction indicated by the arrow B to thereby cause the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) to rotate from the sunk position to the projecting position via the cable (<b>41</b>). In addition, when a window glass closed signal is inputted thereinto from the window glass detecting sensor (<b>14</b>), the control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) controls such that the motor (<b>36</b>) rotates forwards, whereby the secondary output lever (<b>38</b>) rotates in the direction indicated by the arrow A to thereby causes the pawl member (<b>31</b>) of the half-opening unit (<b>19</b>) to rotate to the disengaging position via the cable (<b>40</b>), the link lever (<b>27</b>), the pawl member (<b>26</b>) and the intermediate lever (<b>34</b>) so as to enable the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) to move from the projecting position to the sunk position.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, the function according to the embodiment of the invention will be described below.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(A) (When the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is held at the fully-closed position and the window glass (<b>11</b>) is closed)</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this state, the fall-closing latch unit (<b>16</b>) is in engagement with the striker, and as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the latch (<b>24</b>) of the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) is held at the releasing position, and the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) of the half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>) is held at the sunk position, respectively. Consequently, after the engagement of the full-closing latch unit (<b>16</b>) is released by operating the door opening and closing control switch (<b>44</b>) or the operating handle (<b>20</b>) so as to open the sliding door (<b>1</b>), the sliding door (<b>1</b>) can be caused to move pass the half-opened position to thereby reach the fully-opened position through the operation of the door opening and closing drive unit (<b>6</b>) or manually.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(B) (When the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is held at the fully-closed position and the window glass (<b>11</b>) is opened)</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the window glass detecting switch (<b>14</b>) detects that the window glass (<b>11</b>) has been opened, the control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) controls such that the motor (<b>36</b>) of the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) rotates reversely, whereby the tertiary output lever (<b>39</b>) rotates in the direction indicated by the arrow B, causing the half-opening stopper unit (<b>29</b>) to move from the sunk position to the projecting position against the biasing force of the spring (<b>32</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) has rotated to the projecting position, the pawl member (<b>31</b>) is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, brought into engagement with the step portion (<b>29</b><i>a</i>) of the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) to thereby hold the half-opening stopper unit (<b>29</b>) at the projecting position. Consequently, even in the event that the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is attempted to be operated to open by operating the door opening and closing control switch (<b>44</b>) to open the sliding door (<b>1</b>) or manually in this state, the half-opening stopper unit (<b>29</b>) is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, brought into abutment with the half-opening striker (<b>33</b>) at the half-opened position, whereby the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is stopped at the half-opened position.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Incidentally, for example, when the vehicle is stopped in a posture which inclines downwards towards the front thereof, in the event that the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is stopped at the half-opened position, there may be caused a risk that the sliding door (<b>1</b>) abruptly closes by gravity. In order to prevent the abrupt closure of the sliding door (<b>1</b>), in the embodiment, when the control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) measures the movement of the sliding door (<b>1</b>) in the closing direction based on pulse signals outputted by the sliding door position detecting sensor (<b>43</b>) after the sliding door (<b>1</b>) has stopped at the half-opened position, the control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) controls such that the electromagnetic clutch (<b>62</b>) is engaged while the motor (<b>61</b>) of the door opening and closing unit (<b>6</b>) is kept stopped so as to cause a braking force to be exerted against the movement of the sliding door (<b>1</b>) to thereby hold the sliding door (<b>1</b>) at the half-opened position.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, when the window glass (<b>11</b>) is closed after the sliding door (<b>1</b>) has stopped at the half-opened position, control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) controls based on a window glass closed signal from the window glass detecting sensor (<b>14</b>) such that the motor (<b>36</b>) of the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) rotates forwards, whereby the pawl member (<b>31</b>) of the half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>) moves, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to the releasing position via the cable (<b>40</b>), the link lever (<b>27</b>), the pawl member (<b>26</b>) of the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) and the intermediate lever (<b>34</b>) as the secondary output lever (<b>38</b>) rotates in the direction indicated by the arrow A, this causing the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) to move, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to the sunk position against the biasing force of the spring (<b>32</b>) to thereby be held thereat. As a result, the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is allowed to move to the opening direction after passing the half-opened position.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(C) (When the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is held at the fully-opened position and the window glass is in the closed state)</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this state, the latch (<b>24</b>) of the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in engagement with the full-opening striker (<b>17</b>) and the pawl member (<b>26</b>) is in engagement with the step portion (<b>24</b><i>a</i>) of the latch (<b>24</b>). In addition, the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) of the half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>) is held at the sunk position by the spring (<b>32</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the door opening and closing control switch (<b>44</b>) is operated to close the sliding door (<b>1</b>) in this state, the motor (<b>36</b>) of the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) rotates forwards, whereby the sliding door (<b>1</b>) can be caused to move in the closing direction through the operation of the door opening and closing drive unit (<b>6</b>) after the pawl member (<b>26</b>) of the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) is caused to move in the releasing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, when the sliding door (<b>1</b>) lies at the fully-opened position (and between the fully-opened position and the half-opened position), even in the event that the window glass detecting sensor (<b>14</b>) detects that the window glass (<b>11</b>) is opened, the control circuit unit (<b>45</b>) nullifies a window glass opened signal from the glass window detecting sensor (<b>14</b>). consequently, the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) moves to the projecting position in no case while being kept held at the sunk position, whereby since the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) collies against the half-opening striker (<b>33</b>) front the rear thereof in no case, when the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is operated to close, the sliding door (<b>1</b>) can be caused to move freely towards the fully-closed position after passing the half-opened position</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, since the fully-opened position (and the position between the fully-opened position and the half-opened position) is a position where there exists no risk that an object is trapped therein, there is no need to cause the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>) to move to the projecting position. Consequently, as has been described above, it is possible to eliminate useless movements of the half-opening stopper member (<b>29</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Note that while the embodiment of the invention has been described heretofore, it is possible to make various types of modifications and changes without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the following various types of modifications and changes to the embodiments can be made.
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0075">(i) Instead of being connected to the pawl member (<b>26</b>) of the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>), the secondary output lever (<b>38</b>) of the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) is connected to the pawl member (<b>31</b>) of the half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>). In this case, the latch of the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) is unfastened in synchronism with the movement of the pawl member (<b>31</b>) to the releasing position.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0076">(ii) The intermediate lever (<b>34</b>) is abandoned.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0077">(iii) The configuration of the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) is changed as appropriately.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0078">(iv) The electric actuator (<b>21</b>) is connected to the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>) and the half-opening stopping unit (<b>19</b>) via a distributing unit (<b>46</b>) (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which is made up of a plurality of levers and which can distribute the operating force of the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) to the respective units.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0079">(v) In addition to the full-closing latch unit (<b>16</b>) and the full-opening latch unit (<b>18</b>), a front full-closing latch unit (not shown) provided on a front side of the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is connected to the secondary output lever (<b>38</b>).</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0080">(vi) In place of or in addition to the door opening and closing control switch (<b>44</b>), the door opening and closing control unit is made up of a sensor which can detect the operation of the operating handle (<b>20</b>). In this case, when the operating handle (<b>20</b>) is operated, the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) is actuated.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0081">(vii) The invention is applied to a vehicle sliding door opening and closing apparatus which does not include the door opening and closing drive unit (<b>6</b>). In this case, only the electric actuator (<b>21</b>) is actuated based on control of the door opening and closing control unit, and the sliding door (<b>1</b>) is opened and closed manually.</li>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to boring tools and more particularly to so-called &#x201c;spade bits,&#x201d; which are typically used with a drill for drilling holes in wood.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Spade bits are widely used for boring holes between approximately &#xbc;&#x2033; and 11/2&#x2033; diameter in wood and similar soft materials, because they are fast, true cutting, resharpenable, and relatively inexpensive. Their name derives from the shape of the spadelike blade or cutter, in contrast to the spiral shape of augers and twist drills. The blade, which is usually forged integrally from the shank, is relatively thin and flat and may have a width several times the diameter of the shank.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One known spade bit is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,682,917. A partial cross-section of this drill bit is shown drilling a bore in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. This bit <b>11</b> includes a blade <b>3</b> shoulder flute <b>5</b> adjacent the cutting edge of each shoulder. The flute has a cross-sectional onfiguration having an inner surface portion <b>7</b> and an outer surface portion <b>9</b> where the outer portion and inner portion consist of planar surfaces that meet at an angle. The shoulder flutes preferably do not extend all the way to the outer sides of the blade but rather stop inwardly of the sides of the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The inventor of the present drill bit determined that because the surface portions <b>7</b> and <b>9</b> comprise substantially planar surfaces that meet at a relatively sharp angle, the approximate path of travel of chips generated by this bit is as shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Specifically the chips curl up face <b>9</b> until they strike face <b>7</b> at which point they are reflected at a relatively severe angle almost perpendicular to the direction of travel of the bit, represented by arrow C. The chips are trapped in the bore <b>13</b> where they are swirled around by the drill bit blade <b>3</b> as the drill bit rotates until the chips are eventually ejected from the bore.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has been determined that moving the chips within the bore <b>13</b> by blade <b>3</b> slows the drilling rate and requires energy. Thus, not only is the drilling rate slower than optimal, the amount of energy used to drill the bore is increased. The use of excess energy to drill the bore can present a significant issue because many drills are battery powered such that the need for additional energy adversely affects the charge life of the battery resulting in the need for more frequent battery charges.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is a need in the art for a bit that increases the drilling rate and that requires less power.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The drill bit of the invention comprises a cutting blade formed at one end of a shank. The cutting blade has a pair of cutting shoulders that extend inwardly from the outer sides of the blade toward the bit axis. A tip having converging sides that meet at a point extends from the shoulders. The cutting edge of each shoulder is beveled with respect to the plane of the face of the blade. A flute is provided on the leading portion of each blade face adjacent the cutting edges. Each flute is a smooth curve that creates an uninterrupted recess on each face of the blade that facilitates chip removal, increases the drill rate and lowers the power required to drill a hole. A non-stick coating may be applied to the blade to further facilitate chip removal.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring more particularly to the drawings the drill bit of the invention is shown generally at <b>1</b> and consists of a shaft <b>2</b> having a hex connection <b>4</b> formed at one end thereof for engaging a chuck of a drill such as an electric or battery operated hand tool. The hex connection <b>4</b> may be formed with a recess <b>6</b> to be engaged by the quick-coupling of the drill chuck as is known in the art. The shaft <b>2</b> is connected to a cutting blade <b>8</b> having a first cutting face <b>10</b> and a second cutting face <b>12</b> where the blade is connected to the shaft with a taper angle &#x3b1; of approximately 2&#xb0;. Specifically, each face of the blade <b>10</b>, tapers from the axis of rotation of the blade A-A approximately 1&#xb0; such that the angle between the faces is approximately 2&#xb0;. The 2&#xb0; taper provides a slightly thicker shaft thereby increasing the strength of the drill bit over conventional configurations. A hole <b>25</b> may be provided to hang the drill bit for storage. While the 2&#xb0; taper is one preferred embodiment, the faces may be made parallel to one another such that the taper angle is 0&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The blade <b>8</b> has a pair of shoulders <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> that form cutting edges <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>, respectively. The outer side edges <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of blade <b>8</b> are spaced from one another approximately the diameter of the desired hole. The side edges are formed with a taper such that the blade <b>8</b> is wider near the shoulders <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> than it is near the shaft <b>2</b> by approximately 0.01 inches to provide clearance to allow the blade to pass through the material being drilled. The outer side edges <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are also formed with a side bevel &#x3b2; of approximately 7&#xb0;-9&#xb0; to allow the blade to clear the hole being drilled as the blade rotates as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the cutting edges <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> are on the leading edges of the blade <b>8</b> as the blade rotates in the direction of arrow A. The cutting edges <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> are formed, in part, by beveling the shoulders as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to create an acute angle &#x3bc; between the shoulders and the plane of the face of the blade. In one embodiment bevel angle &#x3bc;is 12&#xb0; to 22&#xb0; with a preferred angle of 15&#xb0; to 18&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A tip <b>26</b>, having converging sides <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>, extends from between shoulders <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. The sides <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> of tip <b>26</b> meet at point <b>32</b>. In one embodiment a pyramid-type point is created where surfaces <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are formed in the tip such that the point is comprised of four surfaces meeting at a point. Tip <b>26</b> has cutting edges <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> formed at the leading edges thereof. Spurs <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> are formed at the ends of shoulders <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. Spurs <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> score and cut the periphery of the bore to create a clean cut line.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Adjacent to and forming part of each cutting edge <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> are flutes <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, respectively, that facilitate the removal of chips from the bore, increase the drilling rate and decrease the power required to drill the bore. The flutes <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> define a surface that has a smooth profile with no sharp corners or flat surfaces that impede chip flow out of the bore being drilled. In one embodiment the flutes extend approximately 0.45 inches from the cutting edge or at least one quarter of the length of the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Flutes <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> may be made identical such that specific reference is made to flute <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> where flute <b>50</b> is a curved surface formed of curves with two different radii. The first curved surface <b>54</b> is formed as a curved surface with a radius of curvature of r<sub>1 </sub>and extends from the cutting edge <b>18</b> to a point where the radius is substantially perpendicular to the surface <b>10</b> of the blade <b>8</b>. The first curved surface <b>54</b>, where it intersects shoulder <b>14</b>, defines cutting edge <b>18</b>. The smaller the radius of curvature r<sub>1 </sub>of this surface, the sharper the cutting edge <b>18</b>. In one embodiment the radius r<sub>1 </sub>is between 0.292 and 0.692 inches with a preferred radius of 0.492 inches. The second curved surface <b>56</b> is formed with a radius of curvature of r<sub>2 </sub>and extends from the end of the first curved surface to surface <b>10</b> of blade <b>8</b>. Radius r<sub>2 </sub>is, in one embodiment, twice radius r<sub>1 </sub>and is between 0.784 and 1.184 inches with a preferred radius of 0.984 inches. Curved surfaces <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> are arranged such that surface <b>54</b> is tangential to surface <b>56</b> such that the flute <b>50</b> is smooth with no pronounced surface interruptions.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The flutes <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are arranged such that they extend laterally from approximately the axis A-A of the blade <b>8</b> to and through the outer surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, respectively. Because the flutes extend to the edges of the blade, manufacture of the blade is simplified. Specifically, a basic blade form can be made such as by a stamping process where the width of the blade form exceeds the width of a range of finished blades. The blade form can then be trimmed to the desired width. This is to be compared to the situation where the flute terminates internally of the edge of the blade such that each finished blade width must be based on a blade form that is specifically manufactured to that width.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment the flutes <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> extend into the blade approximately half the thickness of the blade. While the flutes are shown as two curved surfaces having different radii of curvature, the flutes may be made of a curve having a constant radius of curvature. Moreover the flutes may be made of more than two surfaces having different radii of curvature. For example a third surface having a third smaller radius of curvature could be formed between surface <b>54</b> and cutting edge <b>18</b> to create a cutting edge having a sharper edge. In such an arrangement the third curved surface would be arranged tangential to surface <b>54</b>. Likewise an additional curve having a larger radius of curvature may be used that is arranged tangential to surface <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The operation of the drill bit of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> where drill bit <b>1</b> is shown drilling bore <b>60</b>. As cutting edges <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> engage the bottom of bore <b>60</b> chips are developed that flow in the direction of the arrows. Specifically the chips contact surface <b>52</b> and are projected substantially parallel to the direction of movement of drill bit <b>1</b> (represented by arrow D) and propelled out of bore <b>60</b>. Because flutes <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are substantially smooth and are not formed with angles or other surface protrusions, the chips can flow substantially parallel to the axis of the drill and are quickly ejected from the bore. Because the chips are quickly ejected from bore <b>60</b>, they are not swirled in the bore by blade <b>8</b>. As a result, more of the power used to rotate the blade is used for drilling, rather than being used to move the chips in the bore. Thus, the drill of the invention drills at a faster rate and uses less power. Because the blade uses less power, it can increase the charge life of a typical battery powered drill.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another embodiment of the drill bit of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and is similar to bit <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref>, where like reference numerals are used to identify like components in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The blade is coated with a non-stick coating <b>62</b> to further enhance the ability of the blade to eject chips from the bore being drilled. In one embodiment the flutes <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are covered with the non-stick coating. The coating may be a powdered coat paint that includes non-stick powder such as TEFLON&#xae;. The coating may be sprayed on or dipped. The coating may be a thermoplastic that is applied in powder form and then heated to melt onto the blade. Alternatively, the coating may be a thermal set powder that is applied in powder form and heated where the heat creates a chemical reaction that bonds the coating to the metal blade. While the non-stick coating is shown applied to the flutes, the coating may be applied to other portions of the blade including the entire blade <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Specific embodiments of an invention are disclosed herein. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the invention has other applications in other environments. Many embodiments are possible.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A free standing golf putter is provided and configured to contact a golf ball at a point above the center of the golf ball. The mass of the central portion of the putter is greater than the mass of the toe and heel of the putter. The putter is utilized to view and evaluate the slope of a green by placing the putter in an upright, free standing orientation, by stepping away from the putter with the putter intermediate the golfer and hole, and by viewing the green to either side of the putter shaft.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to the game of golf.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">More particularly, the invention relates to a golf putter.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One objective strived for during putting is to strike a golf ball so that the ball rolls from the putter face directly over the surface of the green and does not lift away from the surface of the green or, at worst, become airborne.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another objective sought during putting is to minimize movement of the putter head from a desired path of travel both during the back swing and follow through of the putter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A further objective desired during putting is to avoid disrupting a putting stroke by scuffing the bottom of the putter on the green.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Still another objective desired during putting is to accurately read the slope or &#x201c;break&#x201d; of the surface of a putting green.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Still a further, although lesser, objective during putting is to avoid inadvertently leaving a putter behind when moving on to play the next hole.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to provide an improved golf putter that would facilitate meeting most, if not all, of the foregoing delineated putting objectives.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is a principal object of the instant invention to provide an improved golf putter.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other objectives of the invention include providing an improved golf putter that promotes striking a ball so the ball maintains contact with and rolls over the surface of a green; that increases the stability of the putter head; that minimizes the likelihood the putter head will contact the surface of a green; that facilitates utilizing the putter to evaluate the slope of a green; and, that reduces the risk that the putter will inadvertently be left behind when a golfer moves on to play the next hole.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Briefly, in accordance with the invention, I provide an improved golf putter. The putter comprises a head having a center of gravity and comprising a pair of interconnected hollow cylindrical members having opposing ends and outer rounded ball contacting surfaces and shaped and dimensioned that the center of gravity is generally centrally located intermediate the ends; the outer rounded ball contacting surfaces contact a golf ball at a point above the center of the golf ball; and, the putter is free standing. The putter also includes a shaft having a proximate end connected to the head generally at the center of gravity, and a distal end including a handle.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment of the invention, I provide an improved method of viewing the slope of a putting green. The method comprises the steps of providing a putter with a shaft, and a head connected to the shaft and shaped and dimensioned such that the putter freely stands on the ground with the shaft extending upwardly from the head; setting the said putter on the green to free stand with the shaft extending upwardly from the head; and, viewing the shaft and the green from a position remote from the free standing putter.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Turning now to the drawings, which illustrate the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, and in which like reference characters correspond to similar elements throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> illustrate a putter including head <b>10</b> consisting of a pair of interconnected hollow cylindrically shaped members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. Member <b>11</b> includes an inner channel <b>16</b> passing therethrough from one end <b>20</b> to the other end <b>21</b> of member <b>11</b>. Channel <b>16</b> tapers inwardly from ends <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> in a generally conical fashion to a smaller diameter portion <b>18</b> that interconnects the conical portions of channel <b>16</b>. Similarly, channel <b>17</b> tapers inwardly from ends <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> of member <b>12</b> in a generally conical fashion to a smaller diameter portion <b>19</b> that interconnects the conical portions of channel <b>17</b>. Channels <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> can be shaped and dimensioned as desired as long as channels <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> function to produce more mass in the center of the putter head.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The production of greater mass at the center of the putter head is an important feature of the invention because it produces more inertia in the center of the putter head and tends to reduce the likelihood that the putter head will twist due to torque forces generated by the heel or toe of the putter head. The inner or central portion of the putter head, indicated by arrows B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, has mass that is greater than the combined mass of the outer portions, indicated by arrows A and C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, of the putter head. The length, indicated by arrows B, of the central portion of the putter head is up to 50% of the entire length of the putter head (where the entire length equals the sum of the lengths indicated by arrows A, B, C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or by arrow G in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the putter head, preferably is up to 40% of the entire length of the putter head, more preferably is up to 30% of the entire length of the putter head, and most preferably is up to 20% of the entire length of the putter head. For example:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0020">1. If the length of the central portion (indicated by arrows B) of the putter head is 40% of the entire length, then the mass of the central portion is greater than the mass in the remaining 60% of the length of the putter head, which remaining 60% is indicated by arrows A and C.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0021">2. If the length of the central portion of the putter head is 20% of the entire length, then the mass of the central portion is greater than the mass in the remaining 80% of the length of the putter head. The length of the putter head is, as indicated by arrows A to C, measured from the heel of the putter head to the toe of the putter head.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0022">3. If the central portion (indicated by arrow B) of the putter head is one inch long (20% of the total length) and the combined length of the remaining portions (indicated by arrows A and C) of the putter head is four inches (80% of the total length), then the mass, or weight, of the central portion of the putter head is greater than the mass, or weight, of the remaining portions of the putter head.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0023">And so on.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0024">Although the length of the putter head can vary as desired, the length of the putter head currently is at least three inches, preferably at least four inches, and most preferably at least five inches.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0025">The diameter of cylindrical members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is such that when the outer cylindrical surface <b>11</b>A contacts a golf ball, it preferably, although not necessarily, contacts the ball <b>30</b> at a point <b>32</b> that is slightly higher above the ground than is the center <b>31</b> of the golf ball. This produces a small downward force on the ball that tends to maintain the ball on the green and reduce the risk that the ball will be lifted off the green. This is an important feature of the invention because its facilitates a golfer controlling the path of travel of a golf ball on a putting green.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0026">The cylindrical outer surface <b>11</b>A, <b>12</b>A of each member <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> tends to produce more of a point contact with a golf ball than with a putter face that is flat. The point contact of a cylindrical outer surface <b>11</b>A, <b>12</b>A produces, for some golfers, a contact that feels &#x201c;cleaner&#x201d;. The incorporation of the hollows <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> behind the points <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> where the putter head <b>10</b> preferably contacts a golf ball also produces, for some golfers, a contact that feels &#x201c;cleaner&#x201d; or &#x201c;sharper&#x201d;. However, the hollows can also, when a golf ball is struck with head <b>10</b>, produce a sharp sound undesirable to a golfer. In order to maintain incorporation of critical hollow areas in the putter head, circular sound dampening panels <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> are, if desired, incorporated in hollows <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> behind the points <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> where the putter head <b>10</b> contacts a golf ball. One or more panels <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> can be incorporated at any desired location along each hollow <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, although the centralized location shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is presently preferred as appearing to be the most efficient at dampening sound produced when head <b>10</b> strikes a golf ball.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0027">The pair <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> of hollow cylindrical members is utilized and believed important because if only a single cylindrical member is utilized it is difficult to extend a hollow channel completely through the member because the distal end <b>14</b> of shaft <b>13</b> is connected to the center of the putter head. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, a single, larger diameter cylindrical member is utilized in place of members <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and includes a pair of hollow channels that extend through the larger diameter cylindrical members and pass to either side of distal end <b>14</b> embedded in the center of the large diameter cylindrical member. Members <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> need not be identical or symmetrical and can have outer surfaces that are, instead of being cylindrically shaped, elliptically or otherwise shaped as long as the outer ball contacting surfaces of the putter head are arcuate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0028">The cylindrical outer surface <b>11</b>A, <b>12</b>A of each member <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> also tends to produce a linear contact with a golf green, which minimizes the likelihood that the bottom of head <b>10</b> will scruff or catch on the surface of the green; and, in the event a surface <b>11</b>A, <b>12</b>A does contact the surface of the green, it is more likely that such contact will not significantly affect the putting stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0029">When putter head <b>10</b> is set down on a green in the orientation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the putter is free standing. The putter is free standing because it remains in the upright orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of its own accord. If a golfer releases his or her grip on the handle <b>15</b>, the putter will not, as will most or all putters, fall over such that the shaft <b>13</b> contacts the putting surface of a green. Instead, the putter remains in the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with shaft <b>13</b> extending upwardly away from head <b>10</b> and from the putting surface of the green, and, with the lower portions <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> of outer surface <b>11</b>A and <b>12</b>A contacting the surface of the green. Since the putter of the invention is free standing, it is more noticeable when left in a free standing orientation, which reduces the risk that the putter will be inadvertently left behind after the putter's owner finishes putting and moves on to the next hole on a golf course. In order for the putter to be free standing, the foot print of the head of the putter must be sufficiently wide (or the head must be appropriately shaped and dimensioned) and the head must have sufficient weight or have an appropriate weight distribution to prevent the shaft and head from tilting in the directions indicated by arrows L and M in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and to prevent the shaft <b>13</b> and head from tilting in the directions indicated by arrows J and K in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As the weight of shaft <b>13</b> decreases, the magnitude of the force that results from gravity acting on the handle and that tends to tip shaft <b>13</b> and the putter head in the direction of arrow K decreases. Similarly, as the angle of shaft <b>13</b> with respect to the ground approaches ninety degrees, the magnitude of the force that results from gravity acting on the handle and that tends to tip shaft <b>13</b> and the putter head in the direction of arrow K decreases. It is presently preferred that when the putter of the invention is being utilized and is addressing the ball in the manner illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, that shaft <b>13</b> be canted with respect to the ground and not be normal to the ground. Most conventional putters utilize a shaft <b>13</b> that is canted with respect to the ground and with respect to the putter head, as is the case of shaft <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0030">The proximate end <b>14</b> of shaft <b>13</b> is fixedly secured in aperture <b>40</b> of putter head <b>10</b>. Aperture <b>40</b> is preferably, but not necessarily, formed at the center of gravity, or mass, Y (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of putter head <b>10</b>. End <b>14</b> contributes to the mass at the center of the putter head <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0031">When a golfer is attempting to view the slope of a green, the golfer places the putter of the invention on the green in the free standing orientation with, for example, the longitudinal axis X of the putter pointed toward the hole (or pointed in some other desired direction on the green). The golfer then walks a selected distance away from the putter and hole such that the putter is between the golfer and the hole and is aligned with the hole. The golfer then looks toward the hole in the direction of arrow D or E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as the case may be, and views the surface of the green to either side of the putter shaft <b>13</b> to evaluate the slope, if any, of the surface of the green.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0032">Alternatively, the golfer places the putter in the free standing orientation with the longitudinal axis X of the putter tangential to the hole (or normal to a line extending from the putter head to the hole). The golfer then, again, walks a selected distance away from the puffer and hole such that the putter is between the golfer and hole and is aligned with the hole. The golfer then looks toward the hole in the direction of arrow F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and views the green surface to either side of the putter shaft <b>13</b> to evaluate the slope, if any, of the green surface.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority on Patent Application No. 2006-113460 filed in JAPAN on Apr. 17, 2006. The entire contents of this Japanese Patent Application are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a putter head.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally known putter heads include pin type and L-shaped heads, generally referred to. Some of these putter heads may not be accompanied by sufficient moment of inertia, and may not have an enough sweet area. Therefore, these putter heads may vary in directionality upon mishitting. Also, so-called mallet putter heads may often have greater depth of the center of gravity and be accompanied by greater moment of inertia than pin type and L-shaped heads. However, even in the case of the mallet heads, improvement of the directionality of the hit ball may not be necessarily satisfactory.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In attempts to improve directionality of the hit ball, putter heads having a head shape which had not been suggested conventionally (hereinafter, may be also referred to as &#x201c;head with changed shape&#x201d;) and having a large size have been proposed recently. This head with changed shape has a shape elongated in a face-to-back direction. This head with changed shape is also referred to as a modified mallet type. JP-A No. 2005-7172 discloses a putter head having an extremely great length in the face-to-back direction. JP-A No. 2003-210629 discloses a putter head having a weight member disposed at the posterior of the head. JP-A No. 2005-66249 discloses a putter head including a front half body made of a metal having a low specific gravity, and a rear half body made of a metal having a high specific gravity. Publication of United States Patent Application filed corresponding to JP-A No. 2005-7172 is US 2004/254028 A1. Publication of United States Patent Application filed corresponding to JP-A No. 2003-210629 is US 2002/0107086 A1. Publication of United States Patent Application filed corresponding to JP-A No. 2005-66249 is US 2005/0049078 A1 and US 2006/0128499 A1.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Due to the shape elongated in the face-to-back direction, the depth of the center of gravity is made greater, and a greater moment of inertia is achieved. However, when the head size is extremely large as in the head described in JP-A No, 2005-7172, difficulties associated with setting and swinging may be raised. Also, the heads made of different kinds of metals joined one another as in the case of the head described in JP-A Nos. 2003-210629 and 2005-66249 require higher production costs because they take a lot of time and effort to manufacture. In the head manufactured by joining the different kinds of metals, detachment may occur at the joint region during its use.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a putter head which can achieve both a great moment of inertia and ease in setting, and which can be easily manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, a head having three regions, i.e., an anterior region positioned on the facemost side, a posterior region positioned on the backmost side, and a joint region positioned between the anterior region and the posterior region, which are provided to divide the putter head equally in the face-to-back direction, is envisaged. Herein, the anterior region has an anterior thick part having a thickness of equal to or greater than 20 mm. The joint region has a thin part having a thickness of equal to or less than 7 mm. The posterior region has a posterior thick part having a thickness of greater than 7 mm. The joint region has a full-width part formed by making the full width of this joint region to correspond to the thin part. Provided that the length of the head in the face-to-back direction is A<b>1</b>, the length of the full-width part in the face-to-back direction is equal to or greater than (A<b>1</b>/6).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the length A<b>1</b> of the head in the face-to-back direction is equal to or greater than 60 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the entire joint region is the thin part.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, maximum thickness T<b>1</b> of the anterior region, maximum thickness T<b>2</b> of the joint region, and maximum thickness T<b>3</b> of the posterior region satisfy the relation: T<b>1</b>&#x3e;T<b>3</b>&#x3e;T<b>2</b>. Preferably, maximum width B<b>1</b> of the anterior region, maximum width B<b>3</b> of the joint region, and maximum width B<b>6</b> of the posterior region satisfy the relation: B<b>1</b>&#x3e;B<b>6</b>&#x3e;B<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the weight of the posterior region is greater than the weight of the joint region.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, the weight is likely to be concentrated in the anterior region and the posterior region. Therefore, the moment of inertia and the depth of the center of gravity can be increased without excessively enlarging the head. Furthermore, the moment of inertia and the depth of the center of gravity can be increased without combining different kinds of metals having different specific gravities.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The head <b>2</b> has a face part <b>10</b> including the face surface <b>4</b>, an intermediate part <b>14</b> having a thickness of equal to or less than 7 mm, and a back part <b>12</b> that is thicker than this intermediate part <b>14</b>.

By making the entirety of the joint region R to be the thin part <b>16</b>, weight distribution to the joint region R is lessened. Lessening of the weight distribution to the joint region R can enhance the weight distribution to the anterior region Z and the posterior region K. Consequently, the moment of inertia and the depth of the center of gravity of the head can be increased. In addition, due to the thinness of the thin part, vibration of the head can be suppressed because the thin part itself vibrates. In other words, the thin part has a vibration absorption property. Due to the thin part having a vibration absorption property, the feel at impact is improved.</p>

Upon the swing, a centrifugal force acts on the center of gravity of the head. Due to this centrifugal force, the head can incline so that the loft angle becomes great. This inclination is likely to be greater as the depth of the center of gravity is greater. In light of suppression of excessive increase in the depth of the center of gravity, and inhibition of excessive increase in the loft angle at impact, the maximum width B<b>6</b> of the posterior region is preferably equal to or less than 70 mm, more preferably equal to or less than 60 mm, and particularly preferably equal to or less than 50 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In light of improvement of the stability of the head in the stroke, and upgrading the directionality of the hit ball, the left-to-right moment of inertia of the head is preferably equal to or greater than 3000 (g&#xb7;cm<sup>2</sup>), more preferably equal to or greater than 3500 (g&#xb7;cm<sup>2</sup>), and particularly preferably equal to or greater than 4000 (g&#xb7;cm<sup>2</sup>). Also, taking into consideration of preferred range of the total head weight M, the left-to-right moment of inertia of the head is usually equal to or less than 6000 (g&#xb7;cm<sup>2</sup>). The left-to-right moment of inertia refers to a moment of inertia around an axis that passes the center of gravity of the head, and that is perpendicular to the toe-to-heel direction and is perpendicular to the face-to-back direction.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In light of increase in the depth of the center of gravity and broadening of the sweet area, the proportion of the weight M<b>3</b> of the posterior region to the total head weight M is preferably equal to or greater than 5.0%, more preferably equal to or greater than 7.0%, and particularly preferably equal to or greater than 10.0%. In light of suppression of excessive increase in the depth of the center of gravity, and inhibition of excessive increase in the loft angle at impact, the proportion of the weight M<b>3</b> of the posterior region to the total head weight M is preferably equal to or less than 30.0%, more preferably equal to or less than 25.0%, and particularly preferably equal to or less than 20%.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Hereinafter, advantages of the present invention will be explained by way of Examples, however, the present invention should not be construed as being limited based on the description of the Examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A head having a shape similar to that of the head <b>2</b> according to the aforementioned first embodiment was produced. With respect to the method of the manufacture, the process for producing the head main body was casting. The head main body refers to a part except for the face insert f in the head. The entirety of the head main body was integrally molded by casting. The material of the head main body was stainless (SUS304). The material of the face insert f was an aluminum alloy. The face insert f was adhered to the head main body by an adhesive. To the resulting head was attached a shaft and a grip to obtain a putter club according to Example 1.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A head and a putter club according to Example 2 were obtained in a similar manner to Example 1 except that the thickness of the intermediate part was partially increased to provide a region not being the thin part in a part of the joint region R, and that the specifications of the head were as shown in Table 1 below.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Examples 3, 4</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A head and a putter club according to Example 3 and Example 4 were obtained in a similar manner to Example 1 except that the specifications of the head were as shown in Table 1 below.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Comparative Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A head and a putter club according to Comparative Example 1 were obtained in a similar manner to Example 1 except that the thickness of the entire intermediate part was increased to allow the thin part to be absent, and that the specifications of the head were as shown in Table 1 below.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Examples A, B</heading>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A head and a putter club according to Example A and Example B were obtained in a similar manner to Example 1 except that the shape of the head was the same as that of the head <b>24</b> according to the second embodiment, and that the specifications of the head were as shown in Table 1 below.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Comparative Example A</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The shape of the head was similar to the head <b>24</b> according to the second embodiment except that the thickness of the entire intermediate part was increased to allow the thin part to be absent. In addition, specifications of the head were as shown in Table 1 below. A head and a putter club according to Comparative Example A were obtained in a similar manner to Example 1 except for these matters.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Evaluation 1: Rolling Distance</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Ten golf players performed putting on the green aiming at a target point situated four meters away. Each golf player performed the putting intending that the ball was stopped at the target point. Each golf player first practiced with 10 balls, and then the measurement was carried out on 10 balls following the practice. A straight line S drawn between the ball position upon hitting and the target point was defined as the target direction. On each hit ball, the distance in the targeted direction between the ball stop point and the target point ball was measured. In any of the case in which the ball stopped at a point passed over the target point, and the case in which the ball stopped before the target point, the measurement value of the distance should be a value of +(plus). Mean value on 10 balls was determined, and then final mean value was calculated by averaging the resulting mean values for 10 golf players. With respect to Examples 1 to 4 and Comparative Example 1, a value derived by indexing with the final mean value of Comparative Example 1 assumed to be 100 is shown in Table 1 below in terms of &#x201c;rolling distance&#x201d;. With respect to Examples A, B and Comparative Example A, a value derived by indexing with the final mean value of Comparative Example A assumed to be 100 is shown in Table 1 below in terms of &#x201c;rolling distance&#x201d;. Smaller index of the &#x201c;rolling distance&#x201d; suggests more excellent distance performance. As the index of the &#x201c;rolling distance&#x201d; is smaller, more favorable result is suggested.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Evaluation <b>2</b>: Rolling Direction</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In concurrence with the &#x201c;rolling distance&#x201d; test described above, a &#x201c;rolling direction&#x201d; test was carried out. The distance between the stop point of the ball and the line S was measured on each hit ball as described above. In either case in which the ball was deviated off to the right or to the left, the measurement value of the distance should be a value of + (plus). Mean value on 10 balls was determined, and then final mean value was calculated by averaging the resulting mean values for 10 golf players. With respect to Examples 1 to 4 and Comparative Example 1, a value derived by indexing with the final mean value of Comparative Example 1 assumed to be 100 is shown in Table 1 below in terms of &#x201c;rolling direction&#x201d;. With respect to Examples A, B and Comparative Example A, a value derived by indexing with the final mean value of Comparative Example A assumed to be 100 is shown in Table 1 below in terms of &#x201c;rolling direction&#x201d;. Smaller index of the &#x201c;rolling direction&#x201d; suggests more excellent directionality, with less deviation to the right or the left. As the index of the &#x201c;rolling direction&#x201d; is smaller, more favorable result is suggested.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a hybrid vehicle and a control method of the hybrid vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One proposed hybrid vehicle has an engine and a first motor connected via a planetary gear mechanism to a drive shaft coupled to an axle via a gear mechanism, and a second motor connected to the drive shaft, and starts the engine while canceling a torque as a reaction force acting on the drive shaft with the start of the engine using the second motor (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Gazette No. 2005-30281). In this proposed hybrid vehicle, the torque is output from the second motor in view of a cooling water temperature of the engine to inhibit torque shock in initial explosion at the start of the engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, in such a hybrid vehicle, a torque pulse based on friction of a piston of the engine or the viscosity of oil for lubricating the engine may act on a drive shaft to cause a backlash between gears in motoring the engine. In order to inhibit the backlash between the gears, starting the engine with the backlash between the gears being eliminated by a motor MG<b>2</b> is considered. The size of the torque pulse differs according to the state of the engine in motoring, and thus the state of the engine is desirably considered in eliminating the backlash.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A hybrid vehicle and a control method of the hybrid vehicle according to the present invention have an object to inhibit a backlash between gears at the start of an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">At least part of the above and the other related objects is attained by a hybrid vehicle and a control method of the hybrid vehicle of the invention having the configurations discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed to a hybrid vehicle. The hybrid vehicle includes: an internal combustion engine that can output power to a drive shaft coupled to an axle via a gear mechanism; a motoring unit that is connected to an output shaft of the internal combustion engine and the drive shaft, and motors the internal combustion engine with input and output of power to and from the drive shaft; a motor that can input and output of power to and from the drive shaft; an estimation module that estimates that motoring resistance, which is resistance of the internal combustion engine in monitoring the internal combustion engine, becomes predetermined resistance or higher; and a starting control module that controls, when a start command of the internal combustion engine is given, the internal combustion engine, the motoring unit, and the motor so that the internal combustion engine is started while meshing gears in the gear mechanism is pressed toward one side by a first torque when it is estimated by the estimation module that the motoring resistance becomes lower than the predetermined resistance, and so that the internal combustion engine is started while the meshing gears in the gear mechanism is pressed toward one side by a second torque larger than the first torque when it is estimated by the estimation module that the motoring resistance becomes the predetermined resistance or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the hybrid vehicle according to the present invention, when the start command of the internal combustion engine is given, the internal combustion engine, the motoring unit, and the motor are controlled so that the internal combustion engine is started while the meshing gears in the gear mechanism is pressed toward one side by the first torque when it is estimated that the motoring resistance that is the resistance of the internal combustion engine in monitoring the internal combustion engine becomes lower than the predetermined resistance, and the internal combustion engine, the motoring unit, and the motor are controlled so that the internal combustion engine is started while the meshing gears in the gear mechanism is pressed toward one side by the second torque larger than the first torque when it is estimated that the motoring resistance becomes the predetermined resistance or higher. This allows the internal combustion engine to be started with a backlash between the gears being eliminated even when the motoring resistance is relatively large. This can inhibit the backlash in the gear mechanism at the start of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The hybrid vehicle according to the present invention may include temperature measurement unit that measures the temperature of the internal combustion engine, and the estimation module may estimate that the motoring resistance becomes the predetermined resistance or higher when the measured temperature is lower than a predetermined temperature. This allows more proper estimation of the motoring resistance becoming the predetermined resistance or higher based on the temperature of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one preferable embodiment of the hybrid vehicle including temperature measurement unit of the invention, the hybrid vehicle further includes a stop time measurement unit that measures a stop time of the internal combustion engine. The estimation module estimates that the motoring resistance becomes the predetermined resistance or higher when the measured temperature is lower than a predetermined temperature and the measured stop time is a predetermined time or longer. In this case, the stop time measurement unit measures time since the last turning off of ignition as the stop time of said internal combustion engine. Also, the stop time measurement unit measures time since the last stop of said internal combustion engine as the stop time of said internal combustion engine. This allows more proper estimation of the motoring resistance becoming the predetermined resistance or higher based on the temperature and the stop time of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another preferable embodiment of the hybrid vehicle including temperature measurement unit of the invention, the hybrid vehicle further includes a start number measurement unit that measures the number of starts as the number of starts of the internal combustion engine after the ignition is turned on. The estimation module estimates that the resistance of the internal combustion engine at the start of the internal combustion engine becomes the predetermined resistance or higher when the measured temperature is lower than a predetermined temperature and the measured number of starts is smaller than the predetermined number. This allows more proper estimation of the motoring resistance becoming the predetermined resistance or higher based on the temperature and the number of starts of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The hybrid vehicle according to the present invention may include a securing unit that can secure the axle so as not to be rotated, and the starting control module may control the internal combustion engine, the motoring unit and the motor to start the internal combustion engine while the meshing gears in the gear mechanism is pressed toward one side by the first torque or the second torque when the start command of the internal combustion engine is given with the axle being secured by the securing unit. This can inhibit a backlash between the gears at the start of the internal combustion engine with the axle being secured by the securing unit. The state where the axle is secured by the securing unit includes the state where the axle is secured by meshing between the gears with an operation of a gearshift lever to a parking position or the state where the axle is secured with a brake operation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one preferable embodiment of the hybrid vehicle of the invention, the motoring unit is connected to the output shaft of the internal combustion engine and the drive shaft, and can output at least part of power from the internal combustion engine to the drive shaft with input and output of electric power and mechanical power.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention is also directed to a control method of a hybrid vehicle. The hybrid vehicle includes: an internal combustion engine that can output power to a drive shaft coupled to an axle via a gear mechanism; a motoring unit that is connected to an output shaft of the internal combustion engine and the drive shaft, and motors the internal combustion engine with input and output of power to and from the drive shaft; and a motor that can input and output of power to and from the drive shaft, the control method comprising the step of controlling, when a start command of said internal combustion engine is given, said internal combustion engine, said motoring unit, and said motor so that said internal combustion engine is started while meshing gears in said gear mechanism is pressed toward one side by a first torque when it is estimated that said motoring resistance as a resistance of said internal combustion engine in motoring said internal combustion engine becomes lower than the predetermined resistance, and so that said internal combustion engine is started while the meshing gears in said gear mechanism is pressed toward one side by a second torque larger than said first torque when it is estimated that the motoring resistance becomes said predetermined resistance or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the control method of the hybrid vehicle according to the present invention, when the start command of the internal combustion engine is given, the internal combustion engine, the motoring unit, and the motor are controlled so that the internal combustion engine is started while the meshing gears in the gear mechanism is pressed toward one side by the first torque when it is estimated that the motoring resistance that is the resistance of the internal combustion engine in monitoring the internal combustion engine becomes lower than the predetermined resistance, and the internal combustion engine, the motoring unit, and the motor are controlled so that the internal combustion engine is started while the meshing gears in the gear mechanism is pressed toward one side by the second torque larger than the first torque when it is estimated that the motoring resistance becomes the predetermined resistance or higher. This allows the internal combustion engine to be started with a backlash between the gears being eliminated even when the motoring resistance is relatively large. This can inhibit the backlash in the gear mechanism at the start of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one preferable embodiment of the control method of the hybrid vehicle of the invention, the control method further includes the step of performing the control while estimating that the motoring resistance becomes the predetermined resistance or higher when the temperature of the internal combustion engine is lower than a predetermined temperature. This allows more proper estimation of the motoring resistance becoming the predetermined resistance or higher based on the temperature of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another preferable embodiment of the control method of the hybrid vehicle of the invention, the control method includes the step of performing the control while estimating that said motoring resistance becomes said predetermined resistance or higher when the temperature of the internal combustion engine is lower than the predetermined temperature, and a stop time of the internal combustion engine is a predetermined time or longer. In this case, the stop time of the internal combustion engine is a time since the last turning off of ignition. Further, the stop time of the internal combustion engine is a time since the last stop of said internal combustion engine. This allows more proper estimation of the motoring resistance becoming the predetermined resistance or higher based on the temperature and the stop time of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another preferable embodiment of the control method of the hybrid vehicle of the invention, the control method further includes the step of performing the control while estimating that the resistance of the internal combustion engine at the start of the internal combustion engine becomes the predetermined resistance or higher when the temperature of the internal combustion engine is lower than the predetermined temperature and the number of starts as the number of starts of said internal combustion engine after the ignition is turned on is smaller than the predetermined number.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">One mode of carrying out the invention is discussed below as a preferred embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates the construction of a hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> with a power output apparatus mounted thereon in one embodiment of the invention. As illustrated, the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment includes an engine <b>22</b>, a three shaft-type power distribution integration mechanism <b>30</b> that is linked with a crankshaft <b>26</b> functioning as an output shaft of the engine <b>22</b> via a damper <b>28</b>, a motor MG<b>1</b> that is linked with the power distribution integration mechanism <b>30</b> and is capable of generating electric power, a reduction gear <b>35</b> that is attached to a ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>functioning as a drive shaft connected with the power distribution integration mechanism <b>30</b>, another motor MG<b>2</b> that is linked with the reduction gear <b>35</b>, and a hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> that controls the whole power output apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The engine <b>22</b> is an internal combustion engine that outputs power from a hydrocarbon-based fuel such as gasoline or gas oil, and subjected to operation control such as fuel injection control, ignition control, or intake air flow adjustment control by an engine electronic control unit (hereinafter referred to as an engine ECU) <b>24</b>. A crank position from a crank position sensor <b>23</b><i>a </i>that measures a crank position of a crankshaft <b>26</b> of the engine <b>22</b>, or a cooling water temperature Tw from a water temperature sensor <b>23</b><i>b </i>that measures a temperature of cooling water of the engine <b>22</b> are input in the engine ECU <b>24</b>. The engine ECU <b>24</b> communicates with a hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b>, controls the operation of the engine <b>22</b> according to control signals from the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b>, and outputs data on an operation state of the engine <b>22</b> to the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> as required.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The engine <b>22</b> is lubricated by a lubrication system <b>90</b>. The lubrication system <b>90</b> lubricates the engine <b>22</b> by wet sump in which oil stored in an oil pan <b>92</b> is supplied to machine parts of the engine <b>22</b> using an oil pump <b>94</b>. In such a wet sump lubrication system <b>90</b>, most of the oil supplied to the engine <b>22</b> generally drops by gravity and is stored in the oil pan <b>92</b>, and thus part of the crankshaft <b>26</b> is immersed in the oil, when the engine <b>22</b> is stopped for long hours.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The power distribution and integration mechanism <b>30</b> has a sun gear <b>31</b> that is an external gear, a ring gear <b>32</b> that is an internal gear and is arranged concentrically with the sun gear <b>31</b>, multiple pinion gears <b>33</b> that engage with the sun gear <b>31</b> and with the ring gear <b>32</b>, and a carrier <b>34</b> that holds the multiple pinion gears <b>33</b>, in such a manner as to allow free revolution thereof and free rotation thereof on the respective axes. Namely the power distribution and integration mechanism <b>30</b> is constructed as a planetary gear mechanism that allows for differential motions of the sun gear <b>31</b>, the ring gear <b>32</b>, and the carrier <b>34</b> as rotational elements. The carrier <b>34</b>, the sun gear <b>31</b>, and the ring gear <b>32</b> in the power distribution and integration mechanism <b>30</b> are respectively coupled with the crankshaft <b>26</b> of the engine <b>22</b>, the motor MG<b>1</b>, and the reduction gear <b>35</b> via ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a</i>. While the motor MG<b>1</b> functions as a generator, the power output from the engine <b>22</b> and input through the carrier <b>34</b> is distributed into the sun gear <b>31</b> and the ring gear <b>32</b> according to the gear ratio. While the motor MG<b>1</b> functions as a motor, on the other hand, the power output from the engine <b>22</b> and input through the carrier <b>34</b> is combined with the power output from the motor MG<b>1</b> and input through the sun gear <b>31</b> and the composite power is output to the ring gear <b>32</b>. The power output to the ring gear <b>32</b> is thus finally transmitted to the driving wheels <b>63</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>b </i>via the gear mechanism <b>60</b>, and the differential gear <b>62</b> from ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A parking lock mechanism <b>56</b> constituted by a parking gear <b>57</b> mounted to a final gear <b>60</b><i>a</i>, and a parking lock pole <b>58</b> that meshes with and locks the parking gear <b>57</b> to stop rotation thereof are mounted to the gear mechanism <b>60</b>. The parking lock pole <b>58</b> is operated by an unshown actuator driven and controlled by the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> into which an operation signal from other position to a parking position (a P range) of a gearshift lever <b>81</b> or an operation signal from the parking position to other position is input, and comes into or out of mesh with the parking gear <b>57</b> to lock and unlock parking. The final gear <b>60</b><i>a </i>is mechanically connected to the drive wheels <b>63</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>b</i>, and thus the parking lock mechanism <b>56</b> indirectly locks the drive wheels <b>63</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Both the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> are known synchronous motor generators that are driven as a generator and as a motor. The motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> transmit electric power to and from a battery <b>50</b> via inverters <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. Power lines <b>54</b> that connect the inverters <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> with the battery <b>50</b> are constructed as a positive electrode bus line and a negative electrode bus line shared by the inverters <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. This arrangement enables the electric power generated by one of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> to be consumed by the other motor. The battery <b>50</b> is charged with a surplus of the electric power generated by the motor MG<b>1</b> or MG<b>2</b> and is discharged to supplement an insufficiency of the electric power. When the power balance is attained between the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b>, the battery <b>50</b> is neither charged nor discharged. Operations of both the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> are controlled by a motor electronic control unit (hereafter referred to as motor ECU) <b>40</b>. The motor ECU <b>40</b> receives diverse signals required for controlling the operations of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b>, for example, signals from rotational position detection sensors <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> that detect the rotational positions of rotors in the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> and phase currents applied to the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> and measured by current sensors (not shown). The motor ECU <b>40</b> outputs switching control signals to the inverters <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. The motor ECU <b>40</b> communicates with the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> to control operations of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> in response to control signals transmitted from the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> while outputting data relating to the operating conditions of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> to the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> according to the requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The battery <b>50</b> is under control of a battery electronic control unit (hereafter referred to as battery ECU) <b>52</b>. The battery ECU <b>52</b> receives diverse signals required for control of the battery <b>50</b>, for example, an inter-terminal voltage measured by a voltage sensor (not shown) disposed between terminals of the battery <b>50</b>, a charge-discharge current measured by a current sensor (not shown) attached to the power line <b>54</b> connected with the output terminal of the battery <b>50</b>, and a battery temperature Tb measured by a temperature sensor <b>51</b> attached to the battery <b>50</b>. The battery ECU <b>52</b> outputs data relating to the state of the battery <b>50</b> to the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> via communication according to the requirements. The battery ECU <b>52</b> calculates a state of charge (SOC) of the battery <b>50</b>, based on the accumulated charge-discharge current measured by the current sensor, for control of the battery <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> is constructed as a microprocessor including a CPU <b>72</b>, a ROM <b>74</b> that stores processing programs, a RAM <b>76</b> that temporarily stores data, a timer <b>78</b> that counts time based on commands, and an unshown input-output port, and an unshown communication port. The hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> receives various inputs via the input port: an ignition signal from an ignition switch <b>80</b>, a gearshift position SP from a gearshift position sensor <b>82</b> that measures the current position of the gearshift lever <b>81</b>, an accelerator opening Acc from an accelerator pedal position sensor <b>84</b> that measures a depression amount of an accelerator pedal <b>83</b>, a brake pedal position BP from a brake pedal position sensor <b>86</b> that measures a depression amount of a brake pedal <b>85</b>, and a vehicle speed V from a vehicle speed sensor <b>88</b>. The hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> outputs a drive signal to an unshown actuator of brakes <b>65</b><i>a </i>and <b>65</b><i>b </i>that apply a braking force to the drive wheels <b>63</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>b </i>with a driver's is operation of a brake pedal <b>85</b>, or the like via an output port. The hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> communicates with the engine ECU <b>24</b>, the motor ECU <b>40</b>, and the battery ECU <b>52</b> via the communication port to transmit diverse control signals and data to and from the engine ECU <b>24</b>, the motor ECU <b>40</b>, and the battery ECU <b>52</b>, as mentioned previously. The hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> is operated by electric power supplied from an unshown auxiliary battery, and time can be counted by the timer <b>78</b> regardless of the on/off state of the ignition switch <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The description now regards the operations of the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> having the configuration discussed above, and more particularly the operations at the start of the engine <b>22</b> with the gearshift lever <b>81</b> being operated to the parking position (the P range). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart showing an example of a starting control routine executed by the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> according to the embodiment. This routine is executed when the start command of the engine <b>22</b> is given with the gearshift lever <b>81</b> being operated to the parking position.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the starting control routine is executed, the CPU <b>72</b> of the hybrid electronic control unit <b>70</b> first executes a processing of inputting data required for control such as the cooling water temperature Tw or a stop time t of the engine <b>22</b> (Step S<b>100</b>). The cooling water temperature Tw measured by the water temperature sensor <b>23</b><i>b </i>is input from the engine ECU <b>24</b> by communication. A stop time tst of the engine <b>22</b> is input by starting counting time with the timer <b>78</b> at the stop of the engine <b>22</b>, storing the value of the timer <b>78</b> when the start command of the engine <b>22</b> is given in a predetermined area of the RAM <b>76</b>, and reading the value.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Data is thus input, then the input cooling water temperature Tw of the engine <b>22</b> is compared with a threshold value Twref (Step S<b>110</b>), and a stop time tst of the engine <b>22</b> is compared with a threshold value tstref when the cooling water temperature Tw is lower than the threshold value Twref (Step S<b>120</b>). The threshold value Twref and the threshold value tstref are threshold values used for determining whether a relatively large torque pulse acts on a ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>as a drive shaft in motoring the engine <b>22</b>, the threshold value Twref can be determined according to the kind of the oil or the like used for lubricating the engine <b>22</b>, and the threshold value tstref can be determined by the kind of the oil or the characteristic of the engine <b>22</b>. Now, the start of the engine <b>22</b> will be considered. When the engine <b>22</b> is motored by the motor MG<b>1</b> to start the engine <b>22</b>, a torque pulse based on resistance (hereinafter referred to as motoring resistance) such as friction of a piston or the viscosity of the oil acts on the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>as the drive shaft. The viscosity of the oil tends to be relatively small when the cooling water temperature Tw is high, and relatively large when the cooling water temperature Tw is low. When the engine <b>22</b> is stopped for long hours, part of the crankshaft <b>26</b> is immersed in the oil stored in the oil pan <b>92</b> as described above. Thus, when the engine <b>22</b> is started in the state where the cooling water temperature Tw is low and the engine <b>22</b> is stopped for long hours, specifically, the state where part of the crankshaft <b>26</b> is immersed in the oil with high viscosity, the motoring resistance is increased and a relatively large torque pulse acts on the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The comparison between the cooling water temperature Tw and the threshold value Twref and the comparison between the stop time tst and the threshold value tstref in Steps S<b>110</b> and S<b>120</b> determine whether the motoring resistance is large.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the cooling water temperature Tw is the threshold value Twref or higher, or the cooling water temperature Tw is lower than the threshold value Twref and the stop time tst is lower than the threshold value tstref, it is determined that the motoring resistance is not very large, and a predetermined torque T<b>1</b> is set to a power-holding torque Tg (Step S<b>130</b>). On the other hand, when the cooling water temperature Tw is lower than the threshold value Twref and the stop time tst is the threshold value tstref or higher, it is determined that the motoring resistance is relatively large, and a predetermined torque T<b>2</b> larger than the predetermined torque T<b>1</b> is set to the power-holding torque Tg (Step S<b>140</b>). The predetermined torques T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> are set to be slightly larger than torques output by the torque pulse to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>as the drive shaft in motoring the engine <b>22</b> when the motoring resistance is small and large, respectively, and set as torques in the same direction as a torque for canceling a reaction torque output to the drive shaft with motoring of the engine <b>22</b> with the motor MG<b>1</b>. The power-holding torque Tg is thus set to set a power-holding torque Tg according to the motoring resistance (the predetermined torque T<b>1</b> when the motoring resistance is small, and the predetermined torque T<b>2</b> when the motoring resistance is large).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, the rotation speed Ne of the engine <b>22</b> calculated based on the crank position measured by the crank position sensor <b>23</b><i>a </i>is input from the engine ECU <b>24</b> by communication (Step S<b>150</b>), a torque Tcr for motoring the engine <b>22</b> is set in a torque command Tm<b>1</b>* of the motor MG<b>1</b> (Step S<b>160</b>), and the input rotation speed Ne is compared with the threshold value Nref (Step S<b>170</b>). The threshold value Nref is the rotation speed Ne of the engine <b>22</b> for starting the fuel injection control or the ignition control, and for example, set to 800 rpm or 1000 rpm. When the rotation speed Ne is lower than the threshold value Nref, it is determined that the rotation speed for starting the fuel injection control or the ignition control has not yet reached, and a torque command Tm<b>2</b>* of the motor MG<b>2</b> is set according to Equation (1) given below based on a torque for canceling a reaction torque output to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>as the drive shaft with the motoring of the engine <b>22</b>, and the power-holding torque Tg set in Steps S<b>130</b> and S<b>140</b> (Step S<b>190</b>). Equation (1) is a dynamic relational expression of the rotation elements of the power distribution and integration mechanism <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an alignment chart showing a dynamic relationship between the rotation speed of each rotation element of the power distribution and integration mechanism <b>30</b> and the torque at the start of the engine <b>22</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an S-axis on the left shows the rotation speed of the sun gear <b>31</b> that is the rotation speed Nm<b>1</b> of the motor MG<b>1</b>, a C-axis shows the rotation speed of the carrier <b>34</b> that is the rotation speed Ne of the engine <b>22</b>, and an R-axis shows the rotation speed Nr of the ring gear <b>32</b> obtained by dividing the rotation speed Nm<b>2</b> of the motor MG<b>2</b> by a gear ratio Gr of the reduction gear <b>35</b>. Equation (1) can be easily derived from the alignment chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The torque command Tm<b>2</b>* of the motor MG<b>2</b> is thus set to allow the engine <b>22</b> to be motored and started with a backlash in the gear mechanism <b>60</b> or the parking lock mechanism <b>56</b> being eliminated even when the cooling water temperature Tw is low and the stop time tst is long, specifically when the motoring resistance is large. This inhibits a backlash between the gears in the gear mechanism <b>60</b><i>a </i>or a backlash between the parking gear <b>57</b> and the parking lock pole <b>58</b> in the parking lock mechanism <b>56</b> at the start of the engine <b>22</b>. When the cooling water temperature Tw is high, or when the cooling water temperature Tw is low and the stop time tst is short, specifically when the motoring resistance is small, the backlash between the gears can be inhibited, and power consumption of the motor MG<b>2</b> can be inhibited.

</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the torque commands Tm<b>1</b>* and Tm<b>2</b>* of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> are set, the set torque commands Tm<b>1</b>* and Tm<b>2</b>* of the motors MG<b>1</b> and MG<b>2</b> are transmitted to the motor ECU <b>40</b> (Step S<b>200</b>). The motor ECU <b>40</b> having received the torque commands Tm<b>1</b>* and Tm<b>2</b>* controls switching of switching elements of the inverters <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> so that the motor MG<b>1</b> is driven by the torque command Tm<b>1</b>* and the motor MG<b>2</b> is driven by the torque command Tm<b>2</b>*. Then, it is determined whether the explosion of the engine <b>22</b> is completed (Step S<b>210</b>). Considering that the fuel injection control is not started, the explosion of the engine <b>22</b> is not completed, and the process returns to Step S<b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">On the other hand, when the rotation speed Ne of the engine <b>22</b> is the threshold value Nref or higher in Step S<b>170</b>, the start command of the fuel injection control or the ignition control is given to the engine ECU<b>24</b> (Step S<b>180</b>), and the processings of Step S<b>190</b> and thereafter are executed. The engine ECU<b>24</b> having received the command starts an operation control of the engine <b>22</b> such as the fuel injection control or the ignition control. Then, when it is determined in Step S<b>210</b> that the explosion of the engine <b>22</b> is completed, the starting control routine is finished.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment as described above, when the start command of the engine <b>22</b> is given with the gearshift lever <b>81</b> being operated to the parking position, the motor MG<b>2</b> is driven and controlled so that the sum of the power-holding torque Tg of the predetermined torque T<b>1</b> and the torque for canceling the reaction torque acting on the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a </i>as the drive shaft with motoring of the engine <b>22</b> is output from the motor MG<b>2</b> when the cooling water temperature Tw is the threshold value Twref or higher, or when the cooling water temperature Tw is lower than the threshold value Twref and the stop time tst is shorter than the threshold value tstref, and the motor MG<b>2</b> is driven and controlled so that the sum of the power-holding torque Tg of the predetermined torque T<b>2</b> larger than the predetermined torque T<b>1</b> and the torque for canceling the reaction torque is output from the motor MG<b>2</b> when the cooling water temperature Tw is lower than the threshold value Twref and the stop time tst is the threshold value tstref or higher. This allows the engine <b>22</b> to be motored and started with the backlash in the gear mechanism <b>60</b> or the parking lock mechanism <b>56</b> being eliminated even when the motoring resistance is large. This inhibits the backlash in the gear mechanism <b>60</b> and the parking lock mechanism <b>56</b> at the start of the engine <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment, the operations have been described of starting the engine <b>22</b> with the gearshift lever <b>81</b> being operated to the parking position, but the engine <b>22</b> may be started similarly to the embodiment even when, for example, the gearshift lever <b>81</b> is operated to a drive position or the like and the brake pedal <b>85</b> is depressed, as long as the drive wheels <b>63</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>b </i>are locked. In this case, the backlash between the gears in the gear mechanism <b>60</b> may be inhibited at the start of the engine <b>22</b>. When the gearshift position SP is operated to the drive position or the like and the vehicle is running, the engine <b>22</b> may be started further in view of a torque demand Tr* required for the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment, the power-holding torque Tg is set as the torque in the same direction as the torque for canceling the reaction torque output to the drive shaft with motoring of the engine <b>22</b> by the motor MG<b>1</b>, but may be set in a different direction.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment, the power-holding torque Tg is set based on the cooling water temperature Tw and the stop time tst of the engine <b>22</b>, but the power-holding torque Tg may be set based on the cooling water temperature Tw only regardless of the stop time tst, specifically, regardless of whether part of the crankshaft <b>26</b> of the engine <b>22</b> is immersed in the oil stored in the oil pan <b>92</b>. In this case, the predetermined torque T<b>1</b> may be set to the power-holding torque Tg when the cooling water temperature Tw is the threshold value Twref or higher, and the predetermined torque T<b>2</b> may be set to the power-holding torque Tg when the cooling water temperature Tw is lower than the threshold value Twref.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment, the cooling water temperature Tw is used as the temperature of the engine <b>22</b>, but instead of the cooling water temperature Tw, for example, the temperature of oil Toil or the viscosity of the oil &#x3b7;oil may be used. In use of the viscosity of the oil &#x3b7;oil, the predetermined torque T<b>1</b> maybe set to the power-holding torque Tg when the viscosity of the oil soil is a threshold value &#x3b7;oilref or lower, or the viscosity of the oil &#x3b7;oil is higher than the threshold value &#x3b7;oilref and the stop time tst of the engine <b>22</b> is shorter than the threshold value tstref, and the predetermined torque T<b>2</b> maybe set to the power-holding torque Tg when the viscosity of the oil &#x3b7;oil is higher than the threshold value Toilref and the stop time tst is the threshold value tstref or longer.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment, the stop time tst of the engine <b>22</b> is the time between when the engine <b>22</b> is stopped and when the start command of the engine <b>22</b> is given, but may be time between when the ignition switch <b>80</b> is turned off and when the start command of the engine <b>22</b> is given after the ignition switch <b>80</b> is next turned on, time between when the engine <b>22</b> is stopped and the start of the engine is completed based on the time between when the engine <b>22</b> is stopped and when the start command of the engine <b>22</b> is given and the time required for starting the engine <b>22</b>, or time between when the ignition switch <b>80</b> is turned off and when the start of the engine <b>22</b> is completed based on the time between when the ignition switch <b>80</b> is turned off and when the start command of the engine <b>22</b> is given after the ignition switch <b>80</b> is next turned on, and the time required for starting the engine <b>22</b>. Instead of the stop time tst, the power-holding torque Tg may be set based on the number of starts Nst as the number of starts of the engine <b>22</b> after the ignition switch <b>80</b> is turned on. In this case, the predetermined torque Ti may be set to the power-holding torque Tg when the cooling water temperature Tw is the threshold value Twref or higher, or the cooling water temperature Tw is lower than the threshold value Twref and the number of starts Nst is a threshold value Nstref or larger, and the predetermined torque T<b>2</b> may be set to the power-holding torque Tg when the cooling water temperature Tw is lower than the threshold value Twref and the number of starts Nst is smaller than the threshold value Nstref.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment, the predetermined torque T<b>2</b> larger than the predetermined torque T<b>1</b> is set to the power-holding torque Tg when the cooling water temperature Tw is lower than the threshold value Twref and the stop time tst is the threshold value tstref or longer, but a torque set to be increased with decreasing cooling water temperature Tw, or a torque set to be increased with increasing stop time tst, or the like may be set to the power-holding torque Tg as long as the torque is larger than the predetermined torque T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment, the predetermined torque T<b>1</b> is set to the power-holding torque Tg both when the cooling water temperature Tw is the threshold value Twref or higher and when the cooling water temperature Tw is lower than the threshold value Twref and the stop time tst is shorter than the threshold value tstref, but different torques may be set to the power-holding torque T<b>1</b>. For example, the predetermined torque T<b>1</b> may be set to the power-holding torque Tg when the cooling water temperature Tw is lower than the threshold value Twref and the stop time tst is shorter than the threshold value tstref, and a predetermined torque T<b>3</b> smaller than the predetermined torque T<b>1</b> may be set to the power-holding torque Tg when the cooling water temperature Tw is the threshold value Twref or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the hybrid vehicle <b>20</b> of the embodiment, the power of the motor MG<b>2</b> is subjected to gear change by the reduction gear <b>35</b> and is output to the ring gear shaft <b>32</b><i>a</i>.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a molding material, a method of manufacturing a molded body, a method of manufacturing a sintered body, a molding material, a molded body and a sintered body that can be utilized for ceramics or powder metallurgy.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art Statement</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aqueous injection molding technique using agar has been known in the fields of ceramic powder molding and powder metallurgy. Particularly, in the injection molding method of ceramic powder, it has been known to mold a ceramic powder by using a binder constituted with water and agar. For example, in Japanese Patent No. 2604592 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,734,237), a basic patent in the relevant field, a metal powder or ceramic powder, an agaroid gel-forming material and water are mixed, and the mixture is heated to a temperature exceeding the gel point of the agaroid gel-forming material. The mixture is then molded at a temperature lower than the gel point thereby obtaining a molded body comprising the ceramic powder or metal powder. For example, an aqueous agar solution is admixed to a mixture of an alumina powder and deionized water, the mixture is mixed under heating at 77&#xb0; C. and injection molded, and the resultant molded body is sintered at 1600&#xb0; C. Further, Japanese Patent No. 3105225 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 748,151: PCT/US92/06799) also discloses a similar manufacturing method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present inventors have made a study, based on the patents described above, for obtaining a molded body of a complicate shape and its sintered body by the injection molding method. In the course of the study, it was observed that scattering was caused in the strength of the sintered body or the strength of the sintered body was lowered depending on the conditions. When the sintered body showing a low strength was analyzed and studied, it was found that lowering in the relative density was extremely small. Further, in the relevant field of the art using agar and water as the binder, the amount of agar is extremely small compared with those of conventional resin binders or wax binders. In addition, in the course of elevating the temperature of the molded body, since agar is easily released together with water, it is considered that no special degreasing step is required. That is, in the technique of using agar and water as the binder, it would be unlikely that remarkable lowering of the strength in the sintered body is caused depending on mixing, molding and degreasing conditions, and the cause therefore was unknown. Since ceramics are brittle, it is desirable to increase the strength in view of avoiding the risk leading to fracture.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of this invention is to improve the strength of a sintered body upon manufacturing of the sintered body from a molding powder by using a gel-forming material as a binder.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, another object of this invention is to improve the strength of a sintered body and suppress scattering in the strength upon manufacturing the sintered body from a molding powder while using a gel-forming material as a binder.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This invention provides a method of manufacturing a molding material. The method comprises the steps of;</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">mixing at least a molding powder, a powder of a gel-forming material and a solvent at a temperature not higher than a dissolving point of the gel-forming material to provide a mixture, while applying a treatment of pulverizing agglomerates containing the molding powder, the powder of said gel-forming material and the solvent absorbed in the material;</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">heating the mixture to a temperature not lower than the dissolving point while kneading said mixture to form a sol; and</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">cooling the sol to a temperature not higher than a gel point of the gel-forming material.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, in the molding method according to this invention, a molded body comprising the molding material is obtained. Specifically, the molding product is obtained by filling or supplying the molding material into a predetermined mold, and molding the same in the mold. Alternatively, the molded body is obtained by cooling the sol in the mold. Further, this invention also provides a method of obtaining a sintered body by sintering the molded body.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As has been described above, the present inventors have made a detailed study over the entire process for manufacturing the sintered body for the reason that the strength of the sintered bodies is lowered while the density of the sintered body is relatively high and have attained the following knowledge. That is, a molding powder, a gel-forming material, for example, an agar powder and a solvent were mixed at a room temperature and the resultant mixture was heated to a temperature not lower than the dissolving point of the gel-forming material, which was fluidized and kneaded. When the mixed slurry is observed closely, inhomogeneous suspensions were observed on the surface of the slurry. Further, after discharging the slurry out of the mixing vessel, adhesion of agglomerates was observed on the inner wall surface of the mixing vessel. The adhesion of the agglomerates on the inner wall surface of the mixing vessel were scraped off into the slurry and mixing was tried again, but the agglomerates were suspend again and adhered on the inner wall surface of the mixing vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When suspensions or adhesion on the inner wall surfaces were closely studied microscopically, it was found that a number of molding powders were firmly bonded by agar and agglomerated. Although the reason is not apparent at present, it may be estimated as below. That is, agar powder has an extremely small water content and has a property of rapidly absorbing water to the inside of the powder and swells while including water. When the agar powder is charged into a slurry, it abruptly absorbs water in the vicinity of the agar powder. In the field of the relevant art, the water content is generally small while the amount of the molding powder is large in a slurry. Therefore, when water in the vicinity of the agar powder is absorbed rapidly, the water content is locally lost at the periphery thereof to agglomerate the molding powder. It is considered that agar just after absorbing water performs as a binder in the inside of the agglomerates, resulting in strong agglomeration.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Based on the findings described above, the present inventors have adopted a process comprising the steps of mixing a molding powder, a gel-forming material powder and a solvent at a temperature not higher than the dissolving point of the gel-forming material and applying treatment of pulverizing agglomerates containing the molding powder, the gel-forming material powder and the solvent absorbed in the gel-forming powder and then heating and kneading the mixture at a temperature not lower than the dissolving point of the gel-forming material. As a result, the strength of the sintered body was improved. Further, it has been found that scattering of the strength of the sintered body is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, the present inventors have also made a study for sufficiently dissolving the gel-forming material, for example, agar by increasing the amount of a solvent, for example, water and using a great amount of water upon mixing the gel-forming material and the molding powder. That is, it has been attempted to suppress formation of agglomerates by supplying a sufficiently great amount of water even when agar rapidly absorbs water. However, since agar rapidly absorbs water to firmly adhere a fine molding powder at the periphery of agar particles, it is necessary to use a great amount of water. This extremely increases the water content in the mixture. However, since water in the mixture has to be removed in the subsequent drying step, this is extremely time and energy consuming in the drying step. According to this invention, since a sintered body of a high strength can be manufactured without increasing the cost in the drying step, it is useful for the reduction of the cost.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, this invention provides a method of manufacturing a molding material. The method comprises the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">mixing at least a molding powder, a powder of a gel-forming material and a solvent at a temperature not higher than a dissolving point of the gel-forming material to obtain a mixture, the powder of the gel-forming material requiring 50 minutes or more of time to increase the weight by 5% when the powder is maintained in an atmosphere at a temperature of 30&#xb0; C. and at a relative humidity of 100%;</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">heating and kneading the mixture at a temperature not lower than the dissolving point to form a sol; and</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">obtaining a molding material form the sol.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, this invention provides a method of manufacturing a molded body comprising the steps of mixing at least a molding powder, a gel-forming material powder and a solvent at a temperature not higher than the dissolving point of the gel-forming material powder thereby obtaining a mixture, the gel-forming powder used requiring 50 minutes or more of time to increase the weight by 5% when the gel-forming material powder is maintained in an atmosphere at a temperature of 30&#xb0; C. and at a relative humidity of 100%, then heating and kneading the mixture at a temperature not lower than the dissolving point thereby forming a sol, then forming a molding material from the sol, and then molding the molding material thereby obtaining a molded body. This invention also provides a method of manufacturing a sintered body by sintering the molded body described above.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, this invention also provides a molding material, a molded body and a sintered body obtained, respectively, by the methods described above.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As has been described above, the present inventors have made a detailed studied over the entire process of manufacturing the sintered body for the reason that the strength of the sintered body is lowered while the density of the sintered body is relatively high and have obtained the following knowledge. That is, a molding powder, a gel-forming material, for example, an agar powder and a solvent were mixed at a room temperature, the resultant mixture was heated to a temperature not lower than the dissolving point of the gel-forming material to be fluidized and then kneaded. In this process, when mixed slurry was observed closely, inhomogeneous suspensions were suspended on the surface of the slurry. Further, after discharging the slurry from a mixing vessel, adhesion of the agglomerates was observed on the inner wall surface of the mixing vessel. Agglomerates adhered on the inner wall surface of the mixing vessel were scraped off into the slurry and mixing was tried again but it was found that the agglomerates were suspended again and adhered on the inner wall surface of the mixing vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the suspensions or the adhesion on the inner wall surface were microscopically observed specifically, it was found that a number of molding powders were firmly bonded by agar and agglomerated. Although the reason is not apparent but it may be estimated as below. That is, the agar powder is highly water absorbing, and has a property of rapidly absorbing the water content to the inside of the agar powder and swelling with inclusion of water. When the agar powder is charged into a slurry, it rapidly absorbs water in the vicinity of the agar powder. In the field of the relevant art, the water content is relatively small, while the amount of the molding powder is large in the slurry. Therefore, when water in the vicinity of the agar powder is absorbed rapidly, water is locally deprived at the periphery thereof to agglomerate the molding powder. It is considered that agar just after absorption performs as the binder in the inside of the agglomerates, resulting in strong agglomeration.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, the present inventors have also made a study for sufficiently dissolving the gel-forming material, for example, agar in mixing the gel-forming material and the molding powder by increasing the amount of the solvent, for example, water and using a great amount of water. That is, it has been attempted to suppress the formation of agglomerates by using a great amount of water even when agar rapidly absorbs water. However, since agar rapidly absorbs water and a fine molding powder is firmly adhered around the agar particles, it is necessary to use a great amount of water. Therefore, the water content in the mixture is extremely large. However, since water in the mixture has to be removed in the subsequent drying step, this results in an enormous loss of time and energy in the drying step.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present inventors have found that the inhomogenity of the molded body and the low strength of the sintered body, due to the agglomeration of the molding powder upon mixing, can be suppressed by using such a gel-forming material powder having a lower initial solvent absorption speed upon mixing into the solvent as requiring 50 minutes or more of time to increase the weight by 5% when the material is maintained in an atmosphere at a temperature of 30&#xb0; C. and at a relative humidity of 100% and have accomplished the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this invention, a gel-forming material powder requiring 50 minutes or more of time to increase the weight by about 5% based on the initial weight when the material is maintained in an atmosphere at a temperature of 30&#xb0; C. and at a relative humidity of 100% is used and mixed with the molding powder and the solvent. The necessary time is preferably 50 minutes or more with a view point of this invention and most preferably 250 min or more. The upper limit of the necessary time has no particular restriction in view of the invention.</p>

There is no particular restriction on the molding powder as an object of this invention so long as the powder may be sintered by heating to form a sintered body. Further, it is preferred that the molding powder is not dissolved into a solvent or does not react with a solvent. The molding powder is preferably an inorganic powder and it is particularly preferably an inorganic powder intended to be used for sintering. The inorganic powder can include, typically, ceramic powder, metal powder, a powder of ceramic-metal composite material and a powder mixture thereof. The ceramics can include, for example, oxide series ceramics such as, for example, alumina, zirconia, titania, silica, magnesia, ferrite, cordielite and oxides of rare elements such as yttria; composite oxides such as barium titanate, strontium titanate, lead zirconate titanate, manganites of rare earth elements and chromites of rare earth elements; nitride series ceramics such as aluminum nitride, silicon nitride and sialon; and carbide series ceramics such as silicon carbide, boron carbide, and tungsten carbide. Further, the metal can include, for example, iron series metals such as iron, stainless steel and carbonyl iron, non-iron metals such as titanium, copper and aluminum or alloys of non-iron metals. The inorganic powder can further include graphite, glass and carbon. Further, the molding powder other than the inorganic powder can include, for example, resin powders.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the molding powder is mixed with the solvent and the gel-forming material, the molding powder tends to agglomerate more intensely at the periphery of gel-forming material particles when the solvent is deprived from the periphery of the gel-forming material as the grain size of the molding powder is smaller (the grains are smaller). Accordingly, this invention is particularly useful in a case where the average particle size of the molding powder is small. In view of the above, the average particle size of the molding powder is 10 &#x3bc;m or less in a preferred embodiment and 1 &#x3bc;m or less in a further preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">There is no particular restriction on the lower limit for the average particle size of the molding powder in view of the invention. It can be 0.1 &#x3bc;m or more with an economical view point, with no particular restriction thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A gel-forming material is such a material as forming a flowable sol upon heating to a temperature not lower than the dissolving point and then forming a gel upon cooling the sol to a temperature not higher than the gel point. As described in Japanese Patent No. 2604592, the gel-forming material having a gel strength of at least 500 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>at a temperature between 0 - 22&#xb0; C. is preferred. In a preferred embodiment, the gel-forming material forms a sol at a temperature not lower than the dissolving point and forms a gel at a temperature not higher than the gel point reversibly.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Particularly preferably, the gel-forming material is a natural or synthetic hydro-colloid. The hydro-colloid can include, for example, polysaccharides such as agar, carrageenan, furcellaran, alginic acid and derivatives thereof, Azotobactor-vinelandii-gum, gellan gum (deacyl type or native type), pectin, curdlan, starch and derivatives thereof, psyllium seed gum; and proteins such as gelatin, chitin, chitosan and modified milk protein. Further, it can include gel-forming materials with addition of at least one of locust bean gum, tara bean gum, casia gum, guar gum, fenugreek gum, konyac mannan (also including purified glucomannan), xanthan gum, tamarind gum, locust, gum arabic, arabino galactan, crystalline cellulose, sodium cellulose glucolate, methyl cellulose, gum ghatti, almond gum, welan gum, tragancanth gum, pllulan, and soy bean polysaccharides.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a particularly preferred embodiment, polysaccharides having galactose as the basic skeleton are used. The polysaccharide may preferably be an agaroid gel-forming material. The agaroid gel-forming material include all the agaroid gel-forming materials and includes not only agarose at high purity but also agar at low purity containing a great amount of an agaroid pectin ingredient and also includes modified agar. Pure agar is referred to as agarose, which is a neutral polysaccharide comprising &#x3b2;-D-galactopyranose bonded at the 1,3-positions and 3,6-anhydro-L-garactopyranose bonded at the 1,4-positions as repeating units. Further, the agaroid gel-forming material may also include derivatives of agarose. Agarose partially containing sulfate esters, methoxyl and pyruvic acid are referred to as agaropectin. Most of commercial agars are mixtures of agarose and agaropectin.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a case where agarose and agarose derivatives (typically agaropectin) are contained in the agaroid gel-forming material, the ratio of agarose and agarose derivative may be varied depending on the aimed application use. The agarose derivative contains ashes such as sodium, potassium, calcium and sulfuric acids. Therefore, it is preferred that the amount of the agarose derivative is smaller in such application use as fine ceramics, in which impurities should be avoided. Specifically, agarose at high purity with an ash content of 2% by weight or less is preferred and with an ash content of 1% by weight or less is particularly preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The solvent used herein is those for the gel-forming material that dissolve the gel-forming material powder, form a sol upon heating and form a gel upon lowering of the temperature. As the solvent, water is particularly preferred but it may be a hydrophilic organic solvent such as alcohols or a mixture of water and a hydrophilic organic solvent. The hydrophilic organic solvent preferably includes alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol, and alcohols substituted with chlorine or bromine atoms. This may be presumed that an alcohol penetrates into molecules of agar and, further, causes swelling by substitution with water, so that it no more absorbs water rapidly and less forms agglomerates.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the mixing step of the mixture, existence of the agglomerates can be confirmed by passing the mixture after mixing through a screen with a wire diameter of 390 &#x3bc;m and a mesh of 600 &#x3bc;m (JIS Z8801) and observing the presence of residues on the screen. Further, whether the agglomerates have been pulverized or not in the mixture can be confirmed by passing the mixture after pulverization through a screen with a wire diameter 390 &#x3bc;m and a mesh of 600 &#x3bc;m (JIS Z8801) and measuring the amount of residues on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The amount of the residues when the mixture after pulverization is passed through the screen in this invention is preferably 0.4 parts by weight or less, further preferably, 0.2 parts by weight or less and, particularly preferably, 0.1 parts by weight or less based on 100 parts by weight of the molding powder. For the measurement for the amount of the residues it is tested as below. That is, 100 parts by weight of a molding powder, 27.4 parts by weight of a solvent, 3 parts by weight of a gel-forming material and one part by weight of a dispersant (40% solution of ammonium polyacrylate polymer) are mixed. After the mixing, the mixture is passed through the screen described above and the weight ratio of the residues remaining on the screen is measured.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Whether a certain treatment constitutes a pulverization treatment or not can be determined depending on the ratio between the residual amount of the agglomerates on the screen when the treatment was applied upon mixing and the residual amount of the agglomerates on the screen when the treatment was not applied upon mixing. It is necessary that the residual amount is reduced at least to 50% or less by applying the treatment and, preferably, it is reduced to 20% or less, further preferably, 15% or less and, particularly preferably to 5% or less. So long as the condition is satisfied, there is no particular restriction for the concrete method of the pulverizing treatment. For example, it may be considered a method of cutting or disconnecting the agglomerates in the mixture by a cutting mechanism such as a chopper blade, as well as a method of crushing the agglomerates or providing the mixture with flow, thereby colliding the agglomerates to each other to decompose them.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since the agglomerates are relatively firm, they are less pulverized by flowing and stirring a mixture slurry of mixture by a usual mixing process. Therefore, it is preferred to provide a cutting mechanism for cutting the agglomerates in the slurry. Particularly preferably, a mixing vessel is provided with a flowing mechanism for circulating and flowing the slurry and a cutting mechanism for cutting agglomerates contained in the slurry during flowing. There are no particular restrictions on the flowing and cutting mechanisms. Preferably, the flowing mechanism is a stirring mechanism for stirring the slurry in the mixing vessel, including a blade, stirrer or the like. A planetary blade is particularly preferred. Further, the flowing mechanism may be a pipeline for flowing the slurry in the mixing vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The slurry of mixture during movement under flowing is passed in front of the cutting mechanism disposed in the flow channel to disconnect the agglomerates. The cutting mechanism is preferably a cutting blade or cutting tooth, and a chopper blade is, particularly preferred. A mixing vessel provided with such stirring mechanism and cutting mechanism can include, for example, high speed dispersing machines &#x201c;T. K. Homodisper&#x201d;, &#x201c;T. K. Homojetter&#x201d;, &#x201c;T. K. Pipeline Homomixer&#x201d; and &#x201c;T. K. Highvismix&#x201d; (manufactured by Tokushu Kika Kogyo K. K.).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In view of the efficient pulverization, the rotation speed of the cutting blade or the cutting tooth is preferably 500 rpm or more and, further preferably, 1000 rpm or more.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">However, when the rotation speed is excessively high, cost of the apparatus is increased and metal impurities may possibly intrude into the products by the abrasion of the blade. In view of the above, the rotation speed of the cutting blade or the cutting tooth is preferably 5000 rpm or less and, further preferably, 3000 rpm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The temperature upon mixing of the molding powder, the gel-forming material and the solvent is not higher than the dissolving point of the gel-forming material. The dissolving point of the gel-forming material is such a temperature that the gel-forming material dissolves into the solvent to form a sol when the gel-forming material and the solvent are mixed and then the temperature is elevated. Accordingly, the dissolving point may vary even for an identical gel-forming material when the solvent is different. In this invention, it is particularly preferred that mixing is conducted at a temperature somewhat lower than the dissolving point and, it is preferred to conduct mixing, for example, at a temperature lower by at least 30&#xb0; C. than the dissolving point and, further preferably, lower by at least 50&#xb0; C. than the dissolving point. When the gel-forming material is of agaroid, the mixing temperature is preferably 50&#xb0; C. or lower and, further preferably 40&#xb0; C. or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Then, the mixture of the molding powder, the gel-forming material and the solvent is heated and kneaded at a temperature not lower than the dissolving point of the gel-forming material to form a sol and then the sol is cooled to a temperature not higher than the gel point of the gel-forming material, thereby forming a molding material.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">During heat kneading, the mixture is heated to a temperature not lower than the dissolving point simultaneously with kneading to obtain a flowable sol. The heating temperature is different depending on the kind of the gel-forming material and it is, preferably, 85 to 120&#xb0; C. in a case of the agaroid gel-forming material. At a temperature of 100&#xb0; C. or higher, it is preferably pressurized in order to avoid boiling of water. Then, a molding product of a desired shape can be obtained by cooling the heat-kneaded product in a mold. Alternatively, a molding material is obtained by cooling the heat-kneading product and then the molding material is supplied into a mold, to obtain a molded body.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a preferred embodiment, the molding material is pelleted and, simultaneously, the water content of the pellet is controlled within a certain range. The pellet after controlling the water content is injected into an injection molding die to obtain a molded body. However, other molding methods, for example, a casting method or an extrusion molding method may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the mixture of this invention, the amount of the gel-forming material powder based on 100 parts by weight of the molding powder is preferably 1 part by weight or more and, further preferably, 3 parts by weight or more. This further increases the strength of the molded body. Further, the strength of the molded body can further be increased by using the gel-forming material having a high gel strength as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, the amount of the gel-forming material powder based on 100 parts by weight of the molding powder is preferably 10 parts by weight or less and, further preferably, 7 parts by weight or less. Since this decrease the amount of water deprived from the slurry of the mixture upon mixing the gel-forming material powder, micro-cracks formed in the sintered body can be suppressed effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the mixture of this invention, the amount of the solvent based on 100 parts by weight of the molding powder is preferably 40 parts by weight or less and, further preferably, 30 parts by weight or less. This reduces the cost in the drying step. By decreasing the amount of the solvent, formation of the agglomerates described above becomes remarkable to enhance the effect of this invention. On the other hand, with a view point of enabling the mixing effectively in a short period of time and increasing the strength of the sintered body, the amount of the solvent based on 100 parts by weight of the molding powder is preferably 40 parts by weight or more and, further preferably, 50 parts by weight or more.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The gel-forming material powder having the hygroscopic property described above can be prepared by applying a treatment to an appropriate commercially available starting material powder for suppressing the rapid absorption of the solvent. There are no particular restrictions on the kind and the shape of the starting material powder and the shape can include powdery, flaky, granular, network-like or other special shapes. Further, when the gel-forming material is agar, it may be agar prepared from Gelidum amansii Lamuroux, Pterocladia tenuis Okamura, Acanthopeltis japonicum Okamura, G. conferoides Papen., thymi Campylaephora hypnaeoides Okamura, Ceramium boidenii Gepp. and Eucheuma muricaum Weber van Bosse.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As the treatment for suppressing rapid absorption of the solvent, the following treating methods are preferred.
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0055">(1) Water, a hydrophilic solvent or a mixed solvent of water and the hydrophilic solvent is added to the gel-forming material powder. The hydrophilic solvent can include, preferably, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol, and alcohols substituted with chlorine or bromine atoms.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">In this case, water, the hydrophilic solvent or the mixed solvent can be sprayed to the gel-forming material powder. Preferably, water, hydrophilic solvent or mixed solvent is sprayed to the starting powder for the gel-forming material after spreading the same on a plane. Further, the starting powder for the gel-forming material can be kept in a highly humid atmosphere. In this case, the relative humidity is preferably 80% or higher and the temperature is preferably 10 to 30&#xb0; C. in the atmosphere. Particularly preferably, the powder is humidified by being kept in an atmosphere at a temperature of 30&#xb0; C. and at a relative humidity of 100%.
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0057">(2) The gel-forming material powder is coated with a water soluble polymer. For example, an agar powder is immersed in an aqueous solution of a water soluble polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol or polyethylene glycol. After solid-liquid separation by filtration, the agar powder is dried.</li>

<p id="p-0057" num="0058">As an alumina powder, 6000 g of an easily sinterable low soda alumina content powder (&#x201c;AES-11&#x201d;, manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Industry Co., purity: 99.5%, BET specific surface area: 7 m<sup>2</sup>/g, average particle size: 0.5 &#x3bc;m) was used. As a dispersant, one part by weight of ammonium polyacrylate copolymer (&#x201c;A-6114&#x201d;, manufactured by Toa Gosei Co., molecular weight: 10000 MW, pH: 7-9, 39-41% solution) was added based on 100 parts by weight of the alumina powder, ion exchanged water was added so as to adjust the water content to 21.5 parts by weight and mixed thoroughly. Then, the mixture was pulverized for 5 hours in a pot mill using nylon balls as pulverization media. The resultant slurry was passed through a screen having a wire diameter of 390 &#x3bc;m and a mesh of 600 &#x3bc;m (JIS Z8801) and then placed in a mixing vessel. As a mixing vessel, &#x201c;T. K. Highvismix&#x201d; (manufactured by Tokushu Kika Kogyo K. K.) was used. The mixing vessel was provided with a planetary blade (twisted blade) and a chopper blade.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">Powdered agar (&#x201c;XG89&#x201d;, manufactured by Ina Shokuhin Kogyo K. K. having gel strength of 840 g/cm<sup>2</sup>) was weighed at a ratio of 3 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the alumina powder. While stirring the mixture, the agar powder was charged stepwise into the mixing vessel. 5 min after charging the entire amount of the weighed agar powder, the lid of the mixing vessel was opened, solid adhesion on the planetary blade, on the chopper blade and on the inner wall surface were scraped into the slurry and then mixed again for 5 min. The resultant slurry was passed through a screen having a wire diameter of 390 &#x3bc;m and a mesh of 600 &#x3bc;m (JIS Z8801), and the weight of the solids remaining on the screen was measured. The solids were agglomerates. The rotation speed for the planetary blade and the rotation speed for the chopper were changed as shown in Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">Then, the mixing vessel was heated to dissolve and, simultaneously, knead the agar powder. The temperature was elevated from a room temperature to 95&#xb0; C. for 30 min. While keeping the temperature of the material at 95&#xb0; C., the planetary blade was rotated at a rotation speed of 30 rpm to knead the slurry (without rotating the chopper). Upon temperature elevation, rotation of the planetary blade was stopped. Kneading was conducted at 95&#xb0; C. for 30 min, the resultant kneading product was cooled down to a room temperature to obtain a molding material. The molding material was taken out of the mixing vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">The molding material was pelleted while controlling the humidity so that the water content of the pellet was adjusted to 17.5%. The pellets after the humidity control was molded by an electromotive injection molding machine at 30 ton die clamping to mold flat plates each of 60 mm for each side and 6 mm in thickness. After drying the molding product at a room temperature over one day and one night, the residual water content was removed in a drying apparatus at 130&#xb0; C., and it was sintered under the conditions at a temperature elevation rate of 300&#xb0; C./hr, at a maximum temperature of 1620&#xb0; C. for a retention time at 1620&#xb0; C. of 2 hours. Cooling was conducted by spontaneous cooling. The resultant sintered body was fabricated and a test specimen sized 4 mm&#xd7;3 mm&#xd7;40 mm according to JIS (R1601) was cut out and density and 4-point bending strength were measured for the test specimen.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0063">As can be seen from the results, the amount of residues on the screen when the slurry after mixing was passed through the screen in Examples 1 to 6 was remarkably reduced compared with Comparative Examples 1 to 3. In Comparative Examples 1 to 3, agglomerates suspended in the vicinity of the surface of the slurry and suspensions were adhered on the surface of the blade or on the inner wall surface of the mixing vessel. The adhesion were sprayed off into the mixing vessel and the mixing was tried again but the agglomerates were hard and could not be pulverized by the planetary blade. In Examples 1 to 6, such agglomerates were pulverized.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">The density of each sintered body of Comparative Examples 1 to 3 was as large as about 3.92 g/cc, which was not substantially different from the density of each sintered body of Examples 1 to 6. This is because the amount of agar (organic material) in the mixture is small and most of the slurry comprises alumina powder. Indeed, it is considered that when agglomerates are formed in the slurry, scattering may occur in the amount of the alumina powder or agar also in the molded body. However, since agar is dissipated in the course of the sintering, it gives no substantial effect in view of the density of the entire sintered body. Accordingly, even when agglomerates are formed in the mixture, the density of the sintered body is scarcely lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">On the other hand, the strength of the sintered body has a close concern with the size, the shape and the frequency of occurrence of defects in the sintered body. It is considered that when the agglomerates are present in the slurry, the portions where agar and water are dissipated in the course of sintering remain as coarse portions or pores to act as defects. It is considered that such defects act as stress concentration sources, leading to deterioration of the strength.</p>

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(Starting material powder)</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">As the starting material powder for agar, agar powders of each of kinds and jelly strength shown in Table 2 and Table 3 were used. Among them, &#x201c;UM-11&#x201d; is instantly soluble agar.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(Pre-treatment)</p>

(Measurement for absorption time)
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0072">The water absorption time of each agar powder was measured as described below. That is, the agar powder was thinly scattered on a vat, kept in a thermostable and humidity stable vessel at a temperature of 30&#xb0; C. and at a relative humidity of 100%, and the time at the instance absorbing 5 wt % of water based on the initial weight was measured. As the absorption time is shorter, agglomerates tend to be formed more when the agar powder is charged into the slurry. Relation between the humidifying time and change of weight when &#x201c;XG-89&#x201d; (jelly strength 840 g/cm<sup>2</sup>) was applied with various types of pre-treatments is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(Preparation of slurry of mixture)</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0073">As an alumina powder, 6000 g of an easily sinterable low soda alumina content powder (&#x201c;AES11 C&#x201d;, manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Industry Co., purity: 99.5%, BET specific surface area: 8 m<sup>2</sup>/g, average particle size: 0.5 &#x3bc;m) was used. As a dispersant, 0.9% by weight of ammonium polyacrylate copolymer (&#x201c;A-6114&#x201d;, manufactured by Toa Gosei Co., molecular weight: 10000 MW, pH: 7-9, 39-41% solution) was added based on the alumina powder, ion exchanged water was added so as to adjust the water content to 25% by weight and mixed thoroughly. Then, it was mixed for 12 hours in a pot mill using monomalon media as a pulverization media. The resultant slurry was passed through a screen having a wire diameter of 390 &#x3bc;m and a mesh of 600 &#x3bc;m (JIS Z8801) and then charged in a mixing vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0074">Each of the previously prepared agar powders was weighed at a ratio of 3 parts by weight (based on the weight of the agar powder before pre-treatment) based on 100 parts by weight of the alumina powder. While stirring the mixture, the agar powder was charged stepwise into the mixing vessel. 5 min after charging all the weighed agar powder, the lid of the mixing vessel was opened, solids adhered on the inner wall surface were sprayed off into the slurry and then mixed again for 5 min. The resultant slurry was passed on a screen having a wire diameter of 390 &#x3bc;m and a mesh of 600 &#x3bc;m (JIS Z8801) and the weight of solids remaining on the screen was measured. The solids were agglomerates.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(Heating and kneading)</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0075">Then, the mixing vessel was heated to dissolve and, simultaneously, knead the agar powder. The temperature was elevated from a room temperature to 95&#xb0; C. for 30 min. While keeping the temperature of the material at 95&#xb0; C., the slurry was kneaded. Kneading was conducted at 95&#xb0; C. for 30 min, the resultant kneading product was cooled down to a room temperature to obtain a molding material. The molding material was taken out of the mixing vessel.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(Molding and sintering)</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0076">The molding material was pelleted while controlling the humidity and the water content of the pellet was adjusted to 17% by weight. The pellets after humidity control was molded by an electromotive injection molding machine at 30 ton die clamping to mold flat plates each of 60 mm for each side and 6 mm in thickness. After drying the molding product at a room temperature over one day and one night, the residual water content was removed in a drier at 130&#xb0; C., and it was sintered under the conditions at a temperature elevation rate of 300&#xb0; C./hr, at a maximum temperature of 1620&#xb0; C. for a retention time at 1620&#xb0; C. of 2 hours. Cooling was conducted by spontaneous cooling. The resultant sintered body was fabricated and a test specimen sized 4 mm&#xd7;3 mm&#xd7;40 mm according to JIS (R1601) was cut out and density and 4-point bending strength were measured for the test specimen. The result of the measurement described above is shown in Table 2 and Table 3. Further, a relation between the water absorption time for absorbing 5% by weight of water based on the initial weight, and the 4-point bending strength is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, while a relation between the water absorption time for absorbing 5% by weight of water based on the initial weight, and the residues on the screen (parts by weight) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0079">As shown in Table 2, when the slurry after the mixing was passed through the screen, the amount of residues on the screen was reduced in Examples A3, A4, A5 and A6 compared with those in Comparative Examples A1 and A2. Particularly, in Example A5, since ethanol intrudes into molecules of agar and further causes swelling by substitution with water, it no more absorbs water rapidly and forms less agglomerates. Then, the strength of the sintered body was remarkably improved in Examples A3, A4, A5 and A6 compared with Comparative Examples 1 and 2. On the other hand, the density of the sintered body was not substantially changed among the Examples A1 to A6.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0080">The reason is considered as below. Since agar is lost in the course of sintering, agar has no concerns with the lowering of the density of the sintered body also in a case where agar has caused agglomeration. On the other hand, the strength of the sintered body has a close concern with the size, the shape and the frequency of occurrence of defects in the sintered body. It is considered that when the agglomerates are present in the slurry, the portions where agar and water are dissipated in the course of sintering remain as coarse portions or pores to act as defects. Such defects acts as stress concentration sources, leading to deterioration of the strength.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0081">Further, similar effects were also obtained in a case of comparison between Comparative Examples B1 and B2 with Examples B3, B4, B5 and B6, between Comparative Examples C1 and C2 with Examples C3, C4, C5 and C6, between Comparative Examples D1 and D2 with Examples D3, D4, D5 and D6, between Comparative Examples E1 and E2 with Examples E3, E4, E5 and E6, and between Comparative Examples F1 and F2 with Examples F3, F4, F5 and E6.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0082">As can be seen from the result described above, when the water absorption amount till the instance absorbing 5% by weight of the water based on the initial weight is less than 50 min, the strength is as low as less than 310 MPa, while in a case where the water absorption time is 50 to 250 min, the strength increases as 360 to 390 MPa. Further, when the water absorption time is 250 min or more, the strength further increases as 410 to 436 MPa.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a composition for forming a silicon film and a method for forming a silicon film. More specifically, the present invention relates to a silicon-film-forming composition containing specific silicon particles and a method for forming a polysilicon film by use of the composition.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As a method for forming an amorphous silicon film or polysilicon film used in production of a solar battery, a thermal CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method using a monosilane or disilane gas, plasma CVD method or optical CVD method has heretofore been employed. In general, the thermal CVD method (refer to J. Vac. Sci. Technology., Vol. 14, p. 1082 (1977)) is widely used to form the polysilicon film, and the plasma CVD method (refer to Solid State Com., Vol. 17, p. 1193 (1975)) is widely used to form the amorphous silicon film.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, the formation of the silicon films by these CVD methods has problems that since a gas phase reaction is used, the contamination of equipment and/or production of foreign materials are/is caused by by-production of silicon particles in the gas phase, thereby lowering a production yield, that since the raw material is in gaseous form, it is difficult to form a silicon film having a uniform film thickness on a substrate having an uneven surface, that productivity is low due to a low film formation rate and that complex and expensive high frequency generator and vacuum device are required in the plasma CVD method. Therefore, further improvements in these CVD methods have been waited.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As for the raw material, since gaseous silicon hydride which is highly toxic and reactive is used, it is difficult to handle, and a sealable vacuum device is required since the raw material is in gaseous form. In general, these devices are large and expensive and also cause an increase in production costs since they consume a large amount of energy for a vacuum system or a plasma system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, in recent years, a method of coating liquid silicon hydride without using the vacuum system has been proposed. JP-A 1-29661 (the term &#x201c;JP-A&#x201d; as used herein means an &#x201c;unexamined published Japanese patent application&#x201d;) discloses a method of forming a silicon-based thin film by causing a gaseous raw material to liquefy and adsorb on a cooled substrate and react with chemically active atomic hydrogen. However, this method has problems that a complex device is required since gasification and cooling of silicon hydride as the raw material are carried out successively and that it is difficult to control the thickness of the film.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, JP-A 7-267621 discloses a method of coating low-molecular-weight liquid silicon hydride to a substrate. However, this method is difficult to use since the system is unstable, and since the raw material is in liquid form, it is difficult to obtain a uniform film thickness when it is coated on a substrate with a large area.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, an example of a solid silicon hydride polymer is reported in British Patent GB-2077710A. However, a film cannot be formed by a coating method since the polymer is insoluble in a solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, a polysilicon film for use in a solar battery and the like is produced primarily by a method comprising the steps of forming an amorphous silicon film by the thermal CVD method (for example, J. Vac. Sci. Technology., Vol. 14, p. 1082 (1977)) using a monosilane or disilane gas as a raw material or the plasma CVD method (for example, Solid State Com., Vol. 17, p. 1193 (1975)) and then converting the amorphous silicon film into a polysilicon film by laser annealing, a hydrogen plasma treatment or other treatment. The formation of the silicon film by use of the thermal or plasma CVD method has problems that:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">(1) since a gas phase reaction is used, silicon particles are produced in the gas phase and cause the contamination of equipment and/or production of foreign materials, thereby lowering a production yield,</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0010">(2) since the raw material is in gaseous form, it is difficult to form a silicon film having a uniform thickness on a substrate having an uneven surface,</li>

    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0012">(4) complex and expensive high frequency generator and vacuum device are required in the plasma CVD method. Therefore, further improvements in these CVD methods have been waited.</li>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0018">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">A silicon-film-forming composition of the present invention comprises silicon particles and a dispersion medium.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">The above silicon particles may be any silicon particles as long as the object and effect of the present invention are not impaired. However, they are polycrystalline or monocrystalline and are preferably of high purity. Such silicon particles can be produced by, for example, grinding polycrystalline or monocrystalline silicon ingot and can be produced by subjecting the thus ground silicon to a thermal plasma treatment. Illustrative examples of ingots which can be used for producing the silicon particles include a high-purity i-type silicon ingot, a high-purity n-type silicon ingot and a high-purity p-type silicon ingot.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021">The above i-type silicon ingot is preferably of high purity and preferably has a purity of not lower than 99.99%, more preferably not lower than 99.9999%, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022">The above n-type silicon ingot may be doped with, for example, a nitrogen atom, a phosphorus atom or an arsenic atom. Of these doping atoms, the phosphorus atom is preferred. The amount of doping is generally about 10<sup>10 </sup>to 10<sup>21 </sup>atom/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably 10<sup>15 </sup>to 10<sup>20 </sup>atom/cm<sup>3</sup>. With a doping amount of the above range, a silicon film to be formed can be an n-type semiconductor film showing suitable electric properties.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">The above p-type silicon ingot may be doped with, for example, a boron atom or a gallium atom. Of these doping atoms, the boron atom is preferred. The amount of doping is generally about 10<sup>10 </sup>to 10<sup>21 </sup>atom/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably 10<sup>15 </sup>to 10<sup>20 </sup>atom/cm<sup>3</sup>. With a doping amount of the above range, a silicon film to be formed can be a p-type semiconductor film showing suitable electric properties.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">To grind the above silicon ingots, dry grinding or wet grinding may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">When ground silicon is used as the silicon particles of the present invention, it is convenient to use a method comprising the steps of pre-grinding the ingot to appropriate sizes by dry grinding and then wet-grinding the pre-ground silicon by use of a dispersion medium to be contained in the silicon-film-forming composition of the present invention, because the resulting product can be directly used as the silicon-film-forming composition of the present invention after completion of the grinding.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">The above dry grinding can be carried out in accordance with a known method by use of a chip crusher, a hammer crusher, a cutter mill or the like. In such pre-grinding, it is convenient for subsequent steps that the particle diameters of silicon particles are preferably about 10 to 500 &#x3bc;m, more preferably about 50 to 300 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">The silicon particles are preferably cleaned between the end of the above dry grinding and the start of the above wet grinding by use of an appropriate cleaning agent. By this washing treatment, compounds resulting from degeneration of silicon, such as silicon oxide formed on the surfaces of the silicon particles during the dry grinding, and foreign materials such as metals and metal compounds mixed in during the grinding can be removed, whereby the silicon particles to be contained in the composition of the present invention can be of higher purity. For the above cleaning treatment, an RCA cleaning method (refer to RCA Review, 1970 (June), p187) or a cleaning method using an appropriate cleaning agent such as aqua regia or a hydrofluoric acid solution can be employed, for example. Further, these methods can be used in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028">The above wet grinding can be carried out in accordance with a known method by use of a bead mill, a ball mill, a high pressure liquid impact type mill or the like. As a medium used in the wet grinding, the dispersion medium to be contained in the composition of the present invention can be used. The dispersion medium will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">The particle diameters of the silicon particles after the wet grinding can be adjusted to the particle diameters of the silicon particles to be contained in the silicon-film-forming composition of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">The particle diameters of the silicon particles to be contained in the silicon-film-forming composition of the present invention can take any values according to a desired film thickness and the like. For example, they may be preferably 0.001 to 20 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 0.005 to 10 &#x3bc;m, much more preferably 0.01 to 5 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">Further, when ground silicon is further subjected to a thermal plasma treatment so as to be used as the silicon particles of the present invention, the ground silicon can be obtained by grinding such a silicon ingot as described above by an arbitrary method such as dry grinding or wet grinding in the same manner as described above. In some cases, a method can be employed in which the ingot is pre-ground to appropriate sizes by the dry grinding and then dry-ground or wet-ground by use of the dispersion medium.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">The above dry pre-grinding can be carried out in accordance with a known method by use of a chip crusher, a hammer crusher, a cutter mill or the like. In such pre-grinding, it is convenient for subsequent steps that the particle diameters of silicon particles are preferably about 10 to 5,000 &#x3bc;m, more preferably about 50 to 1,000 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">When dry grinding is further carried out after the above dry pre-grinding, the dry grinding can be carried out in accordance with a known method by use of a bead mill, a ball mill or the like. Meanwhile, when wet grinding is carried out after the above dry pre-grinding, the wet grinding can be carried out in accordance with a known method by use of a bead mill, a ball mill, a high pressure liquid impact type mill or the like. As a medium used in the wet grinding, the dispersion medium to be contained in the composition of the present invention can be used. The dispersion medium will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">After completion of the above grinding treatment, the silicon particles are preferably cleaned by use of such an appropriate cleaning agent as described above due to the same reason as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">The average particle diameter of the above ground silicon to be subjected to the thermal plasma method is generally 0.01 to 1,000 &#x3bc;m, preferably 0.1 to 100 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 1 to 30 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">The thus obtained ground silicon is subjected to the thermal plasma treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">That is, the thus obtained ground silicon is sent to a thermal plasma treatment step. For the thermal plasma treatment, thermal plasma treatment equipment described in JP-A 2000-219901 can be used, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">Thermal plasma treatment equipment <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a plasma torch <b>12</b> which has a plasma chamber <b>12</b><i>a</i>, a quartz double pipe <b>14</b>, a cooling double pipe <b>16</b>, a quenching pipe <b>18</b>, a ground silicon supplying device <b>20</b>, and a product recovering section <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">The plasma torch <b>12</b> comprises a quartz pipe <b>12</b><i>b </i>which constitutes the plasma chamber <b>12</b><i>a </i>in which thermal plasma (plasma flame) <b>13</b> is produced, a high frequency transmitting coil <b>12</b><i>c </i>which is attached to the outside of the quartz pipe <b>12</b><i>b</i>, a cooling jacket pipe <b>12</b><i>d </i>which is attached to the outside of the high frequency transmitting coil <b>12</b><i>c</i>, a gas ejection port <b>12</b><i>e </i>which is provided in the upper portion of the quartz pipe <b>12</b><i>b </i>and ejects a gas for plasma in a tangential direction, an axial direction and a radial direction, and a supply port <b>12</b><i>f </i>for supplying ground silicon to the thermal plasma <b>13</b> formed in the plasma chamber <b>12</b><i>a</i>. The plasma torch <b>12</b> is a double pipe comprising the quartz pipe <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the jacket pipe <b>12</b><i>d </i>with the coil <b>12</b><i>c </i>interposed therebetween. However, the coil <b>12</b><i>c </i>may be attached to the outside of the jacket pipe <b>12</b><i>d</i>. Further, the plasma torch <b>12</b> may be constituted by three or more pipes and is not particularly limited in size. Further, the plasma gas ejecting directions of the gas ejection port <b>12</b><i>e </i>are not limited to three directions, and the gas may be ejected in various directions.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">The gas ejection port <b>12</b><i>e </i>is connected to one or more gas supply sources <b>12</b><i>g </i>at the external top of the plasma torch <b>12</b>. When a gas for plasma is supplied from the gas supply source <b>12</b><i>g </i>to the gas ejection port <b>12</b><i>e</i>, the gas for plasma is ejected from the gas ejection port <b>12</b><i>e </i>into the plasma chamber <b>12</b><i>a </i>in the above three directions. The ejected gas for plasma is formed into plasma by the high frequency transmitting coil <b>12</b><i>c </i>to which a high frequency voltage is applied from a high frequency (RF) power source and forms thermal plasma <b>13</b> in the plasma chamber <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the plasma torch <b>12</b>. The gas for plasma supplied from the gas ejection port <b>12</b><i>e </i>is limited to a noble gas such as argon or helium, a gas such as hydrogen or nitrogen or a mixed gas thereof. The amount of the above gas supplied from the gas ejection port <b>12</b><i>e </i>can be selected as appropriate according to the size of the plasma chamber <b>12</b><i>a, </i>the characteristics of the thermal plasma <b>13</b> and the amount of ground silicon. The high frequency (frequency) and voltage (or electric power) of the high frequency voltage applied to the high frequency transmitting coil <b>12</b><i>c </i>are not particularly limited and can be selected as appropriate according to the characteristics of the thermal plasma <b>13</b> such as a temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">The temperature of the thus formed thermal plasma <b>13</b> is required to be equal to or higher than the boiling point of the silicon because the thermal plasma must gasify the ground silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">The higher the temperature of the thermal plasma <b>13</b>, the more easily the ground silicon can be gasified. Thus, the higher the temperature of the thermal plasma <b>13</b>, the more preferable it is. However, the temperature of the thermal plasma <b>13</b> is not particularly limited.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">Specifically, the temperature of the thermal plasma <b>13</b> may be, for example, 6,000&#xb0; C. or higher. Meanwhile, the upper limit of the temperature of the thermal plasma <b>13</b> is also not particularly limited and is difficult to measure and is therefore difficult to set the upper limit. However, it is conceived that the upper limit reaches around 10,000&#xb0; C. in theory.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">Further, the atmosphere of the thermal plasma <b>13</b> is also not particularly limited but is preferably an atmosphere not higher than an atmospheric pressure, i.e., an atmospheric pressure atmosphere or reduced pressure atmosphere. The atmosphere not higher than the atmospheric pressure of the thermal plasma <b>13</b> is not particularly limited but is preferably 200 Torr to 600 Torr.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">The ground silicon supply port <b>12</b><i>f </i>is also connected to the ground silicon supplying device <b>20</b> at the external top of the plasma torch <b>12</b>. The ground silicon is carried by a carrier gas from the supplying device <b>20</b> to the supply port <b>12</b><i>f </i>and introduced into the thermal plasma. The carrier gas for carrying the ground silicon is limited to a noble gas such as argon or helium, a gas such as hydrogen or nitrogen or a mixed gas thereof. The gas for plasma or a portion thereof (one or more gases before mixing) may be used as the carrier gas for carrying the ground silicon. The ground silicon thus introduced into the thermal plasma <b>13</b> is heated by the heat of the thermal plasma <b>13</b> and gasified instantaneously. In the thermal plasma <b>13</b>, the ground silicon exists in a gaseous state. The amount of the ground silicon supplied from the supply port <b>12</b><i>f </i>and the kind and amount of the carrier gas which carries the ground silicon are also not particularly limited and can be selected as appropriate according to the characteristics of the thermal plasma <b>13</b> and the amount of the ground silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">The quartz double pipe <b>14</b> is provided under the plasma torch <b>12</b> and has a quartz pipe <b>14</b><i>b </i>which has a slightly larger diameter than that of the quartz pipe <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the plasma torch <b>12</b> and a cooling jacket pipe <b>14</b><i>c </i>which is provided outside the quartz pipe <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The quartz pipe <b>14</b><i>b </i>constitutes a cooling chamber <b>14</b><i>a </i>which derives the ground silicon gasified by the thermal plasma <b>13</b> from the thermal plasma <b>13</b> and subjects the silicon gas to primary cooling. The cooling double pipe <b>16</b> is provided under the quartz double pipe <b>14</b> and has an inner pipe <b>16</b><i>b </i>which has nearly the same diameter as that of the quartz pipe <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the quartz double pipe <b>14</b> and a cooling jacket pipe <b>16</b><i>c </i>which is provided outside the inner pipe <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The inner pipe <b>16</b><i>b </i>constitutes a cooling chamber <b>16</b><i>a </i>which further subjects the gaseous, liquid or solid silicon which has been subjected to the primary cooling in the quartz double pipe <b>14</b> to secondary cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">The quenching pipe <b>18</b> is provided under the cooling double pipe <b>16</b> and has an inner pipe <b>18</b><i>b </i>which has a significantly larger diameter than that of the quartz pipe <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the cooling double pipe <b>16</b> and a cooling jacket pipe <b>18</b><i>c </i>which is provided outside the inner pipe <b>18</b><i>b</i>. The inner pipe <b>18</b><i>b </i>constitutes a silicon particle producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>which quenches the gaseous, liquid or solid silicon which has been subjected to the secondary cooling in the cooling double pipe <b>16</b> so as to produce silicon particles to be used in the present invention. In the silicon particle producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the quenching pipe <b>18</b>, the gaseous or liquid silicon subjected to the secondary cooling in the cooling double pipe <b>16</b> is quenched, thereby producing finer silicon than solid ground silicon, i.e., thermal-plasma-treated silicon particles to be used in the present invention, directly from the gaseous or liquid silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">The atmosphere inside the silicon particle producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the quenching pipe <b>18</b> for quenching the gaseous or liquid silicon is preferably an inert atmosphere or a reducing atmosphere so as to suppress or prevent oxidation of silicon, i.e., production of an oxide of metal silicon. The inert atmosphere and the reducing atmosphere are not particularly limited. Illustrative examples thereof include an atmosphere comprising at least one inert gas selected from argon (Ar), helium (He) and nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) and atmospheres comprising hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and these inert gases. Specific examples of the inert atmosphere include noble gas atmospheres such as an argon atmosphere and a helium atmosphere, a nitrogen gas atmosphere, and a mixed gas atmosphere comprising argon or helium and a nitrogen gas, and specific examples of the reducing atmosphere include a hydrogen-containing argon atmosphere, a hydrogen-containing helium atmosphere, and a hydrogen-containing nitrogen gas atmosphere. Further, the degree of reducibility of the reducing atmosphere is also not limited. Furthermore, although the quartz double pipe <b>14</b>, the cooling double pipe <b>16</b> and the quenching pipe <b>18</b> also have a double pipe structure as in the case of the plasma torch <b>12</b>, the present invention is not limited to the particular structure. Each of these pipes may be constituted by three or more pipes and is also not particularly limited in size.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">The product recovering section <b>22</b> is a section where thermal-plasma-treated silicon particles produced in the silicon-particle-producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the quenching pipe <b>18</b> are recovered and is provided on the exterior of the lower portion of the quenching pipe <b>18</b>. The product recovering section <b>22</b> comprises a recovery chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>which is communicated with the silicon-particle-producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a</i>, a filter <b>22</b><i>b </i>which is provided between the recovery chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the silicon-particle-producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>so as to separate and recover silicon particles from a fluidizing gas such as a carrier gas or a gas for plasma, and a gas suction discharge port <b>22</b><i>c </i>which suctions the silicon particles in the silicon-particle-producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>together with the above fluidizing gas and suctions and discharges only the above fluidizing gas separated by the filter <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">The gas suction discharge port <b>22</b><i>c </i>is connected to a gas suction source <b>22</b><i>d </i>on the external top of the product recovering section <b>22</b>. The fluidizing gas suctioned by the gas suction source <b>22</b><i>d </i>via the gas suction port <b>22</b><i>c </i>comprises the gas for plasma such as argon or nitrogen used for producing the thermal plasma <b>13</b> and the carrier gas such as argon for carrying the ground silicon. The fluidizing gas is sucked into the product recovering section <b>22</b> from the silicon-particle-producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>together with the silicon particles. However, the particles produced in the silicon-particle-producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>are recovered completely in the recovery chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>by the filter <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and from the gas suction discharge port <b>22</b><i>c, </i>only the fluidizing gas separated by the filter <b>22</b><i>b </i>is discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">The ground silicon supplying device <b>20</b> is intended for supplying ground silicon to the thermal plasma <b>13</b> inside the plasma torch <b>12</b> by causing a carrier gas such as argon to carry the ground silicon and has a reserving chamber for reserving the ground silicon, a mixing chamber for causing the ground silicon reserved in the reserving chamber to be carried by the carrier gas, and a gas supply source for supplying the carrier gas to the mixing chamber. The thermal plasma treatment equipment <b>10</b> for producing silicon particles which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has the quartz double pipe <b>14</b> and the cooling double pipe <b>16</b> for carrying out two-step intermediate cooling, i.e., the primary cooling and the secondary cooling, between the plasma torch <b>12</b> for gasifying ground silicon and the quenching pipe <b>18</b> for quenching the gasified ground silicon so as to produce silicon particles. The thermal plasma treatment equipment <b>10</b> may be completely free from these intermediate cooling means or may have means for carrying out single-step intermediate cooling or means for carrying out intermediate cooling comprising three or more steps.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">The thermal plasma treatment equipment of the present invention which carries out the thermal plasma treatment step in the production process of silicon particles is basically constituted as described above. Hereinafter, its effect and the thermal plasma treatment step for producing silicon particles will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">Firstly, ground silicon obtained as described above is sent to the thermal plasma treatment step and supplied to the ground silicon supplying device <b>20</b> of the thermal plasma treatment equipment <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At this point, in the thermal plasma treatment equipment <b>10</b>, a predetermined high frequency voltage is being applied to the high frequency transmitting coil <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the plasma torch <b>12</b>, a gas for plasma supplied from the gas supply source <b>12</b><i>g </i>is being ejected from the gas ejection port <b>12</b><i>e</i>, and thermal plasma (plasma flame) <b>13</b> is being produced and retained in the plasma chamber <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">Then, when the ground silicon is supplied from the ground silicon supplying device <b>20</b> to the thermal plasma <b>13</b> which is formed in the plasma chamber <b>12</b><i>a </i>through the supply port <b>12</b><i>f</i>, the ground silicon evaporates and becomes a gas. Thus, the ground silicon gasified by the thermal plasma <b>13</b> descends from the plasma chamber <b>12</b><i>a </i>so as to get out of the thermal plasma <b>13</b>, enters the cooling chamber <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the quartz double pipe <b>14</b> so as to be subjected to the primary cooling, and further descends and enters the cooling chamber <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the cooling double pipe <b>16</b> so as to be subjected to the secondary cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">Then, the ground silicon which has undergone the secondary cooling and been gasified or partially liquefied further descends and enters the silicon particle producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the quenching pipe <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">The size of the silicon particle producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>is significantly larger than the size of the cooling chamber <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the cooling double pipe <b>16</b>. Therefore, the gasified or partially liquefied silicon which has entered the silicon particle producing chamber <b>18</b><i>a </i>is quenched and solidified at once, whereby thermal-plasma-treated silicon particles which are finer than the ground silicon as a raw material, in other words, which have smaller particle diameters than those of the ground silicon, e.g., particle diameters of tenth to larger than twentieth, are produced.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">As described above, the production method of the thermal-plasma-treated silicon particles is not limited to the two-step intermediate cooling conducted by the quartz double pipe <b>14</b> and the cooling double pipe <b>16</b>. Single-step intermediate cooling or intermediate cooling comprising three or more steps may also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">The production method of the thermal-plasma-treated silicon particles is basically constituted as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">The particle diameters of the thermal-plasma-treated silicon particles contained in the silicon-film-forming composition of the present invention can be set at any appropriate values according to a desired film thickness and the like. For example, the particle diameters may be set at preferably 0.001 to 10 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 0.005 to 5 &#x3bc;m, much more preferably 0.01 to 1 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">As the dispersion medium contained in the silicon-film-forming composition of the present invention, those which disperse the above silicon particles and do not react with the silicon particles are used. Illustrative examples of the dispersion medium include a hydrocarbon-based solvent such as n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, decane, dicyclopentane, benzene, toluene, xylene, durene, indene, tetrahydronaphthalene, decahydronaphthalene or squalane; an ether-based solvent such as diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, ethylene glycol methyl ethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol methyl ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran tetrahydropyran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether, p-dioxane or tetrahydrofuran; and a polar solvent such as propylene carbonate, &#x3b3;-butyrolactone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl formamide and acetonitrile. Of these, the hydrocarbon-based solvent is preferred in view of the stability of the solution. These solvents may be used alone or in admixture of two or more.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061">The content of the silicon particles in the silicon-film-forming composition of the present invention can be set at any appropriate value according to a desired film thickness and the like. For example, the content may be set at preferably 1 to 50 wt %, more preferably 5 to 25 wt %, based on the total weight of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">Although the silicon-film-forming composition of the present invention comprises the silicon particles and the dispersion medium as described above, it may also comprise at least one silane compound selected from the group consisting of a hydrogenated linear silane compound represented by a formula:

<p id="p-0064" num="0067">To the silicon-film-forming composition of the present invention, a surfactant may also be added as required in such an amount that does not impair the object and effect of the present invention. Such a surfactant may be a cationic surfactant, an anionic surfactant, an amphoteric surfactant or a nonionic surfactant. Of these, the nonionic surfactant can be preferably used because it improves the wettability of the composition against an object to be coated, improves the leveling property of a coating film and prevents the occurrence of clods or orange skin in the coating film.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0073">In the above embodiment (1), substrates which can be used are not particularly limited. The substrate on which the coating film is formed may have an uneven surface and is not limited to a particular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0074">Specific examples of the material of the substrate include glass, metal, plastic and ceramic. As the glass, quartz glass, borosilicate glass, soda glass, lead glass and lanthanum-based glass can be used, for example. As the metal, gold, silver, copper, nickel, silicon, aluminum, iron and stainless steel can be used, for example. As the plastic, a polyimide, a polyether sulfone, a norbornene-based ring-opened polymer and a hydrogenated norbornene-based ring-opened polymer can be used, for example. Further, these substrates may be in the shape of a block, plate, film or the like and are not limited to a particular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0075">On the above substrate, the coating film of the composition containing silicon particles and a dispersion medium can be formed by coating the composition on the substrate by an appropriate method such as spraying, roller coating, curtain coating, spin coating, wire coating, screen printing, offset printing or ink-jet printing and then removing the dispersion medium.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0076">The coating film forming step is preferably carried out in a non-oxidizing atmosphere. Such an atmosphere can be achieved by preparing an atmosphere containing substantially no oxidizing materials such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. More specifically, a nitrogen atmosphere, a hydrogen atmosphere, a noble gas atmosphere and an atmosphere comprising a mixture of these gases can be preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0077">In the above dispersion medium removing step, the dispersion medium may be left to stand at room temperature so as to evaporate naturally. However, the dispersion medium can be removed more effectively by heating. To heat the dispersion medium in the dispersion medium removing step, it is generally sufficient to heat the dispersion medium at a temperature of about 100 to 400&#xb0; C. for about 1 to 120 minutes by use of an appropriate heating device such as an oven or a hot plate.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0078">The thickness of the coating film varies according to the particle diameters of the silicon particles contained in the silicon-film-forming composition of the present invention. The composition can be coated such that the thickness of the coating film becomes, for example, 0.001 to 10 &#x3bc;m, preferably about 0.01 to 5 &#x3bc;m. The above film thickness should be considered as the film thickness after the dispersion medium is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0079">The thus formed coating film is then subjected to melt-binding, whereby the polysilicon film can be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0080">The melt binding refers to formation of the silicon film by melting at least surfacial portions of the silicon particles contained in the coating film in a short time and binding adjacent silicon particles to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">Such melt binding can be achieved by irradiation of light using a YAG laser, an argon laser, a carbon dioxide gas laser and an excimer laser such as XeF, XeCl, XeBr, KrF, KrCl, ArF and ArCl as a light source in addition to discharge light of a noble gas such as argon, krypton and xenon. As these light sources, light sources with an output of 10 to 5,000 W are preferably used. An output of 100 to 1,000 W is generally sufficient. These light sources preferably have a wavelength of 170 nm to 600 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0082">Further, the melt-binding can also be achieved by emission of flashlight with a pulse width of not larger than 1.5 ms.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0083">Irradiation of the flashlight can be carried out by use of a flashlight discharge lamp (or a flash lamp). As the flashlight discharge lamp, one formed from a quartz glass stick-shaped discharge container containing a noble gas for light emission is used, for example. As the flashlight discharge lamp, one which makes one flashlight at an electric current density of 1.5 to 3.0 kA/cm<sup>2 </sup>is preferably used, for example. An example thereof is disclosed, for example, in JP-A 2001-185088. The flashlight can be irradiated one or more times. The temperature at the time of irradiation can range from &#x2212;273&#xb0; C. to 1,000&#xb0; C., for example. Further, although the atmosphere at the time of the irradiation is not particularly limited, the irradiation is preferably made in a non-oxidizing atmosphere. As the non-oxidizing atmosphere, the same non-oxidizing atmosphere as described above can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0084">In the above embodiment (2), substrates which can be used and a method of forming the coating film of the composition containing silicon particles and a dispersion medium on the substrate are the same as those mentioned in the embodiment (1).</p>

As these light sources, light sources with an output of 10 to 5,000 W are preferably used. An output of 100 to 1,000 W is generally sufficient. The wavelengths of these light sources may be any wavelengths as long as they can be absorbed to some extent by the polysilane compound in the coating film but are preferably 170 nm to 600 nm.</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0123">60 g of the silicon particles obtained in Synthesis Example 2 were dispersed in 340 g of deaerated xylene. This dispersion was coated on a glass substrate in a nitrogen atmosphere by use of a wire coater and dried at 200&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes so as to form a film composed of the silicon particles.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0124">Then, on this film, the coating solution obtained in Synthesis Example 1 was spin-coated, dried at 200&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes and then sintered at 400&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes so as to bind the silicon particles together. The thickness of the thus obtained silicon film was 3.1 &#x3bc;m. When a grid peeling test was carried out for the adhesion of the silicon film, the silicon film remained in all of 100 grids. Further, as a result of XRD analysis, it was found that the silicon showed peaks attributed to (111) at 28.5&#xb0;, (220) at 47.4&#xb0;, (311) at 56.3&#xb0; and (400) at 69.3&#xb0; and was a polycrystal. Further, as a result of ESCA analysis, a peak attributed to metal Si was observed at 99 eV. The resistivity of this silicon film was 2.9&#xd7;10<sup>3 </sup>&#x3a9;cm.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A compact hydrogen generator is coupled to or integrated with a fuel cell for portable power applications. In the process of producing hydrogen for the generator via thermocatalytic decomposition (cracking, pyrolysis) of hydrocarbon fuels in an oxidant-free environment, novel carbon products are produced with filamentary surfaces, &#x201c;octopus&#x201d;-like carbon filaments, single carbon nanotube fibers and the like. Two novel processes are disclosed for the production of carbon filaments and a novel filamentous carbon product useful in the clean-up of oil spills on the surface of water. The apparatus can utilize a variety of hydrocarbon fuels, including natural gas, propane, gasoline, and sulfurous fuels. The hydrogen-rich gas produced is free of carbon oxides or other reactive impurities, so it can be directly fed to any type of a fuel cell. The hydrogen generator can be conveniently integrated with high temperature fuel cells to produce an efficient and self-contained source of electrical power.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a novel portable self-contained power apparatus utilizing a hydrogen generator coupled to or integrated with a fuel cell, and more particularly, relates to a compact hydrocarbon-based hydrogen generator that produces filamentous carbon products and hydrogen gas that can be directly fed to any type of a fuel cell; the invention is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/851,025 filed on May 8, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,653,005, which claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/203,370 filed May 10, 2000, and was funded by U.S. Department of Energy under the contract No. DE-FC336-99GO10456.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recent developments in fuel cell (FC) technology have resulted in compact, light-weight devices having the ability to continuously produce electrical power via electrochemical reactions involving an oxidant (usually, air) and a fuel (most preferably, hydrogen). These devices can potentially replace conventional batteries and are particularly useful for portable electronic systems, space and military (e.g. &#x201c;soldier power&#x201d;) applications, transportation and other systems. However, a compact FC would require a similarly compact and light-weight source of hydrogen. Unfortunately, conventional means of storing hydrogen, including compressed gaseous or liquid hydrogen, as well as, hydrogen cryogenically adsorbed on activated carbons do not lend themselves to use in portable devices. Similarly, the advanced methods of hydrogen storage, such as metal hydrides, catalytically enhanced metal hydrides, carbon nanotubes, also result in relatively low hydrogen storage capacities (below 6 w. %).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To overcome hydrogen storage problems, there have been attempts to produce hydrogen &#x201c;on demand&#x201d;, i.e. generate hydrogen as needed. In this respect, hydrogen generating systems based on the reactions of different metal hydrides with water are most developed. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,459,510 to Litz et al. describe a hydrogen generator which produces hydrogen via the reaction of metal hydride (preferably, sodium borohydride, NaBH<sub>4</sub>) with water. The reaction was enhanced by the presence of metal catalyst (preferably, Raney nickel). Recently, Amendola et al. described a catalytic system for generating hydrogen from aqueous borohydride solutions using a ruthenium catalyst (S. Amendola, M. Binder, M. Kelly, P. Petillo, S. Sharp-Goldman, Advances in Hydrogen Energy, Ed. C. Padro and F. Lau, Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publ., NY, 2000). U.S. Pat. No. 4,155,712 to Taschek and U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,640 to Long et al. deal with portable hydrogen generators based on the hydrolysis and thermal decomposition of metal hydrides (e.g. CaH<sub>2</sub>, LiAlH<sub>4</sub>). The common disadvantages of these systems based on hydrolysis of metal hydrides is the necessity to carry water and, most importantly, the requisite use of expensive metal hydrides which are irreversibly hydrolyzed into metal hydroxides during hydrogen production. Thus, these systems would require handling of metal hydroxide slurries, which would be very difficult, energy intensive and costly to convert back to original hydride form.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To overcome above problems, a variety of hydrocarbons and other hydrogen containing substances (e.g. alcohols) have been widely used as a source of hydrogen. Since hydrocarbon fuels can be obtained from different sources (petroleum or natural gas), they are abundant, cheap and readily available. There has been a significant progress in the area of development of hydrocarbon reformers (or processors) for producing hydrogen or hydrogen-rich gas for fuel cell applications. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,181 to Kim et al. describes a hydrogen generator which is able to produce high purity hydrogen from natural gas and water. The generator comprises a desulfurization reactor, a steam reformer, a CO conversion (or water gas shift, WGS) reactor and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit. Thus, the process includes the following stages:

<br/>
The system also requires a large number of heat exchangers, compressors, valves, etc. The steam reforming (SR) process requires a source of water which adds to the weight of the system. This would result in a bulky system potentially difficult to miniaturize. A similar hydrogen generating apparatus is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,110,559 to Kondo et al. The apparatus consists of a hydrocarbon and air supply systems, a steam generator, a steam reformer, a CO shift converter and gas separation system (PSA). U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,360 to Sederquist discloses an advanced steam reformer with improved distribution of heat within the apparatus. The reformer is applicable to a fuel cell power plant. All these apparatuses are complex and bulky and suffer from the same disadvantages as the previous one. An improved method for producing hydrogen for sulfurous hydrocarbon fuels in the fuel cell electricity generation process is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,717 to Yamase et al. The method is characterized by cracking and desulfurizing petroleum fuels (e.g. kerosene) followed by steam reforming of the desulfurized product. The process is multi-stage, complex and would require an additional source of water. Another multi-stage process for production of hydrogen and energy is described by Engler et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,470. The process is based on partial oxidation of hydrocarbon fuel and includes a reformer, CO-converter and two gas separation units (a membrane and PSA). Partial oxidation (PO) of natural gas (catalytic and non-catalytic) can be described by the following equation:

The apparatus catalytically reforms a hydrogen fuel to a hydrogen rich gas for fueling a fuel cell stack. The device features a cylindrical housing with an axial burner and a helical catalyst tube outside of the burner and inside of the housing. U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,179 to Okamoto describes a steam reformer-fuel cell system, where hydrogen is humidified by the recycled water. U.S. Pat. No. 5,938,800 to Verrill, et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,897,970 to Isomura et al. describe multi-fuel compact reformers for fuel cell applications. Both patents feature a steam reformer coupled with a hydrogen separating membrane (e.g. Pd-based membrane). The use of selective hydrogen membrane allows to avoid bulky PSA system for the separation of gases and can potentially result in smaller units. However, the apparatuses are complex and require to carry a significant amount of water (e.g. in the first patent, 2-4 moles of steam per mole of carbon in the fuel) (although, some amount of water from the exhaust of FC could be recycled to the reactor). U.S. Pat. No. 5,997,594 to Edlund et al. discloses a steam reformer with internal hydrogen purification as a source of high purity hydrogen for a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC). The apparatus includes a steam reformer with internal bulk hydrogen purification and polishing, an integrated combustion method utilizing waste gas to heat the reformer, an efficient integration of heat transfer, resulting in a compact design of the unit. Hydrogen is purified using a thin Pd alloy membrane. A steam-hydrocarbon reformer with a catalytic membrane is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,229,102 to Minet et al. The use of ceramic membrane permeable to hydrogen and carrying catalytically active metallic substance allowed to significantly reduce the maximum temperature of the process and simplify the design.

Nos. 5,366,819; 5,763,114; 5,858,314; 5,641,585; 5,601,937) deal with a hydrogen generator integrated with a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,819 to Hartvigsen et al. discloses a reformer integrated with SOFC. A thermally integrated steam reformer is located inside the stack furnace housing stacks of SOFC. De-sulfurized natural gas as a feedstock was reformed with a steam over Ni- or Ru-based catalysts. Similarly, U.S. Pat.

Light hydrocarbons (e.g. propane and butane) are preferred feedstocks for this apparatus. There are several disadvantages common to all these integrated hydrogen generator-SOFC systems. First of all, very high operating temperatures at which SOFC operate (approx. 1000&#xb0; C.) make them inconvenient for incorporation into small hand-held or other portable devices. Secondly, a preferred feedstock for these devices are desulfurized light hydrocarbon fuels (methane, propane, butane, naphta). The use of heavier hydrocarbon feedstocks (gasoline, diesel fuel, etc.) might promote excessive purification as a source of high purity hydrogen for a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC).

Fourthly, a significant amount of water might be necessary to drive the reformation reaction and to prevent from coke deposits inside the integrated system.

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Development of small fuel reformers based on thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of hydrocarbons for fuel cell applications has been active area of research. The concept is based on a single-step decomposition (cracking, pyrolysis) of hydrocarbons in air/water-free environment. For example, Calahan has developed a fuel reformer to catalytically convert different hydrocarbon fuels to hydrogen which was fed to a 1.5 kW fuel cell (Callahan, M. Proc. 26th Power Sources Symp., Red Bank, N.J., 1974; p.181). A stream of gaseous fuel entered one of two reactor beds, where hydrocarbon decomposition to hydrogen took place at 870-980&#xb0; C. and carbon was deposited on the Ni-catalyst. Simultaneously, air entered the second reactor where the catalyst regeneration by burning coke off the catalyst surface occurred. The streams of fuel and air to the reactors then were reversed for another cycle of decomposition-regeneration. The reported fuel processor did not require WGS and gas separation stages, which was a significant advantage. However, hydrogen was contaminated by carbon oxides which required additional purification step. It was reported most recently on the development of similar hydrocarbon fuel processors based on the catalytic decomposition of natural gas and propane for fuel cell applications (e.g. Pourier, M; Sapundzhiev, C. Intern. Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 1997, v.22, p.429-433). Hydrocarbon feedstock is thermocatalytically decomposed in the reactor at elevated temperatures (900-1000&#xb0; C.) with the production of hydrogen-rich gaseous mixtures and carbon (coke) deposited on the metal (Pd) catalyst surface. After completion of hydrocarbon decomposition stage, air is introduced into the system to burn coke off the catalyst surface. At the heart of the concept is a two-reactor (packed-bed type) system where one reactor is used for hydrocarbon decomposition while the other one is being regenerated. Thus, the whole process runs in a non-steady state regime using complex gas distribution and reagent delivery system. Due to cyclic nature of the process, hydrogen is contaminated with carbon oxides which requires an additional stage of purification using methanator. Furthermore, the above hydrogen generators utilize a number of moving parts, and produce large volumes of CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Several patents are concerned with the use of carbon-based catalysts for decomposition of hydrocarbons into hydrogen and carbon. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,056,602 to Matovich deals with the high temperature apparatus to carry out thermal reactions, including decomposition of hydrocarbons, utilizing fluid wall reactors. Thermal decomposition of methane was conducted at 1260-1871&#xb0; C. utilizing carbon black particles as adsorbents of high flux radiation energy, and initiators of the pyrolytic dissociation of methane. However this apparatus operates at excessively high temperatures and would be very difficult to miniaturize due to its complexity. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,132, Murata et al. claim the process for producing hydrogen from methane and other hydrocarbons by contacting them with fine particles of a carbonaceous material obtained by are discharge between carbon electrodes and having an external surface area of at least 1 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Carbonaceous materials also included soot obtained by thermal decomposition of different organic compounds (or combustion of fuels), carbon nanotubes, activated charcoal, fullerenes C<sub>60 </sub>or C<sub>70</sub>, and finely divided diamond. The optimal conditions for methane conversion included: methane dilution with an inert gas (preferable methane concentration: 0.8-5% by volume), the temperature range of 400-1,200&#xb0; C. and residence times 0.1-50 s. Increase in methane concentration in feedstock from 1.8 to 8 v. % resulted in a drastic drop in methane conversion from 64.6 to 9.7% (at 950&#xb0; C.). Thus, diluted methane feedstock would result in a diluted hydrogen stream which could significantly reduce the efficiency of FC. Also, it was suggested that oxidizing gases like H<sub>2</sub>O or CO<sub>2 </sub>be added to the pyrolyzing zone to improve the catalyst life. However, this would inevitably contaminate hydrogen with carbon oxides and require additional purification step. An International Application No. WO 00/21878 to Arild discloses a method and a device for production of hydrogen and carbon by pyrolysis of natural gas and other organic gases for fuel cell applications. According to this invention, pyrolysis of hydrocarbon feedstock takes place in the reaction chamber with an increasing temperature gradient in the direction of flow from 300 to 2000&#xb0; C. The reaction chamber contains finely distributed carbon dust which acts as a catalyst. Hydrogen is purified by a membrane filter. The growing carbon particles are trapped by means of a mechanical system (e.g. a centrifuge) in the lower part of the reaction chamber, from where a controlled fraction of carbon particles is recycled, crushed and injected to the upper part of the chamber. There are several aspects of this invention that would make it very difficult to produce a compact device. Most difficult is the transporting of a controllable amount of solid carbon from the bottom of the reaction chamber through a crushing device to the upper part of the chamber. Secondly, it would be difficult to control the temperature gradient in the reaction chamber if a heat source other than electric coil will be used to drive the endothermic process. Thirdly, the temperature in the upper part of the reaction chamber is 2000&#xb0; C., which could potentially affect the operation of a closely located membrane. Lastly, the device has many moving parts (e.g. a centrifuge, a carbon crusher, a carbon transporter) which could make it bulky, noisy, and prone to malfunction.</p>

The lack of oxidizers (air and/or water) in the reactor during hydrocarbon decomposition reaction eliminates the production of carbon oxides (CO and CO<sub>2</sub>), and, consequently, need for water gas shift reaction and CO<sub>2 </sub>removal stages required by the reformers based on steam reforming, or partial oxidation, or autothermal reforming. This also eliminates the need for carrying a source of water for the SR and WGS reactors, as well as an equipment to deliver steam (e.g. a water container, a water pump, an evaporator, a heat exchanger, etc.).

<p id="p-0027" num="0030">Reference should now be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which illustrates the inventive concept by providing a simplified cross-sectional schematic diagram of the apparatus. In this embodiment, the apparatus consists of a hydrogen generator (HG) <b>10</b> coupled with a fuel cell stack <b>20</b>. In principle, any type of a fuel cell could be used in the apparatus, e.g. PEFC, or SOFC, or alkaline (AFC), or phosphoric acid (PAFC), or molten carbonate (MCFC) fuel cells. However, the PEFC and SOFC types are preferred, for they: do not include a liquid phase; are insensitive to physical orientation; deliver high power density; and, offer low weights, and, volume. These properties make possible convenient miniaturization for portable applications. HG is shown as a cylindrical stainless steel or ceramic vessel containing coaxially located tubular heating element <b>11</b>, a reaction chamber <b>12</b> filled with a catalytic material (CM) <b>13</b>, and a hydrogen selective membrane <b>14</b>. The reaction chamber wall is made of a porous ceramic (e.g. alumina) tube. CM <b>13</b> is introduced into the reaction chamber via inlet <b>15</b>, and solid carbon product is dislodged from the chamber after the operation from the same inlet <b>15</b>. Hydrocarbon fuel is introduced into the reaction chamber via inlet <b>16</b>. After the reaction chamber is charged with CM <b>13</b> and hydrocarbon fuel, the inlets <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are closed and the apparatus is ready for portable application. Hydrogen gas exits HG via outlet <b>17</b> and enters the anode compartment <b>21</b> of the electrochemical cell <b>22</b>. Air is introduced into the cathode compartment <b>23</b> of the electrochemical cell <b>22</b> via inlet <b>24</b>. The anode and cathode compartments of the electrochemical cell <b>22</b> are separated by a membrane <b>25</b>. FC stack <b>20</b> contains a plurality of electrochemical cells <b>22</b>. Since high purity hydrogen is fed to the anode compartment, FC operates in a &#x201c;dead end&#x201d; mode (i.e. there is no exhaust from <b>21</b>). Oxygen-depleted air stream exits from an outlet <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0031">A number of catalytic materials with surface area greater than 1 m<sup>2</sup>/g (preferably, 100-3000 m<sup>2</sup>/g), e.g. a variety of activated carbons (AC), or silica gel (SG) or activated alumina (AA), or carbon blacks (CB), or chopped carbon fibers, molecular sieves (MS), plain or doped with transition metals, can be used in the device featuring high catalytic activity in hydrocarbon decomposition reaction. CM <b>13</b> can be used in the form of granules or powders with sizes ranging from 0.01 mm to 10 mm (preferably, 0.1-5.0 mm). Gaseous hydrocarbon fuels (e.g. natural gas) are adsorbed onto the surface of CM <b>13</b> at pressures of 1-10 atm. Liquefied petroleum gases (e.g. propane, butane) and all liquid hydrocarbon fuels (e.g. gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel and others) are introduced via inlet <b>16</b> such that they soak into a ceramic fiber <b>18</b> at the lower part the reaction chamber <b>12</b>. During operation of the unit, the heating element is heated to 600-1000&#xb0; C. causing hydrocarbon vapor to decompose over CM <b>13</b> in the reaction zone <b>19</b> with production of hydrogen, methane and other intermediate products (e.g. ethylene). The lower part of the reaction chamber is somewhat cooler that upper part, thus, preventing liquid hydrocarbon fuel from premature evaporation. As hydrocarbon vapor decomposes, the remaining unconverted hydrocarbon fuel rises from the storage area to the reaction zone <b>19</b> by the capillary action. Thus, the lower part of the reaction chamber is utilized as a fuel storage. This eliminates altogether the need for a special fuel storage container, a pump to deliver a fuel to the reaction chamber and a fuel evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0032">The products of hydrocarbon decomposition move to the periphery of the HG <b>10</b>, pass through the porous wall of the reaction chamber and hit the membrane. The advantages of using a membrane in the apparatus are three-fold. Firstly, the use of a membrane allows the production of a high purity hydrogen which can be used in any type of FC, without need for PSA and other gas purification devices. For example, commercial Pd or Pd-Ag membrane produce hydrogen with purity of 99.99% and higher. Alternatively, less expensive hydrogen selective ceramic membranes (e.g. porous alpha and gamma alumina and others) could also be used in the device since all provide a useful hydrogen content of &#x3e;90%. The use of membrane is particularly preferable when gaseous hydrocarbons, e.g. methane, propane, butane, and others, are used as a feedstock in the hydrogen generator. Hydrogen-rich gas produced occupies volumes several times (for liquid fuels, hundreds times) greater than the original hydrocarbon, thus creating driving force for permeation of hydrogen through the membrane. This eliminates the necessity for the use of a compressor or other devices with moving parts, and significantly simplifies the design and greatly improves the compactness of the apparatus. The second advantage of using a membrane relates to the favorable shift in thermodynamic equilibrium of hydrocarbon decomposition reaction. Continuous withdrawal of hydrogen from the reaction zone significantly increases the conversion rate of hydrocarbon feedstock into its constituent elements: hydrogen and carbon. The third advantage of using a membrane is associated with the autocatalytic action of hydrocarbon decomposition reaction in the presence of unsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons are produced as intermediate products during decomposition of all aliphatic hydrocarbons. It has been found by the author of this invention that the decomposition of unsaturated (e.g. ethylene) and aromatic (e.g. benzene and naphthalene) hydrocarbons produces carbon species which are catalytically active in the decomposition of methane, propane and other hydrocarbons. Thus, once started, the process becomes autocatalytic, since intermediate products further catalyze the decomposition process. The role of the membrane is to contain the gaseous mixture of the original hydrocarbons and intermediate products inside the reaction chamber until they are completely dissociated and converted into hydrogen and carbon. The rate of hydrogen production can be conveniently controlled by the temperature of the heating element <b>11</b>, and the opening of valve <b>27</b> located on an outlet <b>17</b>. Partial closing of this valve will increase pressure inside the RC <b>10</b> and slow down hydrocarbon decomposition process and, consequently, hydrogen production rate.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0033">Addition of special dopants (e.g. ZnO, CaO, Zn, Fe etc.) to the catalytic material prevents production of hydrogen sulfide when sulfurous hydrocarbon fuels are used. This particular feature of the device makes it possible to use any type of hydrocarbon fuel and to feed hydrogen-rich gas directly to the fuel cell without additional purification step. Desulfurizing action of the dopants is based on chemical interaction of the dopant with H<sub>2</sub>S at elevated temperatures, for example:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>ZnO+H<sub>2</sub>S&#x2192;ZnS+H<sub>2</sub>O &#x2003;&#x2003;(5)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Fe+H<sub>2</sub>S&#x2192;FeS+H<sub>2 </sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(6)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Alternatively, known in the art Y-type zeolite- or metallosilicate-based adsorbents can also be used for capturing sulfur from the feedstock.
</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0034">In general, hydrocarbon decomposition processes are endothermic in nature. Thus, heat input would be required not only to heat up CM <b>13</b> and a hydrocarbon to the required temperature, but also to drive the endothermic reaction. The amount of thermal energy required to decompose a hydrocarbon molecule depends mostly on the nature of hydrocarbon. It is the highest for methane (37.8 kJ/mole H<sub>2</sub>, hereafter at standard conditions) and it gradually decreases with the increase in the molecular weight of hydrocarbon (e.g. for hexane it is 23.98 kJ/mole H<sub>2</sub>). For unsaturated (e.g. C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) and aromatic (e.g. C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) hydrocarbons, however, the decomposition reactions are exothermic (e.g. for benzene, it is equal to &#x2212;6.6 kJ/mole H<sub>2</sub>,). Decomposition of alkylaromatic hydrocarbons is almost thermoneutral (e.g. for cumene, C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>12 </sub>it is equal to 0.16 kJ/mole H<sub>2</sub>). Let's assume that gasoline with the average formula of C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>16.8 </sub>is used as a feedstock, then decomposition of gasoline into carbon and hydrogen would require 15.9 kJ/mole H<sub>2</sub>. The heat input into the system can be provided by several means: most conveniently, by the electric heating element using part of the electric energy produced by FC. Assuming that the average FC efficiency is 50-60%, then 9.5-11.5% of the total amount of hydrocarbon fuel will be consumed to cover heat input requirements of the apparatus. In this case a small rechargeable battery would be required to initiate the process. Alternatively, the heat input could be supplied by passing electric current through a carbon-based CM (carbon materials are widely used as electric heating elements). In this case two electric wires have to be connected to the upper and lower section of carbon CM <b>13</b> (not shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Heat will be generated using a part (approx. 10-12%) of electric output of the FC. The third way of providing heat to the reaction zone could be via burning part of the hydrocarbon fuel (not shown on the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In this case only 3% of gasoline feedstock will be needed to drive the process.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">In the case where the hydrogen generator is coupled with PEFC which operates at 80%, thermal insulation <b>26</b> would be required to prevent overheating of the FC. The portion of water produced by the FC could be used for humidification of the hydrogen, which is necessary for the normal operation of PEFC (not shown on the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Solid carbon produced during the operation of the apparatus accumulates inside the reaction chamber, therefore provision has to be made to accommodate all the produced carbon inside RC <b>12</b>. After several refueling operations solid carbon can be dislodged from RC <b>12</b>. At ambient temperature carbon is an inert and non-toxic product, so it can be safely disposed. It should be recognized that the foregoing description of the preferred apparatus configuration is merely an example and should not be considered limiting in any manner. For example, hydrocarbon storage could be located outside the RC and delivered to the reaction zone by capillary action, or by gravity or by small pump (not shown on the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> refers to a second preferred embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the function of the membrane is replaced by the use of a special transition metal-based catalyst which increases the hydrogen content of the gas and remove unsaturated hydrocarbons before it enters a fuel cell. Thus, two layers of catalysts are used in this embodiment: the lower (first) layer <b>33</b> is activated carbon, or activated alumina or others; and, the upper (second) layer <b>32</b> is Ni-, or Ni&#x2014;Cu, or Fe- or Co-based catalysts in the form of powder, alumina-supported or in mixture with other oxides or compounds. Both catalytic layers <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> are heated by a heating element <b>34</b> coaxially located in reaction chamber <b>30</b> similar to the first embodiment. In this second embodiment, the wall of RC <b>30</b> is solid (not porous) and could be made of a metal (e.g. stainless steel) or a ceramic. Liquid hydrocarbons (or liquefied petroleum gases) are introduced into RC <b>30</b> from the inlet <b>36</b> and soaked into a ceramic fiber <b>35</b>. The temperature in the layers <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> is maintained between 600-1000&#xb0; C. The operation starts with heating up the heating element <b>34</b> to the required temperature. Hydrocarbon vapors are decomposed over the lower catalytic layer <b>33</b> into the mixture of hydrogen, methane, and higher hydrocarbons. For example, in the case of propane the pyrolysis gas consists of hydrogen, methane, ethylene, ethane, propylene, benzene, naphthalene and others. This gaseous mixture enters the upper catalyst layer <b>32</b> containing, e.g. Ni (10 w. %)/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>catalyst. Hydrocarbon components of the mixture are further decomposed over Ni-catalyst hydrogen and elemental carbon in the form of filaments. The effluent gas exiting the second catalytic layer consists of hydrogen and methane. All unsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbons are effectively decomposed into hydrogen and carbon over the Ni-catalyst. The concentration of hydrogen in the effluent gas depends on the temperature in the catalyst layers and the nature of hydrocarbon. For propane, for example, hydrogen concentration can reach 80-90 v. % with the balance being methane at temperature of 850-900&#xb0; C. Since no carbon oxides are produced in the hydrogen generator, hydrogen-rich gas can be directly fed to a fuel cell <b>40</b> (including PEFC which is prone to deactivation by CO) via the outlet <b>37</b>. Hydrogen is consumed in the anode compartment <b>42</b>, while methane exits via outlet <b>44</b> and can be used to provide heat for the endothermic process. Air enters the cathode compartment <b>43</b> of FC through inlet <b>41</b>, and the oxygen-depleted air exits through outlet <b>45</b>. In case a sulfur-containing fuel is used, a sulfur-capturing dopant should be added to the lower catalytic layer <b>33</b>. Similar to the first embodiment, the hydrogen flow can be controlled by the temperature of the heating element <b>34</b> or by opening the valve <b>39</b>. Also, similar to the first embodiment, the heating element <b>34</b> can be heated by the electric coil, or by passing electrical current through a carbon-based CM <b>33</b>, or by burning part of hydrocarbon fuel. RC <b>30</b> and FC <b>40</b> are separated by an insulator <b>38</b>. It should be recognized that the foregoing description of the preferred apparatus configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is merely an illustrative example and should not be considered limiting in any manner.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">The third preferred embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, relates the thermal and spatial integration of the hydrogen generator with a high temperature fuel cell. MCFC and SOFC operate at temperatures (600-1000&#xb0; C.) which is close to that of hydrogen generator operation; therefore, it would be advantageous to integrate the hydrogen generator with a high temperature FC, particularly, SOFC. The apparatus comprises a reaction chamber <b>50</b> and a fuel cell <b>60</b> mounted into an insulated structure <b>70</b>. A catalytic material <b>53</b> is loaded into RC <b>50</b> via inlet <b>56</b>. CM <b>53</b> is selected from having the properties of high catalytic activity in hydrocarbon decomposition, as well as carbon gasification reactions. Useful CMs <b>53</b> include: Fe catalyst immobilized onto AC or AA, or silica gel; or mixed oxide Fe catalyst. For sulfur-containing fuels, special dopants (ZnO, CaO, Zn, Al, Fe) should be added to CM <b>53</b> to capture H<sub>2</sub>S and other sulfurous impurities and prevent them from entering FC <b>60</b>. A fuel storage <b>51</b> is located outside (on the top) of the insulated box to prevent premature decomposition of hydrocarbons. The fuel storage is connected to RC <b>50</b> via tubing connector <b>52</b> filled with ceramic fiber, such that a hydrocarbon fuel can be delivered to RC by gravity/capillary action. Alternatively, a small pump can be used to deliver the fuel to RC (not shown). Operation of the apparatus starts with the heating up RC <b>50</b> and FC <b>60</b> to the required operational temperature by a heating element (e.g. electrical coil) <b>54</b> wired (<b>550</b>) to a small rechargeable battery <b>55</b> located outside the insulated structure (the battery is needed only to initiate the process). Hydrocarbon vapor is decomposed over CM <b>53</b> producing hydrogen, methane and heavier hydrocarbons (C<sub>2</sub>+) which enter the anode compartment <b>63</b> of FC <b>60</b> via a connector <b>56</b>. Simultaneously, air is introduced into cathode compartment <b>64</b> via inlet <b>65</b>; and the oxygen-depleted air exits via outlet <b>61</b>. Anode and cathode compartments of FC are separated by a membrane <b>62</b>. For the sake of simplicity, only one electrochemical cell is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (FC stack consists of a plurality of electrochemical cells). Hydrogen is oxidized on the anode surface via electrocatalytic reaction producing electrons and water vapor:
<br/>

<br/>
Portion of methane and C<sub>2</sub>+ components of the gaseous mixture are reformed in the high temperature environment of the anode compartment (reaction 1) followed by WGS (reaction 2) producing water and carbon dioxide. The unconverted hydrocarbons are recycled to the RC <b>50</b> by a compressor <b>57</b> via a connector <b>59</b>. Steam and CO<sub>2 </sub>produced in the anode compartment react with carbon deposited on CM <b>53</b> surface according to the following equations:
<br/>

<br/>
Fe-based catalyst catalyzes both carbon gasification reactions. The H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CO mixture along with the hydrogen produced by decomposition of hydrocarbons enter the anode compartment, where they are oxidized on the anode surface into H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2 </sub>and the process continues in a cyclic mode. The process will carry on even after all the hydrocarbon fuel is decomposed, until all the carbon is converted and removed from the CM <b>53</b> surface via gasification reactions. The excessive amount of water vapor produced in the apparatus can be released through valve <b>58</b>. Thus, both hydrogen and carbon constituents of the hydrocarbon fuel will be consumed by FC, resulting in high specific energy of the apparatus. Due to relatively low endothermicity of hydrocarbon decomposition process (compared to steam reforming) the amount of high temperature heat generated by SOFC (rejected heat) is adequate to cover heat input requirements of the hydrogen generator.
</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">According to the third embodiment of the invention, not only hydrocarbons but also solid fuels such as biomass, petroleum coke and even coal can be used as a fuel source for FC. In this case a solid fuel mixed with the catalytic material (e.g. Fe-catalyst) is placed within the reaction chamber. High temperature pyrolysis of biomass results in production of solid carbonaceous product that remains inside RC and a gaseous mixture containing hydrogen, methane, carbon oxides, water and other organic products of biomass pyrolysis. The gaseous products enter the anode compartment of SOFC, where they are oxidized over the anode surface. Water vapor and CO<sub>2 </sub>resulted from these oxidation reactions are recycled back to RC, where they participate in gasification of the solid carbonaceous product generating H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CO mixture. Thus, the process will continue in a cyclic mode until all biomass is consumed. Petroleum coke or coal are mixed with CM (e.g. Fe-based catalyst, or potassium carbonate, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, or their mixture) and, if necessary, sulfur-capturing dopant (e.g. ZnO) and loaded in the RC <b>50</b>. After reaching the required operational temperature, the stream of air (from the same air blower which provides air for a cathode) is introduced into RC <b>50</b> resulting in the production of CO-rich gaseous mixture:

<br/>
CO<sub>2</sub>-rich mixture is recycled to RC <b>50</b>, where it gasifies solid carbonaceous fuel (coke or coal) (Reaction 9) producing CO<sub>2</sub>. The process continues in a cyclic mode until all the solid fuel is consumed by FC. Ash or other residual products from coal or petroleum coke accumulate in RC <b>50</b> and can be dislodged during refueling operation.

<p id="p-0036" num="0039">Thus, the advantages of HG-FC integration include: a) better thermal management of the entire system; b) heat generated by FC drives the endothermic hydrocarbon decomposition reactions, thus, saving 10-15% of a hydrocarbon fuel (which otherwise would be consumed to produce necessary heat); c) both hydrogen and carbon constituents of the hydrocarbon fuel can be utilized, which significantly increases both specific energy and the overall fuel efficiency of the apparatus; d) hydrogen consumption by the anode reduces its partial pressure, thus shifting an equilibrium toward completion of hydrocarbon decomposition reaction; e) the hydrogen generator can operate with minimum moving parts resulting in a quiet apparatus; f) practically, there are no limits for miniaturization of the apparatus; g) the apparatus features a fast response to the load (since there is only one chemical transformation step in HG); and, h) the use of a robust sulfur-resistant catalyst in combination with sulfur-capturing dopant allows the use any type of hydrocarbon fuel, including heavy and sulfur-containing fuels, and solid carbonaceous fuels (biomass, petroleum coke and coal). This is in contrast to prior art portable apparatuses which utilize only light and sulfur-free hydrocarbon feedstocks.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">The fourth embodiment of the present invention relates to the novel carbon product produced during hydrocarbon decomposition (particularly, in the first and second embodiments of the invention). It was discovered by the applicant that at certain conditions, hydrocarbon decomposition resulted in the production of novel form of filamentous carbon. It should be noted that the production of filamentous carbons during catalytic decomposition of different hydrocarbons is well known in the art. Particularly, it is well known that hydrocarbons such as methane, ethylene, acetylene, propylene, benzene in mixtures with hydrogen produce carbon filaments (or carbon nanofibers) upon exposure to transition metal catalysts (e.g. Ni, Ni&#x2014;Cu, Fe, Co) at the temperatures higher than 600&#xb0; C. (e.g. Rodriguez, N. Journal of Materials Research, v.8, 3233, 1993). The diameter of carbon filaments is controlled by the size of the catalyst particle and can vary between 2 and 100 nm. My discovery distinguishes from the prior art in both physical properties and method of production. In the first aspect, carbon filaments produced according to the first embodiment of the invention are approximately 1 micron in mean diameter, &#x201c;octopus&#x201d;-like structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The &#x201c;octopus&#x201d;-like structure consists of a loose, curved, elongated worm shaped, filament or yarn shaped, graphite structure wherein a portion is hollow, tubular and longitudinally uniform (thus, they are one to two orders of magnitude thicker than conventionally produced carbon nanofibers). In the second aspect: they are produced in the presence of carbon-based materials (e.g., carbon black (CB) or activated charcoal (AC)), (in contrast to transition metal catalysts used in the prior art; carbon filaments are preferably produced by decomposition of hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, propane, gasoline) over carbon-based carbonaceous material (CM) by heating it to 850-1200&#xb0; C., preferably, by passing electric current through it.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">Known in the art carbon nanofibers (with the diameter of 2-500 nm) are produced from any hydrocarbon fuel (including heavy sulfurous fuels) by a novel process via hydrocarbon fuel decomposition over two catalytic layers: first (lower) layer being AC, or AA, or SG, or MS mixed with a sulfur-capturing dopant (e.g. ZnO); and second (upper) layer being a transition metal-based catalyst (e.g. Ni-, or Ni&#x2014;Cu-, or Fe-, or Co-based catalyst). Hydrocarbon fuel decomposes and desulfurizes in the first catalytic layer producing a gaseous mixture comprising hydrogen, methane, ethylene, benzene, naphthalene and other components. The gaseous mixture enters the second catalytic layer where further decomposition of hydrocarbons occur with the production of hydrogen and carbon filaments. After completion of the operation, the catalyst is dislodged from the apparatus, and carbon filaments can be separated from the support material by conventional techniques (e.g. sonication).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">Carbon filaments produced by the apparatus can find applications in many traditional areas, e.g. as catalysts and catalyst supports, selective adsorbents, composite materials, reinforcement agents, in energy and hydrogen storage, etc. A novel application for carbon materials produced during operation of the apparatus (concerning first and second embodiment) was discovered by the author of this invention. It was found that carbon products produced by hydrocarbon decomposition over catalytic materials (e.g. AC, CB, Fe-alumina) can be used for the clean-up of oil spills on the surface of water. The invention takes advantage of the combination of two features characteristic of the carbon-product: distinct hydrophobic nature of the carbon surface, and the presence of carbon fibers which act as a hydrophobic &#x201c;sponge&#x201d; and readily adsorb the oil. Scattering of carbon-product particles over the surface of oil spill results in breaking of the oil pellicle and formation of a plurality of oil/carbon isles separated from each other. These isles can be conveniently removed from water surface by &#x201c;brushing&#x201d; with net. The captured oil can be easily retrieved from the oil/carbon slurry using conventional techniques (e.g. press separator). Alternatively, if heavy carbon/support particles (e.g. carbon deposited on Fe-based catalyst) are used for oil spill clean-up, the isles will slowly sink and remain under the water until oil is microbiologically consumed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">The features of the present invention are apparent from the following examples. Examples 1 through 6 demonstrate catalytic action of selected CM in decomposition of different hydrocarbons.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">An activated carbon (CL-20 brand, produced from coconut shells by Barneby Sutcliffe Corp.) in the form of 1 mm granules with the surface area of 1650 m<sup>2</sup>/g was used as a catalytic material. 0.5 g of AC was placed in a quartz tubular reactor (volume 5 ml) with closed end; the reactor was heated by the external electric heater to 500&#xb0; C. and purged with an inert gas (Ar) using a thin (OD 1.6 mm) ceramic tubing reaching the bottom of the reactor in order to remove adsorbed water and entrained air from the catalyst. The reactor cooled to room temperature and 0.2 ml of gasoline was introduced to the bottom of the reactor using the same ceramic tubing such that it soaked into lower catalyst layer. The ceramic tubing was removed and the reactor connected to a gas meter. This was followed by heating the upper part of the catalyst layer to 850&#xb0; C. and slowly moving a heater downward to the bottom of the reactor. The total of 148 ml of gas with the average production rate of 7.5 ml/min was collected in the gas meter with the following composition (v. %): H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;76.25, CH<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;23.75, with traces of C<sub>2</sub><sup>+ </sup>hydrocarbons. Based on the hydrogen yield, the specific energy (SE) achieved in this system was 2.3 kW<sub>th</sub>h per kg of fuel (not including the external source of electric energy). If this reactor is connected with a PEFC (with the efficiency of 50%) SE of the entire power system would be close to 1 kW<sub>el</sub>h per kg of fuel (assuming that 10% of the electric energy output was used to heat up the hydrogen generator). This value of SE is three times higher than that of the advanced methanol/water reformer (300 Wh per kg of fuel) reported in the literature (e.g. Fuel Cell Industry Report, v.1, No.4, 2000).</p>

The reactor was purged with Ar, heated up to 850&#xb0; C. and propane was introduced into the reactor from the bottom at the same flow rate. The composition of the effluent gas was (vol. %): H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;89.77, CH<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;10.23. No other products were detected in the effluent gas. The carbon product deposited on the second catalytic layer was produced in the form of carbon nanofibers 0.1-0.2 micron (which are structurally dissimilar to those depicted on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">EXAMPLE 11 </heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">The experimental conditions are similar to the Example 9, except Ni (55 w. %) on kizelgur (1.0 g) was used as a second catalytic material. The temperature of the second catalytic layer was maintained at 650-700&#xb0; C. The composition of the effluent gas was (vol. %): H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;74.14, CH<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;25.86.

<p id="p-0052" num="0055">Examples 12-14 demonstrate the feasibility of gasification of carbon product produced during decomposition of different hydrocarbons over Fe catalyst. Steam and CO<sub>2 </sub>were used as gasifying agents.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">EXAMPLE 12</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">The experiment was conducted in a tubular quartz reactor (OD 10 mm). Propane was decomposed at 900&#xb0; C. over Fe-catalyst (United Catalyst, C12-4-02) (amount 1.1 g, size of granules 1.5 mm) resulting in the production of hydrogen-rich gas and carbon deposited on catalyst surface in the amount of 0.8 g. After completion of propane decomposition reaction, the reactor was purged with Ar, and steam was introduced into the reactor at the same temperature at the rate of 0.10 g/min. The composition of the effluent gas changed with time. At the beginning its average composition was (vol. %): H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;61.6, CO&#x2014;37.0, CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;1.4. After 20 min the composition of the effluent gas became (vol. %): H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;66.4, CO&#x2014;4.2, CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;29. Over period of 0.5 h practically all carbon was removed from the catalyst surface, and close to 2 L of hydrogen-containing gas was collected.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">EXAMPLE 13 </heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">The experimental conditions are similar to the Example 12, except CO<sub>2 </sub>was used as a gasifying agent. After deposition of carbon (via decomposition of propane) on Fe-catalyst surface, a stream of CO<sub>2 </sub>at the flow rate of 25.0 mL/min was introduced into the reactor. Concentration of CO in the effluent gas at the onset of the process was averaged at 92.0 vol. %, however, after 20-25 min it started to gradually decline as the amount of coke on the catalyst surface diminished. Over a period of 45-50 min practically all carbon was oxidized and removed from the catalyst surface. This resulted in the regeneration of the catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">Example 14 demonstrates the feasibility of using heavy residual oil as a feedstock for the apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">EXAMPLE 14</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">1.0 g of Fe (10 w. %)/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>catalyst doped with 5 w. % of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>in the form of 2 mm granules was placed in the quartz reactor (OD 12 mm). An atmospheric residual oil (with the density of 0.94 g/mL, and sulfur content of 0.3 w. %) was used as a feedstock. No sulfur-capturing dopant was used in this experiment. The reactor was purged with Ar and maintained at 850&#xb0; C. The residual oil was introduced into the upper part of the reactor using a syringe pump and a needle. The gaseous product of pyrolysis consisted of (vol. %): H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;10.2, CH<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;37.4, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>&#x2014;6.2, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;16.2, &#x3a3;C<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;17.1, &#x3a3;C<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;8.1, C<sub>5</sub>+&#x2014;2.3, H<sub>2</sub>S&#x2014;0.5. After pyrolysis, the reactor was purged with Ar and steam was introduced into the reactor at 900&#xb0; C. The composition of the effluent gas was (vol. %): H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;72.4, CO&#x2014;7.9, CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;17.5, CH<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;0.9, H<sub>2</sub>S&#x2014;0.3. Thus, carbon was effectively removed from the catalyst surface via steam gasification reaction with the production of hydrogen-rich gas.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This U.S. non-provisional patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119 of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2006-0011332, filed on Feb. 6, 2006, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention disclosed herein relate to a semiconductor memory device, and more particularly, to a nonvolatile memory device and a method of forming the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, a semiconductor manufacturing process includes a process of forming a desired pattern by removing any unnecessary portions of a layer through a photolithographic patterning process after forming various types of layers on a substrate. A conductive pattern so formed, for example, may take the form of a line-type pattern such as a gate which extends in a predetermined direction, or an island-like conductive pattern such as a bottom electrode of a capacitor. In order to embody a highly integrated device, it is inevitably desired to reduce the width of the conductive pattern, and to shorten the distance between the adjacent conductive patterns. Such reduction of the width of the conductive pattern, however, causes the resistance of the conductive pattern to be increased, and thus, to maintain a lower resistance, it is necessary to form the conductive pattern as thick as possible. In order to form a conductive pattern of increased thickness, an etching process should be performed using a photoresist pattern after forming a thick conductive layer. However, if the conductive layer is too thick, it is difficult to form the conductive pattern with a desired sidewall profile because the photoresist pattern can become somewhat abraded during the etching process. Therefore, to overcome this problem, the thick conductive layer is patterned using a hard mask layer which is harder than the photoresist, wherein the hard mask layer is formed of a nitride layer, an oxide layer or a combination thereof. Due to this hard mask layer, however, the conductive pattern becomes physically higher than the case of using the photoresist pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, as the device becomes more highly integrated, the distance between the adjacent conductive patterns becomes further reduced, whereas the thickness of each conductive pattern is further increased. As a result, the region between the adjacent patterns has a small width and a large height. That is, the region has high aspect ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, an interlayer insulating layer is commonly filled into the region between the adjacent conductive patterns for insulating the adjacent conductive patterns from each other. However, since this region has a high aspect ratio as described above, it is difficult to fill the interlayer insulating layer into this region sufficiently so that there may exist a void in the interlayer insulating layer. When a void is present in the interlayer insulating layer, the adjacent conductive patterns can become electrically connected to each other when later performing a contact-forming process of patterning the interlayer insulating layer and depositing conductive material thereon. Accordingly, it is difficult to secure device reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it becomes necessary to remove the hard mask used in forming the conductive pattern. Particularly, in manufacturing a nonvolatile memory device in which a memory cell has a stacked gate structure, it is essential to be able to remove the hard mask through a relatively simple process because the thickness of the layer to be patterned is too great and the region between the adjacent stacked gate structures has a high aspect ratio.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Embodiments of the present invention relate to a process of removing a mask used in forming a conductive pattern in a method of forming a semiconductor memory device, and more particularly, to a process of removing a mask used in forming a memory cell with a stacked gate structure in forming a method of forming a memory device such as a nonvolatile memory device. For the sake of illustrative convenience, descriptions will be focused on a method of forming a flash memory device having a stacked gate structure configured with a tunneling insulating layer, a floating gate operating as a memory layer, a gate interlayer insulating layer, and a control gate operating as a word line.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hereinafter, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a NOR flash memory device according to one embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic perspective view illustrating a cell structure of memory cells constituting the NOR flash memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3C</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views illustrating the NOR flash memory of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in detail, which are taken along lines I-I&#x2032;, II-II&#x2032;, and III-III&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a NOR flash memory device includes a plurality of memory cells (MC) arranged in a matrix form. Sources <b>1100</b><i>s </i>of each memory cell arranged in a row direction (x) are connected through a source connection unit <b>1100</b><i>sc</i>, thereby forming a common source line (CS/L) <b>1100</b>. Drains <b>1200</b> of each memory cell arranged in a column direction (y) are connected to a bit line (B/L) extending in the column direction. The common source lines (CS/L) <b>1100</b>, for example, are electrically connected to a source line (S/L) which extends in the column direction. Control gates <b>750</b> of each memory cell arranged in the row direction is connected to each other so as to form a word line extending in the row direction.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A memory cell structure of the NOR flash memory according to one embodiment of the present invention will be illustrated more fully with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3C</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the memory cell includes a stacked gate structure <b>900</b>, a source <b>1100</b><i>s </i>and a drain <b>1200</b> disposed at respective sides of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b>. The stacked gate structure <b>900</b> of the memory cell is configured with a tunnel insulating layer <b>450</b>, a floating gate <b>550</b> operating as a memory layer, a gate interlayer insulating layer <b>650</b>, and a control gate <b>750</b> operating as a word line. The stacked gate structures <b>900</b>, which are adjacent to each other in the column direction, may share a common source <b>1100</b><i>s </i>positioned between them. In addition, the adjacent stacked gate structures <b>900</b> arranged in the column direction may share a common drain <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An interlayer insulating layer <b>1300</b> is formed to cover the uppermost surface of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b>, i.e., the uppermost surface of the control gate <b>750</b>. A bit line <b>1600</b> is on the interlayer insulating layer <b>1300</b> and is electrically connected to the drain <b>1200</b> through a contact plug <b>1400</b> penetrating through the interlayer insulating layer <b>1300</b>. A source line <b>1700</b> is electrically connected to the common source line <b>1100</b> through a contact plug <b>1500</b> which penetrates through the interlayer insulating layer <b>1300</b>. The source line <b>1700</b>, for example, may be in contact with the source <b>1100</b><i>s </i>of the common source line <b>1100</b> or with the source connection unit <b>1100</b><i>sc</i>. In the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the source line <b>1700</b> is shown as being electrically connected to the source <b>1100</b><i>s </i>of common source line <b>1100</b>. In addition, although it is illustrated that the source line <b>1700</b> seems to be formed at a level that is the same height as the bit line <b>1600</b>, the source line <b>1700</b> may be at a level that is higher or lower than the bit line <b>1600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The drains <b>1200</b> adjacent to each other in the row direction are insulated from each other by means of a device isolation region <b>300</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the sources <b>1100</b><i>s </i>adjacent to each other in the row direction are connected to each other through the source connection unit <b>1100</b><i>sc </i>to thereby form the common source line <b>1100</b>. The common source line <b>1100</b> may be formed by removing a portion of the substrate between source regions and implanting impurity ions onto both the source regions and the exposed region of the substrate by removing the portion of the substrate. Accordingly, a bottom surface of the source connection unit <b>1100</b><i>sc </i>is lower than that of the device isolation region <b>300</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Methods of fabrication will be set forth more fully with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 12A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B through 12B</figref>. Herein, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 12A</figref> are cross-sectional views taken along lines I-I&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B through 12B</figref> are cross-sectional views taken along lines II-II&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> is a perspective view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> is a perspective view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the device isolation region <b>300</b> is formed on the substrate <b>100</b> through a device isolation process, wherein the device isolation region <b>300</b> extends in the column direction. Thus, an active region is defined between the device isolation regions <b>300</b>. The device isolation region <b>300</b>, for example, may be formed through the following steps. The substrate <b>100</b> can be etched to a predetermined depth so as to form a trench therein. Thereafter, an insulating material such as silicon oxide or the like can be filled into the trench <b>200</b> to thereby form the device isolation region <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, a tunneling insulating layer <b>400</b> and a first conductive layer <b>500</b> for forming a floating gate are formed on the active region in sequence. The first conductive layers <b>500</b> extend in the column direction, and the device isolation regions <b>300</b> are disposed between the first conductive layers <b>500</b>. The first conductive layer <b>500</b>, for example, may be formed on the active region such that one conductive layer <b>500</b> is electrically isolated from other conductive layers <b>500</b> adjacent thereto in the row direction by forming a silicon layer on the tunneling insulating layer <b>400</b> and the device isolation region <b>300</b> and then patterning the silicon layer. The first conductive layer <b>500</b> can extend over the device isolation region <b>300</b> adjacent the active region. The tunneling insulating layer <b>400</b>, for example, can be formed of silicon oxide using a thermal oxidation process or a vapor deposition process.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Herein, the tunneling insulating layer <b>400</b> and the first conductive layer <b>500</b> can be patterned simultaneously with the device isolation region <b>300</b>. That is, the tunneling insulating layer and the silicon layer are deposited on the substrate <b>100</b> in sequence and patterned into predetermined configurations, thereby forming a trench etch mask in which the tunneling insulating layer <b>400</b> and the first conductive layer <b>500</b> are stacked in sequence. Herein, the trench etch mask covers a predetermined region of the substrate which will become an active region, and exposes a region which will become a trench. Thereafter, the substrate <b>100</b> is etched using the trench etch mask to thereby form the trench <b>200</b>. Subsequently, an insulating material is filled into the trench <b>200</b> so as to form the device isolation region <b>300</b>. Therefore, the first conductive layer <b>500</b> is formed on the active region in a self-aligned manner.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, the first conductive layer <b>500</b> may optionally be configured with a lower silicon pattern and an upper silicon pattern. In other words, after the tunneling insulating layer and the lower silicon layer are deposited on the substrate in sequence, they are patterned into a predetermined shape so as to form a trench etch mask in which the tunneling insulating layer <b>400</b> and the lower silicon pattern are stacked in sequence. The trench etch mask covers a predetermined region of the substrate <b>100</b> which will become an active region; and exposes a region which will become a trench. Thereafter, the substrate <b>100</b> is etched using the trench etch mask to thereby form the trench <b>200</b>. Subsequently, an insulating material is filled into the trench <b>200</b> so as to form the device isolation region <b>300</b>. Therefore, the lower silicon pattern is formed on the active region in a self-aligned manner. After forming the upper silicon layer on the lower silicon pattern and the device isolation region, they are patterned so as to form an upper silicon pattern on the lower silicon pattern. Thus, formation of the first conductive layer <b>500</b> is completed. In alternative embodiments, the upper silicon pattern can optionally also be formed on the side surfaces of the lower silicon pattern in addition to the top surface thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, a gate interlayer insulating layer <b>600</b> and a second conductive layer <b>700</b> for use in forming a control gate are formed on the first conductive layer <b>500</b> and the device isolation region <b>300</b> in sequence. Afterwards, a hard mask <b>800</b> is formed on the second conductive layer <b>700</b>, wherein the hard mask <b>800</b> extends in the row direction and defines the control gate. The gate interlayer insulating layer <b>600</b>, for example, may be formed of an ONO layer in which an oxide layer, a nitride layer, and an oxide layer are stacked in sequence. The second conductive layer <b>700</b>, for example, may be formed of a silicon layer, silicide, or combinations thereof. Herein, the application of silicide operates to reduce the resistance of the word line.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The hard mask <b>800</b> may be formed of any material which does not have an etch selectivity with respect to the device isolation region <b>300</b>. For example, the hard mask <b>800</b> may be formed of silicon oxide. Herein, a material that does not have etch selectivity with respect to another material means that the materials exhibit substantially at the same etch rate when etching both materials using a predetermined etch gas or etch solution.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the second conductive layer <b>700</b>, the gate interlayer insulating layer <b>600</b>, the first conductive layer <b>500</b> and the tunneling insulating layer <b>400</b> are etched using the hard mask <b>800</b> as an etch mask until the active region and the device isolation region are exposed, thereby forming a stacked gate structure <b>900</b> of a memory cell under the hard mask <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The stacked gate structure <b>900</b> is configured to include the patterned tunneling insulating layer <b>450</b>, the floating gate <b>550</b>, the gate interlayer insulating layer <b>650</b>, and the control gate <b>750</b> over the active region, as illustrated above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Meanwhile, over the device isolation region <b>300</b>, the stacked gate structure <b>900</b> is configured with the gate interlayer insulating layer <b>650</b> and the control gate <b>750</b> which are stacked in sequence, as illustrated above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Herein, the active regions <b>930</b> and <b>950</b> disposed at respective sides of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b> are regions where a source and drain will be formed, respectively. Furthermore, the region <b>950</b> where the source will be formed (hereinafter, referred to as a source region <b>950</b>) and a source connection region <b>970</b> corresponding to removed portions of the device isolation region <b>300</b> are provided as a common source line region <b>990</b> where a common source line will be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 8C</figref>, an etch mask <b>1000</b> is formed for forming a self-aligned source line such that the common source line region <b>990</b> is exposed but the region <b>930</b> where the drain will be formed (hereinafter, referred to as a drain region) is covered. Alternatively, if a portion of the drain region <b>930</b> is exposed, the device isolation region <b>300</b> between adjacent drains <b>120</b> may be also removed during a subsequent process so that adjacent drains may be connected to each other. Therefore, in consideration of error of photolithographic process, it is preferable that the etch mask <b>1000</b> for the self-aligned source should be formed on the top surface of the hard mask <b>800</b> adjacent to the drain region <b>930</b> as well as on the drain region <b>930</b> so that the etch mask <b>1000</b> completely covers the drain region <b>930</b>. That is, the etch mask <b>1000</b> for the self-aligned source partially covers the top surface of the hard mask <b>800</b> adjacent to the drain region <b>930</b> and partially exposes the top surface of the hard mask <b>800</b> adjacent to the common source line region <b>990</b>. The etch mask <b>1000</b>, for example, may be formed through an exposure and development process after coating the photosensitive material, e.g., photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A through 9C</figref>, an etching process is performed using the etch mask <b>1000</b> to thereby expose the entire top surface of the hard mask <b>800</b>. As a result, a remaining etch mask <b>1010</b> completely covers the drain region <b>930</b> but exposes the common source line region <b>990</b> and the top surface of the hard mask <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to the embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to readily form the remaining etch mask <b>1010</b> which exposes both the common source line region <b>990</b> and the entire top surface of the hard mask <b>800</b> by means of the etching process without the need for an additional photolithographic process, after forming the etch mask <b>1000</b> for the self-aligned source through the deposition, exposure and development process of the photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Herein, the etching of the etch mask <b>1000</b> may be performed using dry etching, wet etching, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), etc. The dry etching, for example, may be performed using oxygen plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The device isolation region <b>300</b> positioned between neighboring source regions <b>950</b> is removed from the common source line region <b>990</b>. At this time, the hard mask <b>800</b> formed on the stacked gate structure <b>900</b> is removed at the same time. Therefore, the device isolation region <b>300</b> disposed at one side of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b> is removed so that the substrate <b>100</b> has a convex-concave profile, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, after removing the remaining etch mask <b>1010</b> for the self-aligned source, an ion implantation process is performed to thereby form the common source line <b>1100</b> and the drain <b>1200</b>. The common source line <b>1100</b> is formed along the convex-concave profile of the substrate <b>100</b> which is disposed at one side of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b>. The common source line <b>1100</b> may be divided into two portions, i.e., a source <b>1100</b><i>s </i>and a source connection unit <b>1100</b><i>sc </i>for connecting adjacent source lines <b>1100</b><i>s </i>to each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. That is, the impurity ions are implanted onto the active region <b>950</b> at one side of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b> so as to form the source <b>1100</b><i>s</i>. Meanwhile, the impurity ions are implanted onto the source connection region <b>970</b> where the device isolation region <b>300</b> has been removed so that the source connection unit <b>1100</b><i>sc </i>is formed at the source connection region <b>970</b>. The drain <b>1200</b> is formed on the active region <b>930</b> at the other side of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The ion implantation process may optionally be formed before forming the etch mask <b>1000</b> for the self-aligned source. That is, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the source and drain may be formed on the active region disposed at the respective sides of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b> by performing an ion implantation process. Subsequently, the forming of the etch mask <b>1000</b> for the self-aligned source, the etching process of the etch mask <b>1000</b>, and the removal process of the device isolation region <b>300</b> and the hard mask <b>800</b> are performed in sequence, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 8C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A through 9C</figref>. Afterward, the impurity ions are implanted using the remaining etch mask <b>1010</b> to thereby form the source connection unit <b>1100</b><i>sc </i>which connects the adjacent sources <b>1100</b><i>s </i>to each other. As a result, the common <b>1100</b> source line is completed. Herein, the impurity ions may be additionally implanted onto the source <b>1100</b><i>s </i>which has been formed in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, the drain <b>1200</b> may optionally be formed after forming the common source line <b>1100</b>. That is, before removing the remaining etch mask <b>1010</b> for the self-aligned source, the impurity ions are implanted to thereby form the common source line <b>1100</b>. Subsequently, the remaining etch mask <b>1010</b> for the self-aligned source is removed, and thereafter, the impurity ions are implanted to form the drain <b>1200</b>. During the ion implantation process for forming the drain <b>1200</b>, the impurity ions may be additionally implanted onto the exposed common source line <b>1100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, an insulating material such as silicon oxide is deposited to form an interlayer insulating layer <b>1300</b>. According to the embodiment of the present invention, since the hard mask <b>800</b> does not remain on the top surface of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b>, the height of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b> becomes smaller so that it is possible to form the interlayer insulating layer <b>1300</b> between neighboring stacked gate structures <b>900</b> without a void. The interlayer insulating layer <b>1300</b> is in contact with the control gate <b>750</b>, which is the uppermost layer of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, the interlayer insulating layer <b>1300</b> is patterned into a predetermined configuration so as to form a contact hole exposing the drain <b>1200</b> and the common source line <b>1100</b>. Thereafter, a conductive layer is formed inside the contact hole and over the interlayer insulating layer <b>1300</b>. Afterwards, the conductive layer is patterned so as to form a bit line <b>1600</b> and a source line <b>1700</b>. The bit line <b>1600</b> is electrically connected to the drain <b>1200</b> through a contact plug <b>1400</b>, wherein the contact plug <b>1400</b> penetrates through the interlayer insulating layer <b>1300</b>. Meanwhile, the source line <b>1700</b> is electrically connected to the common source line <b>1100</b> through a contact plug <b>1500</b> which penetrates through the interlayer insulating layer <b>1300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 through 15</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views illustrating a method of forming a nonvolatile memory device according to another embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 through 15</figref>, capital letters A and B denote a memory cell region and a peripheral circuit region B, respectively. The memory cell region A may be a region where NOR flash memory cells will be formed as described above. In addition, the peripheral circuit region B may be a region where a drive transistor required for driving the memory cell will be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the aforementioned processes are performed over the memory cell region A to thereby form a stacked gate structure <b>900</b> which is protected by a hard mask <b>800</b>. On the other hand, a drive gate structure <b>350</b> is formed on the peripheral circuit region B, wherein the drive gate structure <b>350</b> is protected by a capping layer <b>870</b>. The drive gate structure <b>350</b> includes a gate insulating layer <b>470</b> and a drive gate <b>770</b> which are stacked on the substrate <b>100</b> in sequence. Since a floating gate and a drive gate interlayer insulating layer are not formed in the drive gate structure <b>350</b> of the peripheral circuit region B, the drive gate structure <b>350</b> is at a height that is lower than that of the stacked gate structure <b>900</b> disposed in the memory cell region A. The drive gate <b>770</b> of the peripheral circuit region B may be formed out of the first conductive layer used for forming the floating gate <b>550</b> of the memory cell region A; Alternatively, the drive gate <b>770</b> may be formed out of the second conductive layer for forming the control gate <b>750</b> of the memory cell region.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an etch mask <b>1000</b> for the self-aligned source is formed such that a common source line region is exposed. The etch mask <b>1000</b> for the self-aligned source covers the drive gate structure <b>350</b> of the peripheral circuit region B.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a portion of the etch mask <b>1000</b> is removed such that the top surface of the hard mask <b>800</b> of the memory cell region A is entirely exposed, as stated above. At this time, it is noted that the capping layer <b>870</b> of the drive gate structure <b>350</b> of the peripheral circuit region B is not exposed. That is, since the drive gate structure <b>350</b> is lower than the stacked gate structure <b>900</b>, the portion of the etch mask <b>1000</b> over the capping layer <b>870</b> of the peripheral circuit region B still remains so as to protect the capping layer <b>870</b> even though the portion of the etch mask <b>1000</b> that lies over the hard mask <b>800</b> of the memory cell region A is completely removed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Thereafter, the device isolation layer formed on the common source line region of the memory cell region A is removed using the remaining etch mask <b>1010</b> as a mask for the removal procedure. At this time, the top surface of the hard mask <b>800</b> of the memory cell region A is completely exposed, and thus the hard mask <b>800</b> is removed at the same time as the device isolation layer. However, the remaining etch mask <b>1010</b> still remains on the top surface of the capping layer <b>870</b> of the peripheral circuit region B so that the capping layer <b>870</b> is not etched.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to the present invention, the interlayer insulating layer can be formed between neighboring stacked gate structures while minimizing the likelihood of voids being formed therein so that it is possible to form a reliable semiconductor device, e.g., particularly a reliable nonvolatile memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to an inventive method of forming the nonvolatile memory device, since it is possible to easily remove the hard mask for forming the stacked gate structure of the nonvolatile memory device without any supplementary photolithographic process, it is possible to shorten a process time. In addition, it is possible to form the nonvolatile memory device economically without any supplementary photolithographic process in a short process time.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">While the invention have been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a method for fabrication metal-oxide semiconductor transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With progress in the semiconductor industry, performance and economic factors of integrated circuit design and manufacture have caused a scale of devices in integrated circuits to be drastically reduced to miniaturized sizes, increasing density on a chip. However, a short channel effect, which results in a poor threshold voltage roll-off characteristic, always accompanies miniaturization. To avoid this problem, industries have provided a method for forming lightly doped drains (LDDs) having an ultra shallow junction as a solution.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a conventional ultra shallow junction formation, a low energy ion implantation process is performed in a shallow surface of a substrate adjacent to two sides of a gate structure, a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process is then performed to form a junction profile. However, as device scale is reduced to 90-nm and smaller, the conventional ultra shallow junction formation hits a limitation in depth control, and co-implantation performed in cooperation with pre-amorphorization (PAI) and laser annealing seems to be able to satisfy demands down to 65-nm and even 45-nm processes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> illustrate a method of utilizing pre-amorphorized implantation process for fabricating a p-type metal-oxide semiconductor (PMOS) transistor having ultra-shallow junction according to the prior art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> having a gate structure <b>102</b> thereon is provided, in which the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> can be a semiconductor wafer or a silicon on insulator substrate. The gate structure <b>102</b> includes a gate dielectric <b>104</b> and a gate <b>106</b> disposed on the gate dielectric <b>104</b>. Next, a pre-amorphorized implantation process is conducted by injecting atoms such as antimony (Sb) or germanium (Ge) into the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. The pre-amorphorized implantation specifically disrupts the lattice structure of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> and forms an amorphorized region <b>108</b> in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an ion implantation process is performed by implanting a p-type dopant such as boron (B) or boron fluoride (BF<sub>2</sub>) into the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> surrounding the gate structure <b>102</b>. A rapid thermal annealing process is conducted thereafter to form a lightly doped drain <b>110</b> having ultra-shallow junction of a PMOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a spacer <b>112</b> is formed on the sidewall of the gate structure <b>102</b>. Next, another ion implantation process is performed to inject a p-type dopant with higher concentration into the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> surrounding the spacer <b>112</b>. The p-type dopant can be the aforementioned boron or boron fluoride. Another rapid thermal annealing process is performed thereafter by using a temperature between 950 degrees to 1000 degrees to activate the dopants and form a source/drain region <b>114</b> in the semiconductor substrate <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It should be noted that despite the fact that the conventional pre-amorphorized implantation process can be conducted to achieve ultra-shallow junctions by injecting non-doping ions for inhibiting the diffusion of dopants implanted thereafter, the implantation process also creates significant interstitial defects while using the implanted ions to damage the lattice structure of the silicon substrate. Specifically, the interstitial defects become diffusion paths for dopants such as boron and ultimately causes a transient enhanced diffusion effect. This transient enhanced diffusion effect not only deepens the junction profile but also makes the distribution of the dopant not sheer in the lateral direction, resulting in an end of range dislocation phenomenon and a severe short channel effect.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an objective of the present invention to provide a method for fabricating a metal-oxide semiconductor transistor for solving the aforementioned problems.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A method for fabricating a metal-oxide semiconductor transistor is disclosed. First, a semiconductor substrate having a gate structure thereon is provided, and a spacer is formed around the gate structure. An ion implantation process is performed to implant a molecular cluster containing boron into the semiconductor substrate surrounding the spacer for forming a source/drain region. The weight ratio of each boron atom within the molecular cluster is preferably less than 10%. Thereafter, a millisecond annealing process is performed to activate the molecular cluster within the source/drain region.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention specifically implants a molecular cluster containing boron into the semiconductor substrate for forming an ultra-shallow junction while eliminating the needs of performing any pre-amorphorized implantation.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> illustrate a method for fabricating a PMOS transistor according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a semiconductor substrate <b>200</b> having a gate structure <b>202</b> thereon is provided, in which the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b> can be a semiconductor wafer or a silicon on insulator substrate. The gate structure <b>202</b> includes a gate dielectric <b>204</b> and a gate <b>206</b> disposed on the gate dielectric <b>204</b>. The gate dielectric <b>204</b> is preferably composed of insulating materials such as silicon dioxide and the gate <b>206</b> is composed of conductive materials such as doped polysilicon.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an ion implantation process is performed by injecting large molecular ions or clustered ions having p-type dopants into the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b> surrounding the gate structure <b>204</b> to form a lightly doped drain <b>210</b>. Preferably, the molecular ions can be a molecular cluster having boron therein. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the molecular cluster injected into the substrate includes B<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y </sub>and C<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub>H<sub>z</sub>. Specifically, B<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y </sub>can be B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14 </sub>or B<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22 </sub>and the weight ratio of each boron atom within B<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y </sub>is less than 10%. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the molecular weight of the molecular cluster is greater than 100.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a spacer <b>212</b> is formed around the gate structure <b>202</b>. Another ion implantation process is conducted thereafter by injecting a molecular cluster having boron therein into the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b> surrounding the spacer <b>212</b>. This ion implantation process specifically forms a source/drain region <b>214</b> around the lightly doped drain <b>210</b>. According to the aforementioned composition of the injected dopants, the molecular weight of the molecular cluster is greater than 100, in which the molecular cluster injected into the substrate includes B<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y </sub>and C<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub>H<sub>z</sub>. Preferably, B<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y </sub>can be B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14 </sub>or B<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22 </sub>and the weight ratio of each boron atom within B<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y </sub>is less than 10%.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It should be noted that the present invention specifically implants a molecular cluster having significantly large molecular weight into the semiconductor substrate for forming the lightly doped drain and the source/drain region. The injected molecular cluster preferably has boron therein and includes a molecular weight of 100 or above. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the weight ratio of each boron atom within the molecular cluster is less than 10%. Since the weight ratio of each boron atom within the molecular cluster is significantly less than the weight ratio of each boron atom within the conventional dopants, each boron atom of the present invention would have a much smaller energy distribution during the implantation process, thus forming a much shallower junction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other words, the present invention aims to provide a method for fabricating ultra-shallow junctions. Preferably, the process for fabrication ultra-shallow junctions can be achieved by implanting a molecular cluster having large molecular weight into the semiconductor substrate without conducting any pre-amorphorized implantation process. By eliminating the needs for conducting a pre-amorphorized implantation process, the present invention thus prevents various drawbacks caused by the pre-amorphorized implantation, such as generating significant interstitial defects, transient enhanced diffusion, or end of range dislocation phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">After the formation of the source/drain region, a millisecond annealing process can be performed by using a temperature between 1100 degrees to 1500 degrees to activate the molecular cluster within the source/drain region. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the millisecond annealing process can be a laser annealing process or a flash annealing process, in which the duration of the millisecond annealing process is between 100 milliseconds to 1 microsecond.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the junction depth and dopant concentration while using dopants of different molecular weight and different fabrication parameters for fabricating ultra-shallow junctions according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, after a pre-amorphorized implantation process is conducted, a dopant containing boron fluoride (BF<sub>2</sub>) having smaller molecular weight is implanted into the semiconductor substrate with an implantation energy of 4 KeV, and a rapid thermal annealing process is performed to activate the injected dopant, a junction with depth of approximately 35 nm to 50 nm is formed. By using the present process of injecting a boron-contained molecular cluster having large molecular weight with an implantation energy of 6 KeV into the semiconductor substrate without conducting any pre-amorphorized implantation process and performing a rapid thermal annealing process to activate the implanted molecular cluster, a junction with similar depth of approximately 35 nm to 50 nm can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be noted that since the weight ratio of a boron atom within BF<sub>2 </sub>is approximately 22.15%, the boron atom would distribute energy of 0.886 KeV when BF<sub>2 </sub>is implanted into the semiconductor substrate with implantation energy of 4 KeV. On the other hand, since the weight ratio of a boron atom within B<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22 </sub>is approximately 4.99%, the boron atom would distribute energy of 0.299 KeV when B<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22 </sub>is implanted into the semiconductor substrate with implantation energy of 6 KeV. In other words, by implanting a molecular cluster having a boron weight ratio much smaller than the conventional dopants, thus having a much smaller distributing energy for each boron atom, the present invention is able to form a much shallower junction within the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">By following the aforementioned process, the present invention principally utilizes a molecular cluster having large molecular weight to replace the conventional dopants implanted into the semiconductor substrate while eliminating the needs for conducting any pre-amorphorized implantation process. Specifically, the molecular cluster injected into the substrate includes molecules such as B<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22</sub>, which are utilized for replacing the conventional dopants having smaller molecular weight, such as BF<sub>2</sub>. After the molecular cluster is implanted into the semiconductor substrate, an ultra-shallow junction can be formed. By using this method, the present invention is able to obtain a junction depth equal to the one achieved by using the conventional pre-amorphorized implantation with the combination of the BF<sub>2 </sub>dopant while preventing various problems brought by the pre-amorphorized implantation process.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the relative resistance and junction depth measured while using either rapid thermal annealing process or laser annealing process for implanting B<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22 </sub>into a substrate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when a laser annealing process is performed in combination with the implantation of B<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22</sub>, a junction shallower than the one achieved from using the rapid thermal annealing process can be obtained. Hence, if the present invention first implants a molecular cluster having large molecular weight, such as B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14 </sub>or B<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22 </sub>into the semiconductor substrate and conducting a millisecond annealing process thereafter to activate the injected molecular cluster, a junction shallower than the one achieved by using the conventional pre-amorphorized implantation and BF<sub>2 </sub>doping can therefore be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Overall, in contrast to the conventional means of performing a pre-amorphorized implantation process with combination of an ion implantation utilizing p-type dopant having relatively smaller molecular weight, the present invention specifically implants a molecular cluster containing boron into the semiconductor substrate for forming an ultra-shallow junction while eliminating the needs of performing any pre-amorphorized implantation. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the implanted molecular cluster is composed of molecules having large molecular weight, such as B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14 </sub>or B<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22</sub>, in which the weight ratio of each boron atom within the molecular cluster is less than 10%. Thereafter, a millisecond annealing process can be conducted to activate the implanted molecular cluster. By implanting a molecular cluster having a boron weight ratio much smaller than the conventional dopants, thus having a much smaller distributing energy for each boron atom, the present invention is able to form a much shallower junction within the substrate. Additionally, by eliminating the needs of conducting any pre-amorphorized implantation process while forming ultra-shallow junctions, the present invention is able to prevent various drawbacks caused by the pre-amorphorized implantation process, including interstitial defects generated by the impact of dopants injected into the lattice structure of the silicon substrate, transient enhanced diffusion caused by rapid boron diffusion during a rapid thermal annealing process, or end of range dislocation phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention. Accordingly, the above disclosure should be construed as limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to fluorinated compounds containing short perfluorinated alkyl chains that are useful as organogelators and surface treatment materials to provide oil- and water-repellency properties to substrates.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various compositions are known to be useful as treating agents to provide surface effects to substrates. Surface effects include repellency to moisture, soil, and stains, and other effects, which are particularly useful for fibrous substrates and other substrates such as hard surfaces. Many such treating agents are fluorinated polymers or copolymers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most commercially available fluorinated polymers useful as treating agents for imparting repellency to substrates contain predominately eight or more carbons in the perfluoroalkyl chain to provide the desired repellency properties. Honda et al, in Macromolecules, 2005, 38, 5699-5705 disclose that for perfluoroalkyl chains of greater than 8 carbons, orientation of the R<sub>f </sub>groups is maintained in a semi-crystalline configuration while for such chains having less than 6 carbon atoms, reorientation occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various attempts have been made to improve particular surface effects and to increase the fluorine efficiency; i.e., boost the efficiency or performance of treating agents so that lesser amounts of the expensive fluorinated polymer are required to achieve the same level of performance or have better performance using the same level of fluorine. It is desirable to reduce the chain length of the perfluoroalkyl groups thereby reducing the amount of fluorine present, while still achieving the same or superior surface effects. Use of shorter chain perfluoroalkyl groups is one way to reduce the amount of fluorine present. Other approaches provide alternative mechanisms for structure and ordering in the fluorinated materials having short fluorinated tails. For instance, one approach is to combine the characteristics of structures known to undergo gelation via, for instance, hydrogen bonding, with short perfluorinated alkyl moieties. The ordering imposed upon the perfluorinated alkyl groups by the hydrogen bonding networks may amplify the ability of the perfluorinated alkyl moieties to order, thus increasing the fluorine efficiency of surface treating agents comprising such structures.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a continuing need for compositions that improve the repellency and stain resistance of treating agents for fibrous and/or porous substrates and hard surface substrates while using lower levels of fluorine. The present invention is directed to these, and other, important ends.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The starting perfluoroalkyl ether iodides can be made by the procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,481,028, herein incorporated by reference, in Example 8, which discloses the preparation of compounds of formula (LV) starting with perfluoroalkyl vinyl ethers. In the second reaction above, the perfluoalkyl ether iodide (LV) is reacted with an excess of ethylene at an elevated temperature and pressure. While the addition of ethylene can be carried out thermally, the use of a suitable catalyst is preferred. Preferably the catalyst is a peroxide catalyst such as benzoyl peroxide, isobutyryl peroxide, propionyl peroxide, or acetyl peroxide. More preferably the peroxide catalyst is benzoyl peroxide. The temperature of the reaction is not limited, but a temperature in the range of 110&#xb0; C. to 130&#xb0; C. is preferred. The reaction time may vary with the catalyst and reaction conditions, but we have found 24 hours (h) to be adequate. The product may be purified by any method that separates unreacted starting material from the final product, but distillation is preferred. Satisfactory yields up to 80% of theory have been obtained using about 2.7 mols of ethylene per mole of perfluoalkyl ether iodide, a temperature of 110&#xb0; C. and autogenous pressure, a reaction time of 24 h, and purifying the product by distillation.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The perfluoroalkyl ether ethylene iodides (LVI) can be treated with oleum and hydrolyzed to provide the corresponding alcohols (LVII) according to procedures disclosed in WO 95/11877. Alternatively, the perfluoroalkylether ethyl iodides can be treated with N-methyl formamide followed by ethyl alcohol/acid hydrolysis. The higher homologs (r=2, 3) of telomer ethylene iodides (LVI) are available with excess ethylene at high pressure.</p>

Organogelators and Nanoweb Composites
</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The compounds of various embodiments of the invention are useful as organogelators, i.e. compounds that can self-assemble into fiber-like morphologies. Upon cooling a hot, homogeneous solution of a thermoreversible gelator in a gelling solvent for example, the gelator molecules associate via intermolecular hydrogen bonds to form fibers, which are bundles of H-bonded gelator molecules. If these fibrous bundles grow to be sufficiently long, they become entangled with one another like covalently-linked polymer chains to gel their solvent medium. The solvent can be removed from the gel to leave behind a network of assembled gelator fibers, a &#x201c;nanoweb&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">An organogelator is defined herein to include a non-polymeric organic compound whose molecules can establish, between themselves, at least one physical interaction leading to a self-assembly of the molecules in a carrier fluid, with formation of a 3-D network, or a &#x201c;nanoweb gel&#x201d;, that is responsible for gelation of the carrier fluid. The nanoweb gel may result from the formation of a network of fibrous structures due to the stacking or aggregation of organogelator molecules. Depending on the nature of the organogelator, the fibrous structures have variable dimensions that may range up to one micron, or even several microns. These fibrous structures include fibers, strands and/or tapes.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The term &#x201c;gelling&#x201d; or &#x201c;gelation&#x201d; means a thickening of the medium that may result in a gelatinous consistency and even in a solid, rigid consistency that does not flow under its own weight. The ability to form this network of fibrous structures, and thus the gelation, depends on the nature (or chemical structure) of the organogelator, the nature of the substituents, the nature of the carrier fluid, and the particular temperature, pressure, concentration, pH, shear conditions and other parameters that may be used to induce gelation of the medium. The nanoweb gels can be reversible. For instance, gels formed in a cooling cycle may be dissipated in a heating cycle. This cycle of gel formation can be repeated a number of times since the gel is formed by physical, non-covalent interactions between gelator molecules, such as hydrogen bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A composition of one embodiment of the invention can be made using a nanoweb gel that comprises a nanoweb phase and a fluid phase, which, upon removal of the fluid, forms a porous interpenetrating nanoweb. The applicants have found that this capability is strongly dependent upon the particular structural characteristics of the organogelator and particular processing parameters including the nature of the solvent, temperature, gelator concentration, method of solvent removal, and the nature of the porous support.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The physical interactions of the organogelators are diverse and may include interactions chosen from hydrogen-bonding interactions, &#x3c0;-interactions between unsaturated rings, dipolar and van der Waals interactions, and coordination bonding with organometallic derivatives. In general, the non-covalent forces are weak compared to covalent bonds, which makes them reversible, and it requires that several of them be combined to form a strong association. For example, as discussed in Goshe, et al. (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA (2002) 99, 4823), the energy of a covalent C&#x2014;C bond is 350 kJ/mol, while the energy of a hydrogen bond ranges from 4 to 120 kJ/mol, and that of a &#x3c0;-stack from 4 to 20 kJ/mol. The establishment of these interactions may often be promoted by the architecture of the molecule, such as by one or more heteroatom-hydrogen bonds, aromatic rings, unsaturation, bidentate metal coordination sites, and favorable packing geometries. In general, each molecule of an organogelator can establish several types of physical interaction with a neighboring molecule. Thus, in one embodiment, the organogelator preferably comprises at least one conjugated group capable of establishing at least two hydrogen bonds; at least one group having at least two aromatic rings in conjugation; at least one group having 14-atom aromatic system; or at least one group capable of bidentate coordination with a metal ion.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Solvents and specific conditions for forming gels of many organogelators are available in the patent and scientific literature. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that some gelators may require some preliminary gelling experimentation. For such cases, a methodology has been developed for matching a solvent system with specific gelators to allow efficient gel formation. In general, if the gelator is too soluble, it will dissolve without forming a gel even at high concentrations. If the gelator is not soluble enough, it may or may not dissolve at high temperature, but precipitate again as the temperature is lowered. Ideally, the organogelator should dissolve in a solvent at some temperature and assemble into a network upon cooling. Preferably the gelators have a solubility in a solvent system of about 0.1 to 5 wt % at a temperature/pressure above the gel point. Changing the temperature and/or pressure, adjusting the solvent composition, adjusting the pH, altering the shear-state of thixotropic systems, or a combination of parameters can be used to induce gelling.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">For example, a screening protocol for evaluating thermo-reversible gels allows evaluation of a specific gelator with different solvents in parallel using a reactor block. In a typical set-up, 2 wt % slurries of the organogelator in solvents of varying polarities can be prepared, for example a series may include: water, n-butanol, ethanol, chloroform, toluene, and cyclohexane. The vials are then placed in a reactor block for 1 h while stirring at a temperature close to the boiling point of the solvent to induce dissolution. In the case of some gelators, for instance, urea-based gelators, additives such as lithium salts, for instance lithium nitrate, can be added in small amounts (0.1 to about 10 wt %, based on the amount of organogelator) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,420,466, hereby incorporated by reference. Upon cooling, gelation may occur and is evident by formation of a translucent to opaque appearance without the formation of solid crystals, and/or a significant increase in viscosity. If gelation does not occur, one can screen different solvents or solvent mixtures as well as different additives and additive levels. If a gelator sample is soluble in a given solvent, but organogelation does not occur, then one can either raise the gelator concentration to, for instance, 3 or 5 wt % and repeat the heating cycle, or one can lower the solubility of the compound by using a solvent mixture of lower polarity.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Preferred solvents for H-bonded organogelators are those having H-bonding capability that allows disruption of intermolecular H-bonding between solute molecules. Water, ammonia, alcohols, sulfoxides, esters, ethers, amines, amides, and lactams are useful. H-bonded organogelators often exhibit very high solubility in the lower alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. Whereas H-bonded organogelators often exhibit lesser solubility in the higher aliphatic and cyclic alcohols including propanol, butanol, hexanol, cyclohexanol and isomers thereof, making them more desirable for use as gelating solvents. Specific solvents that are especially useful in forming gelling mixtures include: water, the lower aliphatic and cyclic alcohols such as ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butanol, hexanol, cyclohexanol, cylopentanol, and octanol; aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, octane, toluene, xylenes, and mesitylene; amides and lactams such as N-methylpyrrolidone, pyrrolidone, caprolactam, N-methyl caprolactam, dimethyl formamide, and dimethyl acetamide; ethers such as dibutyl ether, dipropyl ether, methyl butyl ether; ether alcohols such as 2-methoxyethanol, 2-butoxyethanol, and others in the class of ethers known as CELLUSOLVES&#xae;; esters such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and the like; aliphatic and aromatic halocarbons such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and dichlorobenzene. Butanol, and especially n-butanol, is a preferred solvent for use in the process of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The gelling mixture, as applied to a solid or porous support, can be in the form of: a homogeneous isotropic solution; a gel that can be shear-thinned (thixotropic) to form a fluidized gel; or a gel in the form of a film, sheet or powder that can be melted to form a fluidized gel. Formulation of a suitable gelling mixture to depends upon the methods anticipated for applying the gelling mixture and gelling the impregnated or coated support. For instance, in a preferred embodiment the gelling mixture is a gel that can be shear-thinned prior to, or during, application to form a fluidized gel. The fluidized gel can then penetrate a porous support to provide an impregnated support.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In another preferred embodiment the gelling mixture is a homogeneous isotropic solution that, if so desired, is heated above ambient conditions. After applying the solution to provide a coated or impregnated support, the treated support can be cooled to induce gelation. Suitable gelling mixtures preferably comprise 0.01 to 20 wt % of one or more organogelators, and preferably, 0.5 to 5 wt %, with the remainder being solvent and other processing aids, for instance lithium salts.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Applying the gelling mixture to a solid or porous support can be done by a variety of methods including one or more of the steps of: spraying, coating, blading, casting laminating, rolling, printing, dipping, and immersing; and allowing gravity, diffusion, and/or flow through of the gelling mixture into the porous support, and, optionally, applying pressure, heat or vacuum. Spraying, coating, blading, casting and immersing are preferred methods for applying thixotropic gels and spraying and blading are most preferred. Laminating and heating is a preferred method for applying solid gels in the form of films. Spraying, coating, blading, casting, printing and immersing or dipping are preferred methods for applying homogeneous isotropic solutions. In some instances, it is advantageous to remove excess gelling mixture from the surface of a porous support, such as by scraping or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Gelling the treated support can be accomplished by a variety of methods depending upon the nature of the gelling mixture. In one preferred embodiment, wherein the gelling mixture is a thermo-reversible gel, the gelling step comprises cooling of a homogeneous solution of the gelling mixture in the impregnated support. The gelling mixture can be pre-heated to provide a homogeneous solution or can be cooled from ambient temperature, if so desired. Another preferred embodiment, wherein the gelling mixture is a gel applied with shearing, the gelling step can comprise abating the shearing in the impregnated support. This can be accomplished by allowing the impregnated support to sit for a period of time in the absence of shear. In another embodiment, wherein the gelling mixture is sensitive to pH, the impregnated support can be subjected to a change in pH. In other embodiments the solvent can be modified by addition of a non-solvent in a solvent exchange or partially removed to provide a gel.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Drying the gel, dr removing the solvent from the gel, will leave behind a porous nanoweb on and/or within a solid or porous support. Drying can be achieved through a variety of routes including freeze drying, ambient drying, oven, radiant and microwave heating, vacuum drying (with or without heat), or critical point drying (CPD). Alternatively the solvent can be exchanged with another fluid, in a fluid-fluid extraction process or a supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), which then can be removed from the gel via one of the aforementioned drying techniques, if so desired.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The drying method can have a profound effect on the resultant nanoweb structure as the various drying methods occur over different time scales, place different stresses on the nanoweb structure, and involve the crossing of different phase boundaries.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In vacuum drying, the driving force for solvent removal from the impregnated material is increased such that the solvent can be removed more readily, and thus without disruption of the assembled nanoweb. Heat can be used in combination with vacuum if it does not disrupt the gelled assembly. Ambient drying is performed at atmospheric pressure and optionally with heat. In freeze drying, the coated or impregnated material is rapidly frozen (on a time scale that does not allow for rearrangement of the gel structure) and solvent is subsequently sublimed away to provide the nanoweb material.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The porous nanoweb coatings can be characterized by a quantitative estimation of the surface tension relative to that of the support. Surface tension is typically characterized by measuring the contact angle of a water droplet or other liquid substance, contacting the surface in the advancing and receding dynamic modes. Contact angles can also be measured in a static mode. This is a well known method for determining surface properties and is discussed in detail in Physical Chemistry of Surfaces, 4th Ed., Arthur W. Adamson, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, 1982, pp. 338-361. The water contact angle is a quantitative measurement of the hydrophobicity of a surface. The higher the hydrophobicity, the higher will be the contact angle of the water droplet. Surfaces exhibiting water droplet advancing contact angles of greater than 150&#xb0; are considered super-hydrophobic. The details of contact angle measurements are discussed in the examples. Preferred nanoweb coatings of the invention are characterized by water droplet advancing contact angle of greater than 130&#xb0;. Other preferred coatings of the invention are characterized by a static hexadecane droplet contact angle of about 70&#xb0; or greater, indicating oleophobicity.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The composite materials of various embodiments of the invention can be used as gas-solid filter. The gas can be air, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, a noble gas, or any other process gas used in industrial or commercial processes. Air filters are preferred applications of the composite materials. Filters can be in the form of nonwoven pleated or unpleated cartridge filters, glass or other ceramic microfiber filters.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Since the individual organogelator molecules making up the nanoweb are not covalently bonded to one another, there are conditions in which the porous nanoweb can be easily dissolved and removed from the porous support. In applications wherein trapped material is of significant interest, for instance, biological material, radioactive material, etc., the solubility of the nanoweb is a particular advantage, as it can allow release and recovery of the trapped material. Such flexibility can be useful in recycling and recovery of composite materials as well.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The composite materials of various embodiments may also find use in barrier fabric applications, such as for protective clothing or construction wrap, in which good barrier against liquid penetration is provided while maintaining good air and moisture vapor permeability.</p>

<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Contact angle (CA) measurements to determine the contact angle of both water and hexadecane on a surface were performed using a goniometer. Ram&#xe9;-Hart Standard Automated Goniometer Model 200 employing DROPimage standard software and equipped with an automated dispensing system with 250 &#x3bc;l syringe was used, having an illuminated specimen stage assembly. The goniometer camera was connected through an interface to a computer and this allowed the droplet to be visualized on a computer screen. The horizontal axis line and the cross line could both be independently adjusted on the computer screen using the software.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Prior to contact angle measurement, the sample was placed on the sample stage and the vertical vernier adjusted to align the horizontal line (axis) of the eye piece coincident to the horizontal plane of the sample, and the horizontal position of the stage relative to the eye piece positioned so as to view one side of the test fluid droplet interface region at the sample interface.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">To determine the contact angle of the test fluid on the sample, approximately one drop of test fluid was dispensed onto the sample using a 30 &#x3bc;L pipette tip and an automated dispensing system to displace a calibrated amount of the test fluid. For water measurements deionized water was employed, and for oil measurements, hexadecane was suitably employed. Horizontal and cross lines were adjusted via the software in case of the Model 200 after leveling the sample via stage adjustment, and the computer calculated the contact angle based upon modeling the drop appearance. The initial contact angle is that angle determined immediately after dispensing the test fluid to the sample surface. Initial contact angles above 30 degrees are indicators of effective water and oil repellency. Contact angle can be measured after the droplet has been added to a surface (advancing contact angle, abbreviated &#x201c;Adv CA&#x201d;) or after the droplet has been partially withdrawn from a surface (receding contact</p>

<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Non woven fabrics or filter paper samples (about 3.0-3.5 cm squared) were immersed in a suspension of a gelator in organic solvent kept in closed reaction flask equipped with a stir bar and temperature controller. The mixtures were heated 5&#xb0; C. below the boiling point of the solvent for 1-2 hours until clear solutions formed. The flasks were then either rapidly cooled to RT by removing the oil bath or slowly cooled to RT by switching off the heat. Gel formation was usually observed in 2-6 h time and the gels were allowed to age for additional 6 h. The gelator impregnated samples removed and dried in a vacuum oven at RT or with critical point drying using carbon dioxide. The dried samples were weighed and used for contact angle measurements.</p>

The clear solution formed was either rapidly cooled to RT by removing the oil bath or slowly cooled by switching off the heat. Gel formation was usually observed in 2-6 h time and was allowed to age for additional 6 h. The aged gel was spread across a clean substrate using a flat spatula and immediately dried under vacuum at RT. The dried samples were weighed and used for contact angle measurements.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention pertains to musical instruments with removable mouthpiece assemblies, and more particularly to a novel assembly wherein the ligature has several positions spaced along a longitudinal axis of a mouthpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">B. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Woodwind instruments are instruments consisting of a tubular body used to define a column of air. As is well known in the art, sound waves are produced within the column of air and the musical characteristics of the sounds, including pitch, volume and other characteristics are modulated by changing the acoustic characteristics of the column. More specifically, a mouthpiece is attached by a friction fit to an end of the tubular body. The mouthpiece has a cavity in communication with the interior of the tubular body. A reed covers the cavity and is arranged so that when a musician blows through the mouthpiece, the reed oscillates and produces vibrations which are then propagated through the cavity in the mouthpiece to the tubular body. The reed is secured to the mouthpiece by an adjustable metal band known as the ligature.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The ligature normally extends circumferentially around the entire outer body of the mouthpiece. The ligature is provided with an integral tightening mechanism that is used to secure the reed to the mouthpiece. Because of the mechanical coupling between the ligature, the mouthpiece and the reed, the structure of the ligature plays a roll in the sound produced by the instruments, and various types of ligatures are available from different companies, each having its own sound characteristics. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show some known prior art mouthpieces and ligatures for saxophones.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A mouthpiece assembly includes a tubular mouthpiece a sidewall formed with a longitudinal portion and a ligature for securing a reed to the mouthpiece. The mouthpiece and the ligature are sized and shaped to define a plurality of discrete positions for the ligature. The ligature can secure the reed at each of its positions in a manner that allows the reed and the ligature to vibrate during play. In one embodiment, the mouthpiece has a longitudinal portion formed with spaced holes. The ligature includes a movable shaft that can be selectively inserted and retrieved from the holes to adjust the position of the ligature or remove it. Preferably, the holes are oversized so that the shaft fits loosely into the holes. The ligature has a threaded transversal hole and the shaft is threaded and is positioned in the transversal hole so that it can be selectively advanced into, or retracted from the holes in the mouthpiece.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to provide a better understanding of the invention, some prior art ligatures are first discussed. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a typical mouthpiece <b>102</b> is shown with a reed <b>104</b>. The reed <b>104</b> is secured to the mouthpiece <b>102</b> with a ligature <b>112</b>. The ligature <b>112</b> has a round hole <b>113</b> at the top and is tightened with two screws <b>115</b>. The reed <b>104</b> is secured to the mouthpiece <b>102</b> by the ligature <b>112</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a different ligature <b>114</b>. While the ligature <b>112</b> is a closed ring or band, the ligature <b>114</b> extends only partially beneath the mouthpiece. There this ligature <b>114</b> is useable only with a mouthpiece <b>102</b>A that has two longitudinal grooves or ledges <b>116</b> (only the near groove being visible in the Figure). The ligature includes a body <b>114</b> with two legs <b>120</b> (one of these being shown in the Figure) seated in the respective groove <b>116</b>. The ligature <b>114</b> further includes a thumb screw <b>122</b> riding on, or biasing a rail <b>124</b>. When the thumb screw <b>122</b> is tightened, it bears against the rail <b>124</b> which in turn engages and secures a distal end of reed <b>104</b>. The ligature has some limited movement in the longitudinal direction along the mouthpiece <b>102</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is well known that the position of the ligature on the mouthpiece has an effect on the sound produced by the respective instrument and therefore, once a musician locates the ligature position on a particular instrument, he would like to be able to mount the ligature in exactly the same position. A problem with the prior art ligatures, such as the two shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, is that the ligature is maintained in place by an interference fit with the external surface of the mouthpiece, and once they are loosened, they can be freely shifted longitudinally along the mouthpiece to several non-discrete positions. As a result, once a ligature is removed, it is very hard for the musician to place a ligature exactly to an optimum or predetermined position. Moreover, because the ligatures are held by friction, during use, they do loosen up occasionally and move or shift longitudinally to new positions that are undesirable. These problems are resolved by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Also, in the attempt to hold the ligature in place previous art ligatures utilize large surface areas of tight contact with the mouthpiece body <b>102</b>. Not only does this only moderately work, but most importantly the vibrations of the reed/ligature combination are dampened by the mouthpiece body <b>102</b> creating a severely deadening affect on the resultant sound produced by the mouthpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>2</b>A, a ligature <b>100</b> constructed in accordance with this invention includes a saddle <b>101</b> terminating in two arms <b>108</b>, each arm having a transversal threaded hole <b>108</b>. The holes accept corresponding set screws <b>109</b>. A thumb screw <b>122</b> is rotatably mounted on the saddle <b>101</b> and can be used to selectively raise and lower a rail <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The ligature <b>100</b> is used to mount a reed <b>104</b> on a mouthpiece <b>102</b>B. Mouthpiece <b>102</b>B has two elongated sections <b>107</b> on its sides, each section <b>107</b> being formed with holes <b>110</b> spaced longitudinally. The holes are sized so that the screws <b>109</b> can loosely fit into holes <b>110</b>. Once positioned, the screws <b>109</b>, held securely in the ligature by threaded holes <b>108</b> in the ligature, hold the ligature securely in place along mouthpiece <b>102</b>B by immovably fitting in holes <b>110</b>. This allows the ligature to vibrate freely in relation to the mouthpiece, while still securely being held in place.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2A</figref>, the ligature <b>100</b> is used to secure the reed <b>104</b> to the mouthpiece <b>102</b>B. More particularly, when thumbscrew <b>122</b> is tightened, it clamps the reed <b>104</b> between rail <b>124</b> and the outer surface of the mouthpiece <b>102</b>B in the normal manner. Importantly, by screwing and unscrewing set screws <b>109</b> the ligature can be selectively attached and detached from the mouthpiece <b>102</b>B by engaging one of the pairs of holes <b>108</b> (one hole is engaged on each side of the mouthpiece <b>102</b>B). Therefore the ligature can be positioned at any one of several positions defined by the holes <b>110</b>. Moreover, once a musician determines which positions he likes, he can then leave the ligature and the reed set in the same position all the time guaranteeing his favorite position at each next use.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Most importantly because the set-screws <b>109</b> are loose inside the holes <b>108</b> only minimal contact, and NO frictional contact, is had with the mouthpiece body <b>102</b>B. This allows the reed <b>104</b> and ligature body <b>106</b> combination to vibrate independently from the mouthpiece body <b>102</b>B and a free, open, and resonant resultant sound to be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Of course other means can be used to engage the ligature to the mouthpiece. For example, the set screw can be replaced by a spring-loaded shaft that can be easily inserted into and withdrawn from holes <b>110</b>. Further, the set screws could be loose inside the ligature holes <b>108</b> and screw into threaded holes <b>110</b>. Numerous modifications can be made to the invention without departing from the scope defined in the appended claims.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a surface acoustic wave element and a surface acoustic wave device using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A surface acoustic wave device (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;SAW device&#x201d;) is widely used in applications for compact information equipments such as HDDs (Hard Disk Drives), mobile computers, or IC cards, or mobile communication equipments such as cellar telephones, automobile telephones, or paging systems.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic perspective view of an existing SAW device <b>1</b>, in which a piezoelectric element <b>4</b> is contained in a package.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An IDT (Inter Digital Transducer) composed of a pair of comb-like electrodes <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b </i>is formed around a center of the piezoelectric element <b>4</b>, and reflectors <b>6</b>, <b>6</b> are formed at opposite sides of the IDT <b>5</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The piezoelectric element <b>4</b> is bonded to an inner bottom of the package <b>2</b> using an adhesive <b>3</b> in a manner to bond a central area of the piezoelectric element <b>4</b> to the package <b>2</b> by the adhere in order to prevent the piezoelectric element <b>4</b> from swinging significantly enough to clash with the package <b>2</b> at the time of, for example, a drop of an electronic device such as a cellar phone or the like equipped with the SAW device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The piezoelectric element <b>4</b> has a pair of terminals <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> electrically connected to the comb-like electrodes <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, respectively, in which the terminals <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> are connected to electrodes at a side of the package <b>2</b> or to a semiconductor element <b>8</b> by wire bonding. Herein, the pair of terminals <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> are disposed on the adhesive <b>3</b>, i.e., at the central area of the piezoelectric element <b>4</b> since the adhere <b>3</b> is used as a receiver for weight which is applied at the time of the wire bonding to the terminals <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the SAW device <b>1</b> having the central area of the aforementioned piezoelectric element <b>4</b> bonded to the package <b>2</b>, however, there is a fear of a change in an oscillation property due to warpage in the area formed with the IDT <b>5</b>, which is resulted from contraction stress of the adhesive <b>3</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a SAW device <b>9</b> which has been contemplated to reduce influence on an oscillation property, which is given by the contraction stress of the adhesive <b>3</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other words, in the case where the SAW device <b>9</b> is contained in the electric device which is hardly moved, the piezoelectric element <b>4</b> is less likely to clash with the package <b>3</b>, so that peripheral area other than the area formed with the IDT <b>5</b> is to be bonded to the package <b>2</b> by the adhesive <b>3</b>. As described above, the terminals <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> are disposed at the same peripheral area where the adhesive <b>3</b> is disposed since the adhesive <b>3</b> is used as a receiver for a weight at the time of the wire bonding (see, e.g., JP-A-2002-26656).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">JA-A-2002-26656 is an example of related art.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In consideration of both cases where the SAW device is used in applications for mobile electronic devices such as a cellar telephone and used in applications for hardly mobile electronic devices, it is necessary to prepare two types of SAW devices <b>1</b>, <b>9</b> different in positions of the terminals <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>, resulting in relatively expensive design development costs as well as causing increase in a stock amount.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An advantage of the invention is to provide a surface acoustic wave element and surface acoustic wave device at a low price, having a good oscillation property, which can be used in applications for various electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a first aspect of the invention, a surface acoustic wave element includes a piezoelectric substrate, an IDT composed of a pair of first and second comb-like electrodes, formed around a center of the piezoelectric substrate, and formed on a surface of the surface acoustic wave element, and a pair of first and second terminals electrically connected to the IDT, formed at central and peripheral areas of the piezoelectric substrate, respectively, in which a package is bonded with an adhesive to a surface of the surface acoustic wave element, opposite to the surface formed with the IDT.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to this aspect of the invention, the pair of first and second terminals is formed at the central and peripheral areas of the piezoelectric substrate respectively. Therefore, in the case of using this surface acoustic wave element in applications for a mobile electric device, the central area is coated with the adhesive to reduce a swing of the element in association with moving while the pair of terminals formed at this central area is wire-boded. In the case of use in applications for a hardly mobile electric device, the peripheral area is coated with the adhesive to reduce an influence on an oscillation property in association with a contraction stress of the adhesive while the pair of terminals formed at the peripheral area is wire-bonded. Therefore, this one type of SAW element can deal with both the mobile and immobile electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thus, a surface acoustic wave element at a low price, having a good oscillation property can be provided, which can be used in applications for various electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the above-mentioned structure, it is preferable that the pair of terminals be disposed at one side of the piezoelectric substrate in a latitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this manner, since the pair of terminals is disposed at one side of the piezoelectric substrate in a latitudinal direction, in the case of the surface acoustic wave element connected to the semiconductor element through a bonding wire, the bonding wire can be shortened by disposing the aforementioned side where the pair of terminal is formed, at a side where the semiconductor element is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the above-mentioned structure, it is preferable that the pair of terminals be formed by extending conductive patterns electrically connected to the first and second comb-like electrodes, respectively, through the use of reflectors disposed at opposite sides of the IDT in a direction that electrode fingers of the comb-like electrodes are arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this manner, the pair of terminals is formed by extending the conductive patterns electrically connected to the first and second comb-like electrodes, respectively, through the use of the reflectors disposed at the opposite sides of the IDT in a direction that electrode fingers of the comb-like electrodes are arranged. Therefore, a good oscillation property can be resulted from elimination of a necessity for extending the conductive pattern at the area where the reflectors are disposed, i.e., in a direction that the electrode fingers of the comb-like electrode, i.e., a direction of propagation of the surface acoustic wave, which is likely to have an influence on an oscillation property.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the above-mentioned structure, it is preferable that the first terminal be formed such that the first comb-like electrode of the pairs is extended to a region facing to a bus bar of the first comb-like electrode, and that the second terminal be formed such that the second comb-like electrode of the pair is extended to a region facing to a bus bar of the second comb-like electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this manner, the first terminal is formed such that the first comb-like electrode of the pairs is extended to a region facing to a bus bar of the first comb-like electrode, and the second terminal is formed such that the second comb-like electrode of the pair is extended to a region facing to a bus bar of the second comb-like electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to a second aspect of the invention, a surface acoustic wave device includes a surface acoustic wave element having a piezoelectric substrate, an IDT composed of a pair of comb-like electrodes, formed around a center of a surface of the piezoelectric substrate, and formed on a surface of the surface acoustic wave element, and a pair of first and second terminals electrically connected to the IDT, formed at central and peripheral areas of the piezoelectric substrate, respectively. The surface acoustic wave device also includes a package bonded and secured with an adhesive to a surface of the surface acoustic wave element, opposite to the surface formed with the IDT.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this structure, the pair of first and second terminals electrically connected to the IDT is formed at the central and peripheral areas of the piezoelectric substrate, respectively, so that one type of the surface acoustic wave element can deal with both mobile and non-mobile electronic devices in a manner similar to the first aspect of the invention, thereby resulting in reduction in development costs or in a stock amount.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Therefore, the surface acoustic wave device at a low price, having a good oscillation property can be provided, which be used in applications for various electronic devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show a surface acoustic wave device (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;SAW device&#x201d;) <b>10</b> according to an embodiment of the invention, in which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic plain view of the surface acoustic wave device and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a schematic cross section view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> along the line A-A. Meanwhile, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a view that is seen through a casing for convenience of understanding. Parallel oblique lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> do not express a cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In those FIGS., the SAW device <b>10</b> contains an electronic surface wave element (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;SAW element&#x201d;) <b>30</b> in a package <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the package <b>20</b> is wholly formed in a substantially rectangular shape by a sintering after lamination of first, second, and third substrates <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> as an insulating material, which are formed by shaping a ceramic green sheet of oxidized aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second and third substrates <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> each have predetermined via holes <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>a </i>inside such that an internal space S is formed in the case of lamination of the second and third substrates <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> onto the first substrate <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The internal space S is a space for containing the SAW element <b>30</b> therein, which is hermetically sealed by bonding a lid <b>24</b> to an end face at a side of an opening after mounting of the SAW element <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Used as the lid <b>24</b> in this embodiment is a conductor metal such as Fe&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Co alloy of metal system, and the lid <b>24</b> is bonded to the package <b>20</b> by a seal ring <b>26</b>. The lid <b>24</b> is electrically connected to a ground terminal, not shown, through a conductive part, not shown, inside the package <b>20</b>, thereby being connected to ground.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, the via hole <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the second substrate <b>22</b> is formed smaller than the via hole <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the third substrate <b>23</b> such that an upper surface of the second substrate <b>22</b> is partially exposed to the internal space S to form an upward tier section <b>22</b><i>b </i>in the case of lamination of the third substrate <b>23</b> onto the second substrate <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The upward tier section <b>22</b><i>b </i>exposed to the internal space S is disposed with electrode sections <b>28</b>, <b>28</b> which are formed by metallizing, for example, tungsten (W) as a base and by thereafter plating the metallized tungsten with nickel (Ni) and gold, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The electrode sections <b>28</b>, <b>28</b> are electrodes electrically connected to the SAW element <b>30</b> through a bonding wire such as a gold wire.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first substrate <b>21</b> is a substrate composing a bottom of the package <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and is bonded to the SAW element <b>30</b> by the adhesive <b>32</b>. In other words, an upper surface of the first substrate <b>21</b> of the package <b>20</b>, which is exposed to the internal space S, is coated with the nonconductive or conductive adhesive <b>32</b>, and the SAW element <b>30</b> is placed on the adhesive <b>32</b>, with the surface opposite to the surface formed with an IDT <b>40</b> to be described later contacting the adhesive <b>32</b>, and then the SAW element <b>30</b> is put in a heating furnace to heat and harden the adhesive <b>32</b>. In this manner, the SAW element <b>30</b> is bonded and secured to the package <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the adhesive <b>32</b> coats a central area M but may coat a peripheral area E as well. This point will be described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The SAW element <b>30</b> has the IDT (Inter Digital Transducer) <b>40</b> and reflectors <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> on a main surface of a piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With respect to the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b>, used as a piezoelectric material is, for example, a single-crystal substrate such as crystal or the like, or a multilayer substrate such as a substrate that a ZnO film formed on an Si substrate. In this embodiment, a crystal wafer cut in a rectangular shape is used as the piezoelectric material.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The IDT <b>40</b> is formed around a center of the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b> and is composed of a pair of comb-like electrodes <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>. The comb-like electrodes <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>each are disposed in a striped shape in a longitudinal direction of the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b> along bus bars <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b> formed in parallel with each other, such that a plurality of electrode fingers of the bomb-like electrodes <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>are disposed at predetermined intervals in a manner to thrust into each other in a staggered configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">This IDT <b>40</b> is formed on a surface of the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b> by a photolithography method after formation of conductive metal such as aluminum, titanium, or the like in a thin film form by means of, e.g., a vapor deposition or sputtering method.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, two reflectors <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> are formed at opposite sides of this IDT <b>40</b>, that is, both sides in a direction that the electrode fingers of the comb-like electrodes <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>are arranged, i.e., in a longitudinal direction of the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The reflectors <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> have a function of reflecting a surface acoustic wave propagated from the IDT <b>40</b> to seal energy of the surface acoustic wave inside, and a plurality of conductive sections <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> . . . parallel to the electrode fingers of the IDT <b>40</b> connect two parallel bus bars <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Meanwhile, in a manner similar to the IDT <b>40</b>, this reflector <b>50</b> is also formed from a conductive metal such as aluminum, titanium, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> with opposite polarities, which are electrically connected to the electrode sections <b>28</b>, <b>28</b> at a side of the package <b>20</b> through bonding wires such as a gold wire, is formed at a surface of the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b>. The pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> is electrically connected to the IDT <b>40</b> to allow input and output of signals therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, i.e., the first terminal <b>44</b> and the second terminal <b>46</b>, which are in pairs and electrically connected to the IDT <b>40</b>, are formed at the central area M and the peripheral area E of the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b>, respectively. Herein, the central area M is defined as an area disposed with the IDT <b>40</b> while the peripheral area E is defined as an area other than the area disposed with the IDT <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In other words, the first terminal <b>44</b> is such that a conductive pattern <b>49</b>, which is electrically connected to one of the comb-like electrodes <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>in pairs, i.e., the first comb-like electrode <b>40</b><i>b</i>, is extended to each of the central area M and the peripheral area E, in which a pad section <b>44</b><i>b </i>is formed at the central area M and a pad section <b>44</b><i>a </i>is formed at the peripheral section E. Furthermore, the second terminal <b>46</b> is such that a conductive pattern <b>48</b>, which is electrically connected the other comb-like electrode, i.e., the second comb-like electrode <b>40</b><i>a</i>, is extended to each of the central area M and the peripheral area E, in which a pad section <b>46</b><i>b </i>is formed at the central area M and a pad section <b>46</b><i>a </i>is formed at the peripheral section E.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the central area M, which is disposed with the pad section <b>44</b><i>b </i>of the first terminal <b>44</b> and the pad section <b>46</b><i>b </i>of the second terminal <b>46</b>, is coated with the adhesive <b>32</b>, and the wire bonding can be made to the pad sections <b>44</b><i>b</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>upon application of ultrasound with the adhesive <b>32</b> as a receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the SAW element <b>30</b>, even where the peripheral area E is coated with the adhesive <b>32</b>, since the pad section <b>44</b><i>a </i>of the first terminal <b>44</b> and the pad section <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the second terminal <b>46</b> are disposed at the peripheral section E, the wire bonding can be made to the pad sections <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Furthermore, the pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> is disposed at one side of the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b> in a latitudinal direction. In other words, in this embodiment, the second terminal <b>46</b> is formed by extending the conductive patterns <b>48</b>, <b>48</b> connected to the second comb-like electrode <b>40</b><i>a </i>of the pair, to a periphery of one side disposed with the first comb-like electrode <b>40</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, the electrode sections <b>28</b>, <b>28</b> at a side of the package <b>20</b>, which are electrically connected to the SAW element <b>30</b>, are not disposed at opposite sides of the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b> in a latitudinal direction but gathered at one side where the pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are formed, thereby being able to aim downsizing of a package.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the case where the pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, which are electrically connected to the comb-like electrodes <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>each located at opposite sides of the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b> in a latitudinal direction are gathered at one side, the extended pattern is more likely to have an influence on an oscillation property since the conductive pattern <b>48</b> to be extended to one side undesirably passes in a direction that the electrode fingers of the comb-like electrodes <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>are arranged, i.e., in the longitudinal direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Therefore, in this embodiment, the pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are formed by extending the conductive patterns <b>48</b>, <b>49</b>, which are electrically connected to the comb-like electrodes <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, through the use of the reflectors <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> disposed adjacently to opposites sides of the IDT <b>40</b>, i.e., opposite sides of the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b> in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In other words, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second terminal <b>46</b> is formed by extending the conductive patterns <b>48</b>, <b>48</b> connected to the second comb-like electrode <b>40</b><i>a </i>of the pairs, through the reflectors <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> at opposite sides of the IDT <b>40</b>, respectively, in a manner to locate adjacently to the opposite sides of the first terminal <b>44</b>, i.e., the terminals <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>. To be more precise, the second terminals <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>are made adjacent to the opposite sides of the first terminal <b>44</b> through the reflectors <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>, respectively, by connecting the bus bar <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the comb-like electrode <b>40</b><i>a </i>through the conductive patterns <b>48</b>, <b>48</b> to the bus bars <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the reflectors <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> as an extension of the bus bar <b>42</b> through the conductive patterns <b>48</b>, <b>48</b>. Therefore, the conductive patterns <b>48</b>, <b>48</b>, which connect the comb-like electrode <b>40</b><i>a </i>to the second terminal <b>46</b>, do not pass in a direction that the electrode fingers of the comb-like electrodes <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>are arranged, resulting in a good oscillation property.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">An embodiment of the invention has a structure as described above, in which the first and second terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, which are in pairs and electrically connected to the IDT <b>40</b>, are formed at the central area M and the peripheral area E of the piezoelectric substrate <b>34</b>, respectively. Therefore, in the case of using this SAW device <b>10</b> in applications for a mobile electric device, the central area M is coated with the adhesive <b>32</b> to reduce a swing of the SAW element <b>30</b> in association with moving while the wire bonding can be made to the pair of terminals <b>44</b><i>b</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>formed at this central area M. In the case of use in applications for a hardly mobile electric device, the peripheral area E is coated with the adhesive <b>32</b> to reduce an influence in an oscillation property in association with a contraction stress of the adhesive <b>32</b> while the wire bonding can be made to the pair of terminals <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>a </i>formed at the peripheral area E. Therefore, this one type of SAW element <b>30</b> can deal with both the mobile and immobile electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Meanwhile, the SAW device <b>10</b> may be transformed to a SAW oscillator by equipping an interior of the package <b>20</b> with an oscillation circuit element such as a semiconductor element having a circuit structure for oscillating the SAW element <b>30</b> at least. In this case, the bonding wire for connecting the SAW element <b>30</b> to the oscillation circuit element can be shortened by disposing the side of the saw element <b>30</b> where the pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> is formed, at a side where the oscillation circuit element is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Furthermore, in an embodiment such that the pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> is disposed at only one side of the piezoelectric element <b>34</b> in a latitudinal direction in a manner similar to this embodiment, the pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are formed at one of two peripheral areas E, E that sandwich the central area M therebetween, for example, the pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are formed at the peripheral area E at the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in this embodiment, but may be formed at the peripheral area E at the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The SAW device <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is different from the SAW device <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> only in a width of the SAW element <b>30</b> and the electrode section <b>28</b> at a side of the package <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In other words, in the SAW device <b>12</b>, the pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are disposed at only one side of the piezoelectric substrate <b>33</b> in a latitudinal direction in a manner similar to the SAW device <b>10</b>, thereby narrowing a width W<b>1</b> in a latitudinal direction at a side of the second comb-like electrode <b>40</b><i>a </i>where neither the pair of terminals <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, the IDT <b>40</b>, nor the reflectors <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> are formed.</p>

In other words, out of three electrode sections, the center electrode section <b>28</b><i>b</i>, which is corresponding to the first terminal <b>44</b>, is formed at the upward tier section <b>22</b><i>b </i>adjacently to the first terminal <b>44</b> in a manner to correspond to a distance between the pad section <b>44</b><i>b </i>of the first terminal <b>44</b> located at the central area M and the pad section <b>44</b><i>a </i>located at the peripheral area E.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a structure of plasma display panels.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present application claims priority from Japanese Application No. 2005-208719 and No. 2004-269673, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A surface-discharge-type alternating-current plasma display panel (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;PDP&#x201d;) has two opposing glass substrates placed on either side of a discharge-gas-filled discharge space. One of the two glass substrates has row electrode pairs extending in the row direction and regularly arranged in the column direction. The other glass substrate has column electrodes extending in the column direction and regularly arranged in the row direction. Unit light emission areas (discharge cells) are formed in matrix form in positions corresponding to the intersections between the row electrode pairs and the column electrodes in the discharge space.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The PDP further has a dielectric layer provided for covering the row electrodes or the column electrodes. A magnesium oxide (MgO) film is formed on a portion of the dielectric layer facing each of the unit light emission areas. The MgO film has the function of protecting the dielectric layer and the function of emitting secondary electrons into the unit light emission area.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A conventional method suggested for forming the MgO film of the PDP uses a screen printing technique to apply a coating of a paste containing an MgO powder mixture onto the dielectric layer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such a conventional PDP is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Application No. 6-325696, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the conventional MgO film is formed by use of a screen printing technique to apply a coating of a paste mixed with a polycrystalline floccule type magnesium oxide obtained by heat-treating and purifying magnesium hydroxide. Therefore, this MgO film thus formed provides the discharge characteristics of the PDP merely to an extent equal to or slightly greater than that provided by a magnesium oxide film formed by the use of evaporation technique.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An urgent need arising from this is to form a protective film capable of yielding a greater improvement in the discharge characteristics of the PDP.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to solve the problem associated with conventional PDPs having a magnesium oxide film formed as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To attain this object, the present invention provides a plasma display panel having a pair of substrates placed opposite each other on either side of a discharge space, discharge electrodes formed on one of the opposing substrates, and a dielectric layer covering the discharge electrodes, unit light emission areas being formed in the discharge space. The plasma display panel is characterized by crystalline magnesium oxide layers which includes magnesium oxide crystals causing a cathode-luminescence emission having a peak within a wavelength range of 200 nm to 300 nm upon excitation by an electron beam and which are each provided on a portion of the substrate having the discharge electrodes formed thereon and facing the discharge space.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As an exemplary embodiment of the best mode for carrying out the present invention, a PDP has a front glass substrate and a back glass substrate between which are provided row electrode pairs extending in a row direction and column electrodes extending in a column direction to form discharge cells in the discharge space in positions corresponding to intersections with the row electrode pairs. The PDP further has crystalline magnesium oxide layers provided on portions of a dielectric layer which covers either the row electrode pairs or the column electrodes, each portion facing a discharge cell and including an area facing at least either the row electrode or the column electrode. The crystalline magnesium oxide layers include magnesium oxide crystals causing a cathode-luminescence emission having a peak within a wavelength range of 200 nm to 300 nm upon excitation by an electron beam.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Each of he crystalline magnesium oxide layers including magnesium oxide crystals causing a cathode-luminescence emission having a peak within a wavelength range of 200 nm to 300 nm upon excitation by an electron beam is formed on at least a part, that is, that facing either the row electrode or the column electrode, within the portion of the dielectric layer facing the discharge cell. Because of this, the discharge characteristics of the PDP such as those relating to the discharge delay are improved. Thus, the PDP in the exemplary embodiment is capable of having satisfactory discharge characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, the formation of each of the crystalline magnesium oxide layers in a selected area including an area facing the row electrode or the column electrode makes it possible to greatly enhance the effect of shortening the discharge-delay time and to minimize the light-transmission reduction caused by the formation of the crystalline magnesium oxide layers.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the PDP, the crystalline magnesium oxide layers can be provided by being partially laminated on the thin film magnesium-oxide layer covering the dielectric layer, or alternatively they may be formed directly on required portions of the dielectric layer without a thin film magnesium-oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">If the crystalline magnesium oxide layers are formed directly on the portions of the dielectric layer, the crystalline magnesium oxide layers limit the discharge area to enable the initiation of a discharge only in the region of a high electric field strength, thereby making it possible to provide a high luminous efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">These and other objects and features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The crystalline MgO layer <b>5</b> of the PDP is formed by use of the following materials and method.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">MgO crystals, used as materials for forming the crystalline MgO layer <b>5</b> and causing CL emission having a peak within a wavelength range of 200 nm to 300 nm (particularly, of 230 nm to 250 nm, around 235 nm) by being excited by an electron beam, include crystals such as a single crystal of magnesium which is obtained, for example, by performing vapor-phase oxidization on magnesium steam generated by heating magnesium (this single crystal of magnesium is hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;vapor-phase MgO single crystal&#x201d;) As the vapor-phase MgO single crystals are included an MgO single crystal having a cubic single crystal structure as illustrated in the SEM photograph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and an MgO single crystal having a structure of cubic crystals fitted to each other (i.e. a cubic polycrystal structure) as illustrated in the SEM photograph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The vapor-phase MgO single crystal contributes to an improvement of the discharge characteristics such as a reduction in discharge delay as described later.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As compared with that obtained by other methods, the vapor-phase magnesium oxide single crystal has the features of being of a high purity, taking a microscopic particle form, causing less particle agglomeration, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The vapor-phase MgO single crystal used in the first embodiment has an average particle diameter of 500 or more angstroms (preferably, 2000 or more angstroms) based on a measurement using the BET method.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Note that the preparation of the vapor-phase MgO single crystal is described in &#x201c;Preparation of magnesia powder using a vapor phase method and its properties&#x201d; (&#x201c;Zairyou (Materials)&#x201d; vol. 36, no. 410, pp. 1157-1161, the November 1987 issue), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The crystalline MgO layer <b>5</b> is formed, for example, by the affixation of the vapor-phase MgO single crystal by use of a spraying technique, electrostatic coating technique or the like as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the above-mentioned PDP, a reset discharge, an address discharge and a sustaining discharge for generating an image are produced in the discharge cell C.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The reset discharge initiated prior to the initiation of the address discharge triggers the radiation of vacuum ultraviolet light from the xenon included in the discharge gas. The vacuum ultraviolet light triggers the emission of secondary electrons (priming particles) from the crystalline MgO layer <b>5</b> formed so as to face the discharge cell C, resulting in a reduction in the breakdown voltage at the time of the subsequent address discharge and in turn a speeding up of the address discharge process.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Because the crystalline MgO layer <b>5</b> is formed, for example, of the vapor-phase MgO single crystal, in the PDP the application of electron beam initiated by the discharge excites a CL emission having a peak within a wavelength range of 200 nm to 300 nm (particularly, of 230 nm to 250 nm, around 235 nm), in addition to a CL emission having a peak within a wavelength range of 300 nm to 400 nm, from the large-particle-diameter vapor-phase MgO single crystal included in the crystalline MgO layer <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a CL emission with peak wavelengths around 235 nm is not excited from a MgO layer formed typically by use of vapor deposition (the thin film MgO layer <b>4</b> in the first embodiment), but only a CL emission having a peak wavelengths from 300 nm to 400 nm is excited.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the greater the particle diameter of the vapor-phase MgO single crystal, the stronger the peak intensity of the CL emission having a peak within the wavelength range from 200 nm to 300 nm (particularly, of 230 nm to 250 nm, around 235 nm).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is conjectured that the presence of the CL emission having the peak wavelength from 200 nm to 300 nm will bring about a further improvement of the discharge characteristics (a reduction in discharge delay, an increase in the probability of a discharge).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">More specifically, the conjectured reason that the crystalline MgO layer <b>5</b> causes the improvement of the discharge characteristics is because the vapor-phase MgO single crystal causing the CL emission having a peak within the wavelength range from 200 nm to 300 nm (particularly, of 230 nm to 250 nm, around 235 nm) has an energy level corresponding to the peak wavelength, so that the energy level enables the trapping of electrons for long time (some msec. or more), and the trapped electrons are extracted by an electric field so as to serve as the primary electrons required for starting a discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Also, because of the correlationship between the intensity of the CL emission and the particle size of the vapor-phase MgO single crystal, the stronger the intensity of the CL emission having a peak within the wavelength range from 200 nm to 300 nm (particularly, of 230 nm to 250 nm, around 235 nm), the greater the improvement of the discharge characteristics caused by the vapor-phase MgO single crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In other words, when a vapor-phase MgO single crystal to be deposited has a large particle size, an increase in the heating temperature for generating magnesium vapor is required. Because of this, the length of flame with which magnesium and oxygen react increases, and therefore the temperature difference between the flame and the surrounding ambience increases. Thus, it is conceivable that the larger the particle size of the vapor-phase MgO single crystal, the greater the number of energy levels occurring in correspondence with the peak wavelengths (e.g. around 235 nm, a range from 230 nm to 250 nm) of the CL emission as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In a further conjecture regarding the vapor-phase MgO single crystal of a cubic polycrystal structure, many plane defects occur, and the presence of energy levels arising from these plane defects contributes to an improvement in discharge probability.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It is seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> that the display delay in the PDP is shortened by the 235-nm CL emission excited from the crystalline MgO layer <b>5</b>, and further as the intensity of the 235-nm CL emission increases, the discharge delay time is shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the comparison of the discharge delay characteristics between the case of the PDP having the double-layer structure of the thin-film MgO layer <b>4</b> and the crystalline MgO layer <b>5</b> as described earlier (Graph a), and the case of a conventional PDP having only a MgO layer formed by vapor deposition (Graph b).</p>

<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The crystalline MgO layer of the PDP in the first embodiment is laminated on the thin-film MgO layer. In the PDP of the seventh embodiment, a crystalline MgO layer is formed alone on the dielectric layer covering the row electrode pairs.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The structure on the back glass substrate <b>6</b> is the same as that in the first embodiment. The discharge space S between the front and back glass substrates <b>1</b> and <b>6</b> is filled with a discharge gas including xenon.</p>

<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The materials and method for forming the crystalline Mgo layer <b>65</b> are the same as in the case of the crystalline MgO layer in the first embodiment. The vapor-phase MgO single crystals used for forming the crystalline MgO layer <b>65</b> have an average particle diameter of 500 or more angstroms, preferably in a range from 2000 to 4000 angstroms, based on a measurement using the BET method. The crystalline MgO layer <b>65</b> can be formed by any method using various techniques such as a spraying technique, electrostatic coating technique, screen-printing technique, offset printing technique, dispenser technique, inkjet technique, roll-coating technique or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The PDP produces a reset discharge, address discharge and sustaining discharge in the discharge cells C in order to generate images. The reset discharge initiated prior to the initiation of the address discharge triggers the radiation of vacuum ultraviolet light from the xenon included in the discharge gas. The vacuum ultraviolet light triggers the emission of secondary electrons (priming particles) from the crystalline MgO layer <b>65</b> formed so as to face the discharge cell C, resulting in a reduction in the breakdown voltage at the time of the subsequent address discharge and in turn a speeding up of the address discharge process.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Because the crystalline MgO layer <b>65</b> is formed, for example, of the vapor-phase MgO single crystal, the application of electron beam resulting from the discharge excites a CL emission having a peak within a wavelength range of 200 nm to 300 nm (particularly, of 230 nm to 250 nm, around 235 nm), in addition to a CL emission having a peak within a wavelength range of 300 nm to 400 nm, from the large-particle-diameter vapor-phase MgO single crystal included in the crystalline MgO layer <b>65</b>. The presence of the CL emission having a peak wavelength from 200 nm to 300 nm can bring about a further improvement of the discharge characteristics of the PDP (a reduction in discharge delay, an increase in the probability of a discharge).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a graph showing the discharge delay characteristics of the PDP having the crystalline MgO layer <b>65</b> including the vapor-phase MgO single crystals. It is seen from this graph that the discharge delay characteristics are significantly improved as compared with a conventional PDP having a thin-film MgO layer formed by vapor deposition, as in the case of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The PDP of the first embodiment may possibly reduce in luminous efficiency because the formation of the thin-film MgO layer on the entire rear-facing face of the dielectric layer <b>3</b> may possibly lead to initiation of a useless discharge, for example, between the proximal ends (the parts connected to the bus electrodes Xb, Yb) of the transparent electrodes Xa, Ya and the bus electrodes Xb, Yb in which the electric field strength is low. However, in the PDP in the seventh embodiment, each of the crystalline MgO layers <b>65</b> alone is formed in an quadrangular area corresponding to the approximately entire areas of the wide distal ends Xa<b>1</b> and Ya<b>1</b> bordering the discharge gap g between the transparent electrodes Xa and Ya and this discharge gap g between the transparent electrodes Xa and Ya. For this reason, the discharge area for causing a sustaining discharge between the transparent electrodes Xa and Ya is restricted, so that a discharge is initiated only between the leading ends of the transparent electrodes Xa, Ya in which the electric field strength is high. In consequence, the PDP in the seventh embodiment is capable of providing a high luminous efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Further, the crystalline MgO layer <b>65</b> is formed of MgO single crystals, thus making it possible to significantly increase the lifespan of the PDP.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">As described hitherto, the PDP of the present invention has the crystalline MgO layers <b>65</b> formed of the MgO crystals causing a CL emission having a peak within a wavelength range from 200 nm to 300 nm upon excitation by an electron beam and each formed on a quadrangular portion of the dielectric layer <b>3</b> facing the opposing portions of the transparent electrodes Xa and Ya and the discharge gap g between the transparent electrodes Xa and Ya. This design allows an improvement of the discharge characteristics such as those relating to the discharge delay.

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The PDP in each of the embodiments is described under the comprehensive idea that a PDP has a pair of substrates placed opposite each other on either side of a discharge space, discharge electrodes formed on one of the opposing substrates, and a dielectric layer covering the discharge electrodes, unit light emission areas being formed in the discharge space, and is provided with crystalline magnesium oxide layers which includes magnesium oxide crystals causing a cathode-luminescence emission having a peak within a wavelength range of 200 nm to 300 nm upon excitation by an electron beam and which are each provided on a portion of the substrate having the discharge electrodes formed thereon and facing the discharge space.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In the PDP based on the comprehensive idea, each of he crystalline magnesium oxide layers including magnesium oxide crystals causing a cathode-luminescence emission having a peak within a wavelength range of 200 nm to 300 nm upon excitation by an electron beam is formed on at least a part facing the discharge electrode within the portion of the dielectric layer facing the unit light emission area. Because of this, the discharge characteristics of the PDP such as those relating to the discharge delay are improved. Thus, the PDP in the exemplary embodiment is capable of having satisfactory discharge characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Further, the formation of each of the crystalline magnesium oxide layers in a selected area including an area facing the discharge electrode makes it possible to greatly enhance the effect of shortening the discharge-delay time and to minimize the light-transmission reduction caused by the formation of the crystalline magnesium oxide layers.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The terms and description used herein are set forth by way of illustration only and are not meant as limitations. Those skilled in the art will recognize that numerous variations are possible within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from German Patent Application No. DE 10 2005 044 629.9, which was filed on Sep. 19, 2005, and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention concerns the error handling in the drive of electric motors, and particularly a concept to put a motor into a target state in a controlled manner at the occurrence of an error.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In numerous industrial applications, actuating or drive processes are executed by regulated electric motors. The failure of such a motor or of its regulation, which entails the immediate standstill of the motor, is often not tolerable due to safety considerations. For example, the abrupt failure of a coolant pump may induce strong local heating of a device to be cooled, so that there is a fire hazard. Among other things, this hazard is increased by the fact that at an abrupt failure of the coolant pump there is no time available to take potential countermeasures, i.e. suspend machining in the case of heat-generating machining of a material piece.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Modern steering assistance means or power steerings in motor vehicles are based on torque assistance made available by a regulated electric motor. In the current EPS (electrical power steering) systems, the steering assistance is turned off suddenly (in the range of a few milliseconds) in the event of an error (e.g. the failure of a component). Such a sudden failure of the steering assistance is extraordinarily dangerous, because the driver is surprised and cannot adjust to the changed situation any more, whereby life-threatening driving situations may arise.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above-mentioned problems are usually countered by redundantly embodying the regulation or motor systems. In the case of maximum redundancy, every individual system member, i.e. the electric motor itself and the regulation, which may include several sensor or computing elements cross-linked with each other, has to be embodied twice. In a power steering, it is the aim to maintain the steering assistance active as long as possible and additionally compensate for the failure of one or more components.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Apart from the obvious disadvantage of an increase in costs and the overall weight caused by the system, an extremely relevant factor in the automobile industry, the system complexity, is significantly increased by the redundant design. The hand-over of a faulty system function from a main system to a redundantly available backup system is an extremely complex process, because this transition has to take place in the running system without compromising the stability and functioning of the system. In order to make this possible, it is often even necessary to integrate new, additional components or sensors into the system, so that the transition from the main to the backup system can be ensured by means of additional locked loops or hand-over algorithms.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one embodiment, a motor control apparatus for controlling a motor, may have: a sensor for outputting sensor data; a controller for determining a target state of the motor depending on the sensor data, and for generating a motor control signal for controlling the motor depending on a deviation of a current state of the motor from the target state, to approximate the current state of the motor to the target state; a monitor for outputting an error signal at an error of the sensor or the controller; and a safety controller for generating, at the occurrence of an error signal, an alternative motor control signal suited to put the motor into a rest state in a controlled manner.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another embodiment, a method of controlling a motor, may have the steps of: sensing sensor data; determining a target state of the motor depending on the sensor data; generating a motor control signal for controlling the motor depending on a deviation of the motor from the target state to approximate a current state of the motor to the target state; outputting an error signal at an error; and generating, at the occurrence of the error signal, an alternative motor control signal suited to put the motor into a rest state in a controlled manner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another embodiment, a computer program with a program code for performing, when the program is executed on a computer, a method of controlling a motor, may have the steps of: sensing sensor data; determining a target state of the motor depending on the sensor data; generating a motor control signal for controlling the motor depending on a deviation of the motor from the target state to approximate a current state of the motor to the target state; outputting an error signal at an error; and generating, at the occurrence of the error signal, an alternative motor control signal suited to put the motor into a rest state in a controlled manner.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention is based on the finding that a motor controlled by a control means by means of a motor control signal so that it reaches a target state, which is derived from sensor data sensed by a sensor, can be put into a rest state at the occurrence of an error in simple and efficient manner by means of a safety means generating an alternative motor control signal at the occurrence of the error.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">By using an alternative, simplified motor control signal in the case of an error to put the motor into a rest state, i.e. typically the standstill, in a controlled manner, it is made possible, in an inexpensive manner and substantially without increase in system complexity, to reach a defined rest state. Doing this, a simplified mode of operation of the motor may additionally be ensured for a short period of time. Dangerous immediate function failures may thus be prevented without having to implement expensive redundancy systems.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In summary, the underlying idea is, instead of redundantly embodying components, to consciously accept a failure and integrate a corresponding fall-back solution into the overall concept. For example, in a regulating system of a motor controller, the failure of a microcontroller may be accepted. The failure is detected, and the motor is switched off in a user-manageable manner by a targeted shutdown via a fixed logic, which may, for example, be hard-wired. Apart from the employment of a second microcontroller, here also the second microcontroller supply integrated in an interface package can also be omitted, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A substantial advantage of the concept may be that the system costs are reduced by saving the redundancy systems on the one hand, and that the space requirement of an implementation is reduced significantly on the other hand.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, the absolute predictability of the switch-off process in safety-relevant systems, such as power steering, is a huge advantage, because a switch-off behavior leading to a smallest-possible impairment of safety may thus be chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, an electric motor regulation is used for the control of a motor drive of an electronically or electrically assisted steering system, in which a failure of a sub-component may require controlled switch-off of the steering assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">By the controlled shut-down of the steering assistance, e.g. taking place in the range of 2-4 seconds, life-threatening driving situations can be prevented from arising. Here, in the regulation of the motor, a cost-intensive integration of a second microcontroller as well as the accompanying supply unit, and moreover also the redundant design of the sensors sensing the steering angle and/or the torque at the steering wheel, can be completely omitted. Here, in the event of an error, the current that is used for driving the motor and the current strength of which is a measure of an additionally generated torque, i.e. the steering assistance, is reduced to zero with a predetermined temporal behavior from the moment of occurrence of the error. The steering assistance is switched off completely within this period of time. Although the integration of an additional safety means in the form of a hard-wired logic may be required for the simple current regulation, a logic hard-wired in such a manner has so little complexity that the loss of complexity of the overall system due to the no longer required redundant design is predominant by far. Overall, a significant reduction in the complexity of the system and the associated costs results, without this having negative effects on the system safety.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For safe switch-off of the electric motor generating the steering assistance, only the relatively inaccurate knowledge of the current with which the electric motor was operated at the time of occurrence of the error may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment, Hall sensors measuring the rotor position of the motor as auxiliary sensors if the actual rotor sensor has failed, can therefore additionally be omitted if a voltage measurement of the motor phases is performed instead, so that the functional state of the motor can be deduced on the basis of the voltage conditions. According to the embodiments, the implementation of redundancies can thus be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another embodiment, an emergency operation function of the electric steering assistance is ensured with only little overhead by additionally connecting the safety means to a sensor determining the torque at the steering wheel and/or a steering wheel angle, so that even in a failure of a microcontroller controlling the steering assistance simple steering assistance, which is indeed no longer velocity-dependent but nevertheless reduces the forces at the steering wheel, can still be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In summary, the concept of a steering assistance thus is, instead of redundantly embodying components, to consciously accept a failure and integrate a corresponding fall-back solution into the overall concept. Cost-intensive backup solutions, such as microcontrollers (&#x3bc;C), voltage supplies, additional sensors or locked loops, and complex hand-over algorithms are thereby avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an motor control means <b>10</b> comprising a sensor <b>12</b>, a control means <b>14</b>, a monitoring means <b>16</b>, as well as a safety means <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sensor <b>12</b> senses sensor data indicating the target state of the motor. This may, for example, be a rotational speed or a torque. The sensor data are communicated from the sensor <b>12</b> to the control means <b>14</b> calculating a target state of the motor based on the sensor data and comparing the same with a momentary actual state of the motor. The control means <b>14</b> calculates a motor control signal suited to control the motor so that it reaches or maintains the target state, so that a possible deviation of the actual state from the target state is compensated for. The motor control signal is provided by the control means <b>14</b> at a control signal hand-over point <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The monitoring means communicating an error signal to the safety means <b>18</b> at the occurrence of an error for example of the sensor <b>12</b> or the control means <b>14</b> may be connected to the sensor <b>12</b> and the control means <b>14</b> for the purpose of monitoring the sensor <b>12</b> and the control means <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When communicating an error signal from the monitoring means <b>16</b> to the safety means <b>18</b>, the safety means generates an alternative motor control signal suited to put the state of the motor into a rest state in a controlled manner. For example, this can mean reducing the motor rotation speed from the momentary rotation speed to zero in a controlled manner or reducing a torque momentarily generated to zero. The alternative motor control signal is also made available by the safety means <b>18</b> at the control signal hand-over point <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">By the motor control means <b>10</b>, it thus becomes possible to put a motor into a desired rest state in a controlled manner at a failure or malfunction of the control means <b>14</b>, the sensor <b>12</b>, or another system component, wherein the functioning of the motor can be partially ensured further for a short period of time, i.e. the motor does not abruptly suspend the operation without warning.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Here, it has to be ensured that from the occurrence of the error signal the motor is only controlled by the alternative motor control signal. In the case of a complete failure of the control means <b>14</b>, simple superimposition of the motor control signal and the alternative motor control signal, as suggested in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is sufficient, because the control means <b>14</b> then can no longer output a motor control signal. If it is ensured that the control means <b>14</b> no longer outputs a signal at an error of the sensor <b>12</b>, simply superimposing the motor control signal and the alternative motor control signal is also sufficient for this scenario.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">If one cannot assume that the control means does not output a signal in the event of an error, in an embodiment it also can be ensured by further measures that a control signal is only formed by the alternative motor control signal. For example, the error signal may also be communicated to the control means <b>14</b> so that the same interrupts its output in the case of an error.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The manner of how it is ensured that the motor is controlled only by the alternative motor control signal from the occurrence of the error signal on is secondary for the idea of the invention. Hence, every suitable circuit or measure achieving this aim is suited.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the basis of the subsequent <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>, the functioning of the concept for motor control on the basis of the integration in an electric steering assistance system will be illustrated in the following, wherein at first a system corresponding to the prior art will be described on the basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> so as to make clear the idea and the resulting advantages for the application in electrically assisted steering systems.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of a system for electric steering force assistance, as it is common at the moment. The steering force assistance means comprises a control means <b>24</b> for generating a motor control signal for controlling a motor <b>26</b>, a torque sensor <b>28</b>, a control sensor <b>30</b> as well as a rotor sensor <b>32</b> for controlling the rotor position of the motor <b>26</b>, one or more Hall sensors <b>34</b> as a fall-back plane to the sensor <b>32</b>, as well as one or more current measurement sensors <b>36</b>. The control means <b>24</b> includes a microcontroller <b>38</b>, a microcontroller assistance means <b>40</b>, a redundant microcontroller assistance means <b>42</b>, auxiliary sensors <b>44</b>, a sensor signal rendition <b>46</b>, a monitoring means <b>48</b>, a CAN transceiver <b>50</b> for communication with the vehicle bus, an MOS driver <b>52</b> as well as a current control stage <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Here, the sensors and/or components not substantial for the understanding of the principle functioning of the steering assistance system are illustrated as functional blocks having no connection to other functional blocks. The functions taken over by these components are only hinted at briefly in the following. The microcontroller assistance means <b>40</b> makes available all resources prerequisite to the employment of the microcontroller <b>38</b>, such as various supply voltages. The redundant microcontroller assistance means <b>42</b> is equivalent to the microcontroller assistance means <b>40</b> and is provided so as to take over its functions in the event of an error of the microcontroller assistance means <b>40</b>. The auxiliary sensors <b>44</b> serve for the assistance of the functioning of the system, they may, for example, be temperature sensors diagnosing overheating of the circuit or the microcontroller <b>38</b>, in order to control fans preventing the overheating, for example. The auxiliary sensors <b>44</b> may, however, also be sensors necessary for switching over to a redundant system, such as current sensors and/or voltage sensors, which ensure, at the transition from the microcontroller assistance means <b>40</b> to the redundant microcontroller assistance means <b>42</b>, within a locked loop that a supply current which may be required for the operation of the arrangement remains constant. The sensor signal rendition <b>46</b> is responsible for rendering the original signal provided from sensors so that the physical measurement quantity that a certain sensor, such as the torque sensor <b>38</b>, is to determine is extracted from the sensor signal. The monitoring means monitors the error-free functioning of the components concerned in the control of the motor, particularly of the microcontroller <b>38</b>, the functioning of which may, for example, be controlled by common watchdog techniques. The CAN transceiver <b>50</b> serves to exchange information with other vehicle components via the vehicle-internal CAN bus system, in order to obtain the vehicle velocity or communicate the momentary steering angle to other components, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The sensor signal, on the basis of which it is substantially determined with which force or with which torque the motor <b>26</b> is to assist a steering process, is provided from the torque sensor <b>28</b>. To this end, the torque sensor <b>28</b> measures the torque exerted on a link between the steering wheel and the motor <b>26</b>, which is also a measure for the force with which a driver has to hold and/or move the steering wheel. It is the aim of the steering assistance to limit this force, i.e. to prevent a driver from having to actuate the steering wheel with more than a maximum force, which may additionally be velocity-dependent. On the basis of the torque measured by the torque sensor <b>28</b>, the desired torque assistance the motor <b>26</b> is to perform can be calculated. This calculation is performed by the microcontroller <b>38</b>, for which the same obtains the sensor signal of the torque sensor <b>28</b>. Moreover, in the shown case, which is based on redundant system design, there is a control sensor <b>30</b>, which may a torque sensor or a sensor measuring the steering angle, which is also connected to the microcontroller <b>38</b>, so that the same can access the data of the control sensor <b>30</b> at a failure of the torque sensor <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The steering assistance the motor <b>26</b> is to provide is introduced into the steering mechanism by generating a torque by the motor <b>26</b>. The motor <b>26</b> is a 3-phase driven motor, in which the torque generated by the motor <b>26</b> is proportional to the current strength flowing through the field coils. Here, the magnetic field within the motor <b>26</b> is made to follow a rotor rotation so that the same is perpendicular to the rotor windings at all times, so that a maximum, but current-strength-dependent torque can be generated. On the one hand, the position of the motor rotor with reference to the field coils is to be measured, which is ensured by the rotor sensor <b>32</b>, and, on the other hand, the motor current is determined with the aid of the sensor(s) <b>36</b>. The sensor data of the current sensor <b>36</b> and of the rotor sensor <b>32</b> are made available to the microcontroller <b>38</b>, so that it can ensure, in the form of a regulation, that the electrical field and the rotor coils are perpendicular to each other at all times.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The current measurement sensor <b>36</b> determining the current impressed on the motor <b>26</b> as a field coil current, based on the ohmic measurement principle, serves for further function control. For controlling the current strength and phase location of the three phase-shifted supply currents, the current measurement signal of the current measurement sensor <b>36</b> is also applied to the microcontroller <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The microcontroller <b>38</b> then may calculate a required phase shift or tracking of the phase of the coil current from the data of the rotor sensor <b>32</b>, the Hall sensor <b>34</b>, and the current sensor <b>36</b> on the one hand, a required current strength to achieve the desired torque assistance by the motor <b>26</b>, based on the torque measurement value of the torque sensor <b>28</b>, on the other hand. The required mean current strength can be generated by means of a pulse-width-modulated signal, i.e. with a signal of constant amplitude, which is quickly switched on or off in a temporally variable manner. The MOS driver <b>52</b> serves to generate the control current which may be required for the drive of the six power transistors located within the current control stage <b>54</b>, because it is too large to be able to be generated directly by a microcontroller output <b>38</b>. Hence, the microcontroller is connected to the current control stage <b>54</b> via the MOS driver <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Intercepting an error of the conventional steering assistance system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> thus is substantially based on a redundant design of the torque-giving sensor and the supply of the microcontroller <b>38</b>, so that at least at a failure of the torque sensor <b>28</b> or of the microcontroller assistance means <b>40</b> the normal functioning can be largely maintained. At a failure of the microcontroller <b>38</b>, however, the signal driving the motor <b>26</b> disappears abruptly, so that the steering assistance fails immediately without warning.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, it is to be pointed out that the seamless transition during the operation from a primary to a redundant system, particularly at the transition from the microcontroller assistance means <b>40</b> to the redundant microcontroller assistance means <b>42</b>, is an extremely critical process, for which additional complex regulations not illustrated here have to be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, an application of the motor control means to a steering assistance means, as it is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, will be explained in the following. The changes with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> substantially consist in adding or removing components, which is why those components already having been described on the basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> carry the same reference numerals as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and wherein repeated explanation of the functionality of these components is also omitted in the following figures.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> additionally comprises a safety means <b>60</b> within the control means <b>24</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, less redundancy of devices may be required (crossed-out blocks) when using a motor control means. In the case of an occurrence of an error detected by the monitoring means <b>48</b>, it is the task of the safety means <b>60</b> to apply a pulse-width-modulated signal to the MOS driver <b>52</b>, so that the current strength impressed on the motor <b>26</b> at the time of the occurrence of the error approaches zero with defined temporal behavior. To this end, the current flowing into the motor <b>26</b> has to be measured by the safety means <b>60</b>, to which end it is connected to both the current measurement sensor <b>36</b> and the Hall sensor <b>34</b>, the signal of which indicates the rotor position.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, if the monitoring means <b>48</b> generates an error signal, a pulse-width-modulated signal imparted on the motor <b>26</b> via the MOS driver <b>52</b> and the current control stage <b>54</b>, so that it continuously obtains less current, i.e. the servo-assistance of the steering force continuously becomes less, is generated by the safety means <b>60</b>. Thus, avoiding the sudden drop in steering assistance and the concomitant safety risks, wherein the failure of every sensor as well as of the microcontroller <b>38</b> itself can be made compensated for, has been successful in a hardware-saving and efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the above application, it is substantial that the motor <b>26</b> is controlled only by means of the pulse-width-modulated signal of the safety means <b>60</b> from the occurrence of the error signal on. This may, for example, be ensured by a switch in the MOS driver <b>52</b>, to which end the same also has to obtain the error signal. Alternatively, the output of the potentially still functional microcontroller <b>38</b> may also be switched off by means of the error signal, so that then an addition of the signals in the MOS driver <b>52</b> would be sufficient to assure the function. With reference to further alternatives to ensure that the motor <b>26</b> is only controlled by means of the pulse-width-modulated signal of the safety means <b>60</b> in the case of an error, reference is to be made here to the statements regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this method, the redundant design of the &#x3bc;C means <b>42</b> can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an embodiment in which the comparably complicated Hall sensor in the motor <b>26</b> can be omitted, because a phase voltmeter <b>62</b> is integrated into the system in addition to the current measurement sensor <b>36</b>, so that the current flowing into the motor <b>26</b> can be measured by the current measurement sensor <b>36</b>, wherein the phase voltages at the motor are sensed by the phase voltmeter <b>62</b>, so that the rotor position of the motor <b>26</b> can be deduced on the basis of the current-voltage behavior. The current and rotor position quantities to be treated in a controlled manner in the case of an error are detected by the safety means <b>60</b> by the fact that both the current measurement sensor <b>36</b> and the phase voltmeter <b>62</b> are connected to the safety means <b>60</b>. In the case of an error, the motor <b>26</b> is put into the rest state, as already described on the basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, wherein all error scenarios can also be intercepted here. In this example, the steering assistance following the steering angle of the driver is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an extension of the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in which the control means <b>60</b> is additionally supplied with a signal from the sensor <b>28</b>, which usually is a torque sensor, i.e. which describes the desired torque. In addition, this information is made available to the safety means <b>60</b>, which is why the safety means <b>60</b> is connected to the sensor <b>28</b>. In addition to simple switching-off or controlled shutdown of the steering assistance, in the configuration described, it is possible to provide, at the failure of the microcontroller <b>38</b> or the torque sensor <b>28</b>, a basic, non-regulated steering assistance by means of the safety means <b>60</b> on a short-time basis, wherein the regulation is replaced by a control by the safety means <b>60</b>. Moreover, during a switch-off process or an emergency operation, the steering position may be switched over by a sensor-free commutation (more inaccurate, but sufficient) on a short-time basis, instead of a redundant rotor sensor. The signals of the current measurement sensor <b>36</b> and the back-current sensor <b>62</b> can be used for this. In this example, the steering assistance can also follow the steering angle of the driver in the emergency operation.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a variation of the case already discussed on the basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, wherein the rotor position is measured by one or more Hall sensors in the motor <b>26</b> by a Hall sensor <b>34</b> in the case of an error, wherein the safety means is also connected to the sensor <b>28</b>, to obtain steering information during a switch-off process. In this case, the commutation is performed by the combination of the signals of the current measurement sensor <b>36</b> and of the Hall sensor <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the above-mentioned examples of a servo-assisted steering, the failure of a microcontroller is consciously accepted. The failure is detected and switched off by targeted shutdown via a hard-wired logic (the safety means <b>60</b>) in a user-manageable manner. Hence, apart from the employment of a second microcontroller, the second microcontroller supply integrated in the interface package can also be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Cost-intensive backup solutions, such as microcontrollers, voltage supplies, additional sensors or locked loops, and complex hand-over algorithms are avoided. The simplification of the overall system thus increases the chance of acceptance in the market and may favor the development of a new &#x201c;steer by wire&#x201d; market.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The system is exemplarily shown here on the basis of an EPS (electrical power steering) system, but may also be applied to other complex motor controls. This may, for example, be the regulated drive of a conveyor belt that would damage the conveyed goods at an abrupt stop. Moreover, e.g. pump and fan controls may be considered, in which there are numerous scenarios in which at least an emergency operation power for a few seconds still has to be ensured so as to prevent further damage.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The motor state to be achieved at a failure of part of the regulation system does not always have to be the standstill. In a regulated motor supposed to ensure constant conveyor belt velocity under variable loads, a constant current may, for example, be impressed on the motor by the safety means in the case of an error, in order to obtain an approximately constant rotation speed of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In a desired reduction of the current to zero, the reduction may have any temporal course, i.e. for example proceed in steps of discrete temporal length, or may have a temporally continuous course.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Although the exemplary case of application described on the basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> has been described on the basis of a special system for driving an electric motor for the steering assistance in vehicles, the concept may also be combined with any other electrically assisted steering. For example, the torque sensor does not have to be directly connected to the microcontroller, it being also possible to make torque information available via the vehicle bus, and thus via the CAN transceiver <b>50</b>. The regulation of the motor described on the basis of the figures may also be based on physical quantities other than those exemplarily named in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The error scenarios described on the basis of the figures are only to be understood as exemplary, because all error scenarios within the open-loop and closed-loop control circuit of the electric motor can be intercepted.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Depending on the conditions, the method of controlling a motor may be implemented in hardware or in software. The implementation may be on a digital storage medium, in particular a floppy disc or a CD with electronically readable control signals capable of interacting with a programmable computer system so that the method of controlling a motor is executed. In general, the invention thus also consists in a computer program product with a program code stored on a machine-readable carrier for performing the method, when the computer program product is executed on a computer. In other words, the invention may thus be realized as a computer program with a program code for performing the method, when the computer program is executed on a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">While this invention has been described in terms of several embodiments, there are alterations, permutations, and equivalents which fall within the scope of this invention. It should also be noted that there are many alternative ways of implementing the methods and compositions of the present invention. It is therefore intended that the following appended claims be interpreted as including all such alterations, permutations, and equivalents as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and their applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical MRI technique produces an image of a selected body part of an object under examination by manipulating the magnetic spins of hydrogen atoms or protons in body parts such as fat and water molecules and measuring the signals of the manipulated magnetic spins. The measured responses from the magnetic spins are processed to extract images. A MRI system may be designed to generate different magnetic fields for imaging, including a static magnetic field (B<sub>0</sub>) along a z-direction to polarize the magnetic spins, gradient fields along mutually orthogonal x, y, or z directions in a xyz coordinate system to spatially select a body part for imaging, and a radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field (B<sub>1</sub>) to manipulate the spins. MRI techniques may be used to capture the functional changes in body parts or tissues such as the brain perfusion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In MRI, various characteristic times are generally referred to as T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>*, TR, TI, and TE. T<sub>1 </sub>designates the spin-lattice relaxation time, T<sub>2 </sub>designates the spin-spin relaxation time, and T<sub>2</sub>* designates the relaxation time in the transverse plane (with contributions from spin-spin relation, as well as other factors causing de-phasing in the transverse plane). TR designates a repetition time, TI designates an inversion time, and TE designates the echo time.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This application describes, among others, MRI techniques and systems that use ultra-short echo times, including methods, computer programs, and apparatus as described in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, in one aspect, a method includes sending an excitation RF pulse and a slice selection gradient pulse to selectively excite a target, the slice selection gradient pulse in a first direction. The method further includes subsequently acquiring data from the target to produce a first set of data, reversing the slice selection gradient pulse from the first direction to a second, opposite direction to selectively excite the target, and acquiring data subsequent to the reversed slice selection gradient pulse to produce a second set of data. The excitation RF pulse and the slice selection gradient pulse may be shorter than a short T<sub>2 </sub>time in the target. The first and second sets of data may be added to construct radial imaging of a corresponding k-space without rephrasing of the slice selective excitation RF pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method may further include quickly reducing the slice selection gradient at an end of the excitation RF The method may further include reducing long T<sub>2 </sub>components to enhance an image of short T<sub>2 </sub>components. Acquiring the data may be initiated after the excitation RF pulse and the slice selection gradient are ramped down to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In general, in another aspect, a method may include generating an inversion pulse to substantially invert magnetic moments of a first component of a sample, the first component having a first T<sub>2</sub>, and wherein the sample further includes a second component having a second T<sub>2 </sub>less than the first T<sub>2</sub>. The method may further include, after an inversion time TI, generating an ultra-short TE pulse sequence to selectively excite magnetic moments in a first slice of the sample. The method may further include detecting a generated signal based on the selective excitation of the magnetic moments in the first slice of the sample, and wherein TI is selected to reduce a contribution to the generated signal from magnetic moments of the first component with respect to the second component.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, in another aspect, a method of magnetic resonance imaging, may include generating a fat suppression pulse to excite magnetic moments of a fat component of a sample, wherein the sample further includes a first component having a first T<sub>2 </sub>and a second component having a second T<b>2</b> less than the first T<sub>2</sub>. The method may further include generating a 90 degree pulse to rotate magnetic moments of a first component of the sample having a first T<b>2</b> 90 degrees. The method may further include generating a dephasing gradient pulse to de-phase magnetic moments of the first component of the sample. The method may further include generating an ultra-short TE pulse sequence to selectively excite magnetic moments included in the first slice of the sample, and detecting a generated signal based on the selective excitation of the magnetic moments in the first slice of the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In general, in another aspect, an apparatus for magnetic imaging may include a magnet to generate an RF field, the magnet configured to generate an RF field having a magnitude of 30 microTesla or greater. The apparatus may further include a magnet controller in communication with the magnet. The magnet controller configured to cause the magnet to generate an excitation RF pulse and a slice selection gradient pulse, the slice selection gradient pulse in a first direction, the slice selection gradient pulse having a gradient slew rate and a gradient strength; and subsequently reverse the slice selection gradient pulse from the first direction to a second, opposite direction.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Various conventional MRI systems and techniques may be inadequate to image certain components with short T<sub>2 </sub>times. Imaging short T<sub>2 </sub>components of tissues and other samples is desirable in various clinical diagnostic applications. The ability to image both shorter and longer T<sub>2 </sub>components may be beneficial as well.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Systems and techniques described herein may provide for performing magnetic resonance of samples having components with short T<sub>2</sub>'s. For example, exemplary MRI techniques for performing clinical ultra-short TE (UTE) pulse sequences in imaging tissues or tissue components with short T<sub>2</sub>'s are described. In some implementations, target tissues may be divided into tissues with a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>relaxation components and tissues with a minority of short T<sub>2</sub>'s. Systems and techniques provided herein may be used to increase contrast between short T<sub>2 </sub>and long T<sub>2 </sub>tissue components.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For traditional, relatively long T<sub>2 </sub>imaging, spin-echo techniques may be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows an example of a spin-echo process <b>100</b> that may be used to determine T<sub>2 </sub>of samples with relatively long T<sub>2</sub>'s. At <b>110</b>, the z-components of the magnetic moments of the sample nuclei are generally aligned with an external longitudinal (z-direction) magnetic field, B<sub>0</sub>. At <b>120</b>, a &#x3c0;/2 pulse is applied. That is, an RF pulse is applied for a time sufficient to rotate the magnetization of the spins into the transverse plane. Once rotated, the spins begin to de-phase. At <b>130</b>, a &#x3c0; pulse is applied. After the &#x3c0; pulse, the spins begin to re-phase. At <b>140</b>, the spins return to the initial phase state, and a measurement of the magnetization shows a peak. The peak occurs at a time referred to as the echo time, TE. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a signal that may be measured using a spin-echo technique. Both T<sub>2</sub>* and T<sub>2 </sub>may be determined using the envelopes of the detected signals. Note that many types and variations of pulse sequences may be used for MRI imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For some types of MRI studies, such as medical imaging, slice selective MRI may be used to selectively image slices of the tissue. One example of slice selective MRI is a gradient echo imaging method. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows an example of a process <b>150</b> that may be used to image slices using gradient echo imaging. At <b>152</b>, the sample to be imaged is placed in a magnetic field B<sub>0</sub>. At <b>154</b>, a constant z-gradient is applied during the RF pulse for a total time &#x3c4;<sub>rf</sub>. At <b>156</b>, the Z-gradient is reversed immediately following the pulse. At the end of the re-phase lobe of the slice select gradient, the transverse magnetization components in the slice are in phase. At <b>158</b>, after the slice select gradient is turned off, it is followed by a phase encoding gradient G<sub>y</sub>. At <b>160</b>, a gradient G<sub>x</sub>, is applied, with a negative dephasing lobe followed by a read (or re-phasing) lobe. At <b>162</b>, the signal is detected to determine properties of the particular selected slice. At <b>164</b>, the process is repeated, with the phase encoding gradient G<sub>y </sub>stepped through different values.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In order to image samples that include components with short T<sub>2</sub>'s, techniques referred to as ultra-short TE techniques (UTE) may be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows an example of a pulse sequence <b>200</b> for UTE imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A first, half RF pulse <b>205</b> is applied, followed by radial imaging of k-space from the center out. For the first acquisition, the z gradient G&#x2032;<sub>z </sub><b>210</b> is negative. The RF pulse is truncated and followed rapidly by the acquisition, during which G&#x2032;<sub>x </sub><b>215</b> and G&#x2032;<sub>y </sub><b>220</b> are applied to provide the radial gradient. A second, half RF pulse <b>225</b> is applied, with the z gradient G&#x2032;<sub>z </sub><b>230</b> positive. The RF pulse is again truncated, and the second acquisition is performed. During the second acquisition, G&#x2032;<sub>x </sub><b>215</b> and G&#x2032;<sub>y </sub><b>220</b> are again applied to provide the radial gradient. The two sets of data are added to give a single line of k-space, and the process repeated to acquire an image of the desired resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows exemplary k-space trajectories that may be obtained using pulse sequence <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Each spoke represents the k-space trajectory due to the readout gradients. The dots represent the central points which are sampled on the gradient ramps, and the stars the peripheral points which are sampled on the gradient plateau. In some implementations, data acquisition includes 128-512 spokes and 256-512 points per spoke. The data points are generally re-gridded onto a Cartesian grid prior to 2D Fourier transformation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows slice profiles obtained using a pulse sequence such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The two half pulse excitations are denoted by (A) and (C). The slice profiles from these acquisitions are shown in (B) and (D), respectively, where the continuous line is the real component and the dashed line is the imaginary component. If the data in (B) and (D) are added in the complex domain, a narrow profile is obtained, as shown in (E). Conventional sequence slice selection (F) produces the profile shown in (G), which is the same as the profile shown in (E). The need for short RF pulses predicates against a sharp edged slice profile.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A number of additional techniques may be used with an ultra-short TE pulse sequence such as sequence <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. For example, techniques for suppressing unwanted signals (such as signals from longer T<sub>2 </sub>components and signals from fat) may be used. To suppress longer T<b>2</b> components and increase signal to noise ratio, inversion pulse techniques may be used. In an example, a pulse configured to invert longer T<sub>2 </sub>components may be generated. After an inversion time TI, the ultra-short TE pulse sequence may be generated. The inversion time TI is selected to reduce a contribution to the signal from the longer T<sub>2 </sub>components.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another technique, fat suppression may be combined with long T<sub>2 </sub>suppression. A fat suppression pulse may be generated. In order to suppress signal from longer T<sub>2 </sub>components, a 90 degree pulse may be generated to rotate the spins into the transverse plane. A gradient pulse may then be generated to de-phase the spins of the longer T<sub>2 </sub>components, thus reducing their signal contribution.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another technique, additional pulse sequences may be used in addition to one or more ultra-short TE pulse sequences. For example, an echo sequence such as a spin echo sequence or a gradient echo sequence may be generated. Data generated as a result of the echo sequence may be used to create a difference image by subtracting it from associated data of an ultra-short TE pulse sequence. In some implementations, multiple echo sequences may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Artifacts may also be reduced. For example, anti-aliasing techniques and/or random sampling may be used to reduce image artifacts. Contributions due to motion may be reduced using gating techniques. For example, pulse sequences may be generated based on a gate signal related to a cardiac signal and/or a breath hold signal. Contrast agents may be used to increase contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The UTE pulse sequences may be used to image thin slices. For example, slices as thin as about 2 mm or less may be imaged. In some implementations, other slice thicknesses may be imaged. For example, slices between about 2 mm and about 4 mm, or slices between about 4 mm and about 8 mm. The UTE pulse sequences described herein may be characterized by an echo time TE of about 80 microseconds or less.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Features of the basic physics relevant to UTE imaging are described herein, including the fact when the RF pulse duration is of the order of T<sub>2</sub>, rotation of tissue magnetization into the transverse plane is incomplete. Consequences of the broad linewidth of short T<sub>2 </sub>components are also discussed, including their partial saturation by off-resonance fat suppression pulses as well as multi-slice and multi-echo imaging. The benefits of rapid data acquisition-for example, on the order of T<sub>2</sub>-are also detailed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some implementations, a basic UTE pulse sequence including a half excitation pulse and radial imaging from the center of k-space may be used. In some implementations, other techniques may be used as well; for example, techniques for suppressing signals due to fat and/or signals due to relatively long T<sub>2 </sub>components.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Image interpretation is discussed. Clinical features of the imaging of cortical bone, tendons, ligaments, menisci and periosteum as well as brain, liver and spine are illustrated. Short T<sub>2 </sub>components in all of these tissues may show high signals.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">An effective strategy for diagnosis of parenchymal disease with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the use of heavily T<sub>2 </sub>weighted pulse sequences to detect an increase or decrease in signal from abnormal tissue. Even with newer pulse sequences such as fast spin echo, echo planar imaging, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion weighted imaging, the main diagnostic emphasis remains on detecting signal from tissues with long T<sub>2</sub>'s.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">From the earliest days of clinical MR it was recognized that there were also tissues such as cortical bone which had short T<sub>2</sub>'s. The MR signal from these tissues characteristically decays very rapidly, so that with the echo times (TE's) used in conventional clinical imaging they produce little or no signal, and so appear generally dark.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The low signal from cortical bone and other tissues with a short T<sub>2 </sub>provides a useful background against which to recognize abnormalities which produce an increase in signal. A disadvantage of this approach is that the absence of signal in the normal tissue means that there is little opportunity to manipulate conspicuity by using different pulse sequences or contrast agents. Clinically it has been difficult, and in certain cases not been possible, to characterize these tissues in MR terms, for example, by measuring their T<sub>1</sub>'s and T<sub>2</sub>'s.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">While tissues such as cortical bone, tendons, ligaments and menisci contain a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components, other tissues also contain short T<sub>2 </sub>components, but as a minority species. Signal from the short T<sub>2 </sub>components in these tissues may be difficult to detect. For example, with some conventional clinical pulse sequences, the MR signal comes from the majority of long T<sub>2 </sub>components.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In quantitative terms, using conventional 2D Fourier transform (2DFT) imaging with basic spin echo imaging sequences (with TE's down to about 8-10 ms), tissues with T<sub>2</sub>'s shorter than about 10 ms have not generally been detectable. Shorter TE's (for example, in the range of about 1-2 ms) may now be achieved using fast 2DFT gradient echo pulse sequences, which may lower the limit of detectable T<sub>2</sub>'s to a range of about 1-2 ms.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Pulse sequences with even shorter TE's (for example, in the range of approximately 0.05-0.20 ms) can be produced by use of half radiofrequency (RF) excitations with radial mapping from the center of k-space. These ultrashort TE (UTE) pulse sequences, have TE's about 10 to 20 times shorter than the shortest generally available on modern clinical systems. With these sequences, short T<sub>2 </sub>components found in cortical bone may be the largest contributors to the MR signal, despite their short T<sub>2 </sub>(about 0.42-0.50 ms).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a transverse image of a normal tibia. The image was obtained using ds STUTE techniques with magnitude reconstruction. TR/TE/TI were 650/0.08 minus 5.95/80 ms. Cortical bone is highlighted. It is surrounded by a dark cancellation line and low signal from adjacent muscle and fat. The T<sub>1 </sub>of cortical bone (130 ms) is shorter than other tissue in the image.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">What applies to cortical bone also applies to other tissues with a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components. In addition, using UTE pulse sequences, signal can be specifically detected from the short T<sub>2 </sub>components in tissues in which they are in a minority. For reference, ranges of TE's with different pulse sequences are listed in Table 2.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Note that the weighting depends on the T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2 </sub>of the tissue or fluid of interest. In this paper the term ultrashort has been used specifically to describe radial methods of data acquisition with TE's less than about 0.50 ms, although in the literature the terms ultrashort and short are not uniformly defined.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the course of developing the techniques described here, studies of 120 patients were conducted to test their clinical use in proton imaging. Results of these studies are described in this application</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">There has been a large volume of work published on the MR properties of tissue. Some tissue properties are important for imaging of short T<sub>2 </sub>components.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For the examples described here, we have used the term &#x201c;short T<sub>2</sub>&#x201d; to refer to T<sub>2 </sub>values of less than 10 ms. This, however, is intended as an example to illustrate the techniques of this application. Prior to the techniques outlined in this application, T<sub>2 </sub>values of less than 10 ms would have corresponded to the limit of clinical detectability with basic spin echo sequences. However, using UTE sequences, most tissues with short T<sub>2</sub>'s are detectable. The lower limit of useful detectability with UTE sequences may be between 0.1 and 0.01 ms or lower, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the earlier limit of about 10 ms, and an order of magnitude shorter than that with 2DFT gradient echo images. The limit closely parallels TE. Much of the discussion which follows relates to short T<sub>2</sub>'s in the lower short T<sub>2 </sub>range down to the limit of detectability with UTE sequences. The term extremely short can be applied to tissues which have T<sub>2</sub>'s shorter than this limit such as those in solids, proteins and other macromolecules. Estimated mean T<sub>2</sub>'s of some adult tissues and tissue components with short T<sub>2</sub>'s are listed in Table 3.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The sources for the data of Table 3 were adult clinical results, as well as tissue sample results estimated for 1.5 T. Tissues with long T<sub>2</sub>'s which undergo significant dephasing (such as nasal sinus mucosa) may have short T<sub>2</sub>*'s (&#x3c;10 ms) and thus appears similar to tissues with short T<sub>2</sub>'s.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It may be assumed that all tissues are heterogeneous and have components with different values of T<sub>2</sub>. For protons this follows from the fact that tissues contain protons in proteins (with very short T<sub>2</sub>'s of about 10 &#x3bc;s, or 0.01 ms) as well as protons in water with much longer T<sub>2</sub>'s. As a first approximation it is then possible to describe tissues as having both short and long T<sub>2 </sub>components, although most if not all tissues have more than two components (and thus more than two different T<sub>2 </sub>values). Although two component samples are discussed herein, the principles may be extended to embrace samples with three or more components (and thus, three or more applicable T<sub>2 </sub>values). As noted above, for the purposes of discussion, samples may be divided into those having a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components and those having a minority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components. Table 4 lists tissue types having a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components. Most other tissue types have a minority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in Table 4, the tissues with a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components include cortical bone, dentine and enamel (very short T<sub>2</sub>'s and always zero signal with conventional sequences) as well as other tissues where signal is low with conventional sequences but not always zero. The many tissues with a minority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components such as skeletal muscle, white matter and gray matter of the brain have these components present in low concentrations, typically of about 1-20%. Magnetization decay curves for these two groups of tissues are shown using conventional TE and UTE sequences in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, <b>5</b>A, and <b>5</b>B.</p>

The continuous line represents the total magnetization, the circles that of the short T<sub>2 </sub>components, and the dashes that of the long T<sub>2 </sub>components. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the signal has largely decayed to zero by the time of the data collection (dc) at TE and little or no signal is detected. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> the magnetization of the short T<sub>2 </sub>components has decayed to zero by the time of data collection at TE, but that of the long T<sub>2 </sub>components persists, and provides the detectable signal represented by the vertical arrow.</p>

In comparison to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the magnetization of the short T<sub>2 </sub>components is now detectable in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, and magnetization of both the short and long T<sub>2 </sub>components is detectable in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">There can be a number of causes for short T<sub>2</sub>'s in tissues. In general, solids have very short T<sub>2</sub>'s as a result of the strong dipolar interactions between substantially immobile nuclei. Protons in the crystalline component of bone have extremely short T<sub>2</sub>'s (less than 1 &#x3bc;s). Protons in macromolecules within membranes or in water closely bound to them are also relatively immobile and have short T<sub>2</sub>'s. Protons in water which is less tightly bound to large molecules have longer T<sub>2</sub>'s, eventually extending up to that of free water which has a T<sub>2 </sub>of about four seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Another cause of short T<sub>2</sub>'s is susceptibility effects in tissues which are diamagnetic or paramagnetic to different degrees so that their nuclei experience slightly different magnetic fields. This results in a net dephasing, with an attendant loss of signal. These magnetic interactions may be the dominant mechanism for producing short T<sub>2</sub>'s in a number of situations, particularly those involving paramagnetic species. Diffusion of water molecules in magnetically inhomogeneous tissue is another potential cause of short T<sub>2</sub>'s.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Tissues such as tendons and ligaments which contain a high proportion of linearly ordered collagen are of particular interest. Protons in water bound to collagen in these tissues typically manifest strong dipolar interactions which, unlike those in water bound to proteins in general, are dependent on the macroscopic orientation of the collagen fibres to the static magnetic field, B<sub>0</sub>. Their dipolar interactions are modulated by the term (3 cos <sup>2</sup>&#x3b8;&#x2212;1) where &#x3b8;is the angle the collagen fibres make to B<sub>0</sub>. Where &#x3b8;=55&#xb0;, 125&#xb0; etc. (the magic angle), 3 cos <sup>2</sup>&#x3b8;&#x2212;1=0, dipolar interactions are minimized and so T<sub>2 </sub>is increased. This effect has been recognized as a source of artifact in musculoskeletal imaging where tendons and ligaments may show a high signal when all or part of them happens to be orientated at 55&#xb0; to B<sub>0</sub>. It can also be used as a technique for increasing the T<sub>2 </sub>of tendons (e.g. from about 7 to about 23 ms) to bring their signal into the detectable range when imaging with conventional spin echo pulse sequence TE's.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Although lung was the first tissue imaged with UTE pulse sequences it is a rather special case. It has a low proton density, is particularly prone to susceptibility effects at lung-air interfaces, a large proportion of the signal comes from flowing blood and it is subject to respiratory motion. These make imaging of its short T<sub>2 </sub>components a considerable technical challenge.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In disease a variety of processes may increase the signal from short T<sub>2 </sub>components e.g. chronic fibrosis, calcification, components of hemorrhage at various stages, cellular infiltration, deposition of short T<sub>2 </sub>tissues (e.g. amyloid), iron deposition, deposition of other paramagnetics, malignant melanoma, thrombosis clots and emboli, cryoablation and administration of magnetic iron oxide particles (MIOP's). These processes may increase the concentration of the short T<sub>2 </sub>components by the addition of new tissue with a short T<sub>2 </sub>as well as by shortening the T<sub>2</sub>'s of the long T<sub>2 </sub>components in tissue. The signal from short T<sub>2 </sub>components may also be increased by shortening their T<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">There are also many processes which may decrease the signal from short T<sub>2 </sub>components. These include many of the diseases which typically increase tissue T<sub>1</sub>'s and T<sub>2</sub>'s such as edema, acute inflammation, infection, infarction and many tumors. Loss of order in a highly structured tissue such as collagen may also lead to a decrease in signal from its short T<sub>2 </sub>components. Reduction in signal from T<sub>2 </sub>components may also result from a decrease in their concentration, a decrease in their T<sub>2 </sub>into the extremely short T<sub>2 </sub>range and an increase in their T<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">This section outlines features of the MR physics which particularly apply to UTE imaging. During any radiofrequency (RF) pulse there is competition between the pulse tending to rotate the magnetization into the transverse plane and relaxation processes tending to decrease magnetization in the transverse plane. With long T<sub>2 </sub>species such as free water, relaxation during the RF pulse is minimal, and the magnetization of the protons is fully rotated through the specified flip angle (e.g. 90&#xb0;) into the transverse plane.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">However with short T<sub>2 </sub>species, where T<sub>2 </sub>is of the same magnitude as the duration of the RF pulse or shorter, relaxation processes dominate and the magnetization actually rotated into the transverse plane may be very much less than that expected from the nominal pulse flip angle. At the same time the longitudinal magnetization is partly saturated so that overall there is a reduction of magnetization in the transverse plane with a decrease in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a simulation of the magnetization trajectory during a 3 ms, 90 degree rectangular pulse, showing rotation of longitudinal magnetization (M<sub>z</sub>) into the transverse plane to become M<sub>xy </sub>for tissues with T<sub>2</sub>'s between 0.01 and 100 ms. For a tissue with a T<sub>2 </sub>of 100 ms, rotation is almost complete, but as T<sub>2 </sub>is decreased, less magnetization is rotated. For T<sub>2</sub>=0.01 ms, there is essentially no magnetization rotated into the transverse plane. M<sub>z </sub>is also reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Therefore, in sequences designed for imaging of short T<sub>2 </sub>species, short RF excitation pulses are used. It also means that the effective duration of an RF pulse is loaded towards its later stages for short T<sub>2 </sub>species, since these may relax significantly during the earlier stages of the pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some implementations, this situation may be exploited by purposely using pulses of long duration to selectively rotate long T<sub>2 </sub>components into the transverse plane but leave short T<sub>2 </sub>components largely unaffected. For example to reduce the signal from long T<sub>2 </sub>components, a long duration (e.g. about 10 ms) rectangular 90&#xb0; pulse may be used to rotate the long T<sub>2 </sub>components into the transverse plane and then de-phase them with crusher gradients while leaving the short T<sub>2 </sub>components largely unaffected.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">These considerations not only apply to 90&#xb0; and lower flip angle pulses, but also to inversion pulses. These are of necessity longer than 90&#xb0; pulses, and longer again if they are slice selected. Depending on the duration of the pulse, a short T<sub>2 </sub>tissue may be unaffected, saturated or rotated to various angles less than 180&#xb0; by such a pulse. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the effect of a short inversion pulse (0.50 ms) on magnetization M<sub>z</sub>, for tissues with different values of T<sub>2</sub>. The residual magnetization, M<sub>z</sub>,/M<sub>0</sub>, present after application of the pulse is plotted against T<sub>2</sub>. With T<sub>2</sub>'s of 100 ms or more, the magnetization is almost fully inverted (i.e. M<sub>z</sub>/M<sub>0 </sub>is about equal to negative one). However, for shorter T<sub>2</sub>'s (e.g., 0.01 ms), very little magnetization is inverted.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">While it can be very difficult to invert short T<sub>2 </sub>components, it is much easier to saturate them. To do this they need to be excited but the dephasing process is then very effective and very short T<sub>2 </sub>components may not even need a subsequent dephasing gradient pulse. As a result, methods of measuring T<sub>1</sub>'s of short T<sub>2 </sub>components which include inversion pulses are difficult, while those utilizing saturation pulses are relatively straightforward.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Another basic difference from conventional MR is the fact that short T<sub>2 </sub>components have broad linewidths and therefore may be saturated by off-resonance RF pulses. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> illustrate this principle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows a stylized spectrum of a tissue with a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows one with a minority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components. For each, amplitude (A) is plotted versus frequency (f).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The short T<sub>2 </sub>components have a broad line, while the long T<sub>2 </sub>components have a narrow line. The off-resonance pulse in (a) (arrow) saturates the broad line and reduces the signal which can be detected from these components with a UTE sequence. The off-resonance pulse in (b) (arrow) saturates the broad line which then exchanges with the larger narrow line (long T<sub>2</sub>) pool and produces a reduction in the magnetization detected from it with conventional TE sequences. With UTE sequences both the direct saturation of the short T<sub>2 </sub>components and the indirect effect on the long T<sub>2 </sub>components via magnetization transfer are detectable.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Saturation of short T<sub>2 </sub>components may occur in a number of ways. Fat suppression techniques with pulses 220-230 Hz off-resonance (at about 1.5T) are relatively close to the resonant frequency. They may thus partially saturate the broad lines of short T<sub>2 </sub>components, thereby reducing the signal available from them. For example, the signal may easily be decreased by 10-20% because of this effect.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The use of multislice and multiecho imaging, where slices are selected in different locations by use of different resonance frequency offsets, is another situation where reduction in signal from partial saturation of broad line components may occur. These effects may occur in addition to at least some saturation and signal reduction from short T<sub>2 </sub>components due to the deliberate application of off-resonance pulses with magnetization transfer (e.g. 1500 Hz off resonance at 1.5T).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">There are other differences from conventional imaging. The relatively rapid decay of the signal from short T<sub>2 </sub>components means that the time available for useful sampling of them is much less than that for long T<sub>2 </sub>components (which do not decay significantly during a typical data acquisition times, which range from about 10-20 ms). In contrast, the decay of signal attributable to short T<sub>2 </sub>components during the time during which data is being acquired can result in the loss of high resolution detail. For example, the amplitude of the signal may be sufficient when regions of k-space near the center are being mapped, the amplitude may be significantly lower (or even undetectable) when the outer regions of k-space are mapped.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates this effect. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows CUTE images of two 2 mm thick rubber straps (T<sub>2</sub>=0.8 ms) wrapped concentrically around 0.5 mm (right) and 1 mm (left) cardboard spacers. The straps gives a detectable signal, while the spacers do not. Images were acquired with 210 mm field of view (FOV), which should yield 0.4 mm spatial resolution. Rapid data acquisition (2 &#x3bc;s/point giving a 1 ms data collection) resolves the boundaries of the straps accurately (top left). With 4 &#x3bc;s/point sampling giving a data collection of 2 ms duration, there is some slight blurring (top right). With 8 &#x3bc;s/point and a data collection of 4 ms, blurring becomes obvious (bottom left) and with 16 &#x3bc;s/point and 8 ms data collection, blurring is so marked that the internal boundaries are hardly resolved at all.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The loss of definition is due to the rapid decay of the signal from the rubber straps during the data collection. This is minimal for shorter data acquisition times (e.g., when the acquisition is of 1 ms duration and thus only slightly greater than the 0.8 ms T<sub>2 </sub>of the straps, but is obvious for a data acquisition time of 8 ms (approximately ten times longer than the T<sub>2 </sub>of the straps).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The distinction between T<sub>2 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>* is significant in this context. T<sub>2 </sub>is the spin-spin relaxation time and is a fundamental property of tissue (at a specific field strength, temperature etc.). It may be measured (for example) with a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence, using a series of phase alternated inversion pulses. The measurement may, within fairly broad limits, give values of T<sub>2 </sub>largely independent of the measurement technique.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">On the other hand, T<sub>2</sub>* is the relaxation time observed with a gradient echo pulse sequence. T<sub>2</sub>* includes both T<sub>2 </sub>relaxation and coherent dephasing effects, which are generally highly dependent on the imaging technique used. These dephasing effects arise from spins within a voxel (a volume element) that have different precessional frequencies. The difference in frequency is affected by voxel dimensions, including slice thickness. In general, the larger the voxel, the greater the field inhomogeneity within it, and the greater the dephasing effect. Specification of T<sub>2</sub>* thus requires a knowledge of voxel size and field inhomogeneity within it.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The difference between T<sub>2 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>* may be reduced if TE is decreased. For example, decreasing TE from a value of about 10 ms to about 0.1 ms or less may significantly reduce the difference between T<b>2</b> and T<sub>2</sub>*. Dephasing effects due to (for example) poor shimming or inhomogeneity in large voxels at air-tissue interfaces may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">When imaging particular tissue using a gradient echo sequence type, it may be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether changes in T<sub>2 </sub>or T<sub>2</sub>* are being observed, in the absence of additional information. In tissues that are known to contain no dephasing sources it may be reasonable to assume that the measurement essentially reflects T<sub>2</sub>. In other tissues (for example cortical bone), that assumption may not be accurate, since dephasing effects may be affecting the signal even at ultra-short TE's.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Magnetization transfer in clinical MR imaging can be used to provide access to the otherwise undetectable short T<sub>2 </sub>components in tissue. By applying off-resonance RF pulses it is possible to saturate the short T<sub>2 </sub>(broad line) components while leaving the long T<sub>2 </sub>(narrow line) components unaffected, and to detect the effect of this saturation through the exchange that occurs between the otherwise undetectable short T<sub>2 </sub>components and the detectable long T<sub>2 </sub>components which are imaged. This indirect technique for imaging of short T<sub>2 </sub>components has advantages over conventional techniques in applications such as detecting abnormalities in normal-appearing white matter. The technique is applicable to tissues with a minority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components (since they also have long T<sub>2 </sub>components which provide the detectable signal) and to tissues where the short and long T<sub>2 </sub>components are in exchange. Magnetization transfer can provide indirect access to very short T<sub>2 </sub>components (e.g. with T<sub>2</sub>'s of about 1-10 &#x3bc;s) which may not be directly detectable with UTE imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">To put clinical MR system performances in context, it is worth noting the performance of imaging spectrometers used for solid state studies on small samples (milligrams or grams) with very short T<sub>2</sub>'s. Typically these systems utilize short RF pulses (e.g., about 1-2 &#x3bc;s duration) with high peak power, a broad bandwidth and rectangular pulse profiles. The spectrometer can switch very rapidly from transmit to receive mode (e.g. in about 1 &#x3bc;s or less), so signal loss due to the rapid decay of short T<sub>2 </sub>components is minimized. Available gradient strengths (over a very small field of view) are much higher and rise times much shorter than those on clinical systems. In addition, B<sub>0</sub>'s are usually higher providing a greater signal to noise ratio. Biological safety issues are not a concern with inanimate samples.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In comparison, when examining humans (with masses on the order of kilograms) on clinical MR systems, transmitter coils are large, and B<sub>1 </sub>power limitations generally mean that the shortest RF pulses are of the order of 0.25 to 0.40 ms in duration (depending on flip angle). This value is similar to that of the T<sub>2 </sub>of tissues such as cortical bone as well as that of the short T<sub>2 </sub>components in other tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Most clinical MR systems are used primarily to image long T<sub>2 </sub>components. Thus, there has been no particular demand for rapid switching from transmit to receive mode. Typical minimum switching times are of the order of about 0.08 ms to about 0.10 ms. These switching times are long enough to allow generally highly resonant transmitter coils time to ring down. However, a significant proportion of the signal from short T<sub>2 </sub>components may be lost with switching times of these magnitudes.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Gradient performance, first to ramp the gradients up, and then to maintain them at a high amplitude is of importance when imaging tissues or tissue components with short T<sub>2</sub>'s. As a general rule, the duration of useful data collection for a short T<sub>2 </sub>component is of the order of T<sub>2</sub>, or twice T<sub>2</sub>. If gradient performance is limited both in slew rate and maximum strength, a significant proportion of the short T<sub>2 </sub>signal may be lost before it can be spatially encoded.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">With conventional 2DFT imaging, there is a delay after the initial RP excitation when the slice selection gradient is used to re-phase the signal. Time is also required for the phase encoding pulses, the initial dephasing lobe of the frequency encoding pulse, and the first half of the data acquisition before the center of k-space is reached. The term 2DFT is used to describe rectilinear mapping of k-space, such as that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. 2DFT is also known as phase-frequency encoding or spin-warp imaging, although both this method and UTE sequences such as sequence <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> use 2D Fourier transforms to reconstruct the image (after the data has been re-gridded, in the case of UTE imaging).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">It is possible to avoid the need for rephasing of the slice selective RF excitation pulse by first collecting the data with the slice selection gradient in one direction and adding this to data collected in the same way with the slice selection gradient reversed, as described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>. At the end of this process the signal is effectively in-phase and data sampling can, in principle, begin as soon as the RF pulse and the slice selection gradient are ramped down to zero. The use of radial imaging of k-space with the acquisition starting in the center of k-space (where no gradient is required for the initial encoding) means that there is no need for a phase-encoding gradient, a read-dephasing gradient, or additional time to get back to the center of k-space in the read direction.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Additionally, data sampling can continue while the gradient is being ramped up (although sampling during ramping takes a longer time than when the gradient is fully ramped up, by a factor of about two) as well as after the gradient has reached its plateau. The gradient also needs to be ramped down very quickly at end of the RF excitation since persistence of the gradient after the end of the RF pulse may result in dephasing of the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">It is usual to take TE as the time from the mid-point of the RF excitation pulse to that of the sampling of the center point of k-space. This is appropriate (or only slightly in error) for long T<sub>2 </sub>components, but the precise value of TE may become uncertain with short T<sub>2 </sub>components. The effectiveness of the RF pulse is biased towards the end of excitation for short T<sub>2 </sub>components so the end point of the RF excitation may be more appropriate to use as the time origin for TE.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The pulse sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is not a spin echo or gradient recalled echo (since reversed gradients are not used to form an echo). The pulse sequence detects the free induction decay (FID) directly. There is no echo since the signal is not refocused and each half excitation is not fully rephased. It is only after they are added that the k space data is in phase. Echoes are formed with most types of clinical imaging and for simplicity it is usual to regard the UTE sequence as a type of gradient echo.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">While simple UTE sequences are effective for imaging tissues with a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components, some form of long T<sub>2 </sub>component reduction may be used to selectively image short T<sub>2 </sub>components in tissues in which they are a minority.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">One method that may be used to reduce signal contributions from longer T<sub>2 </sub>components is to use a long (e.g. 10 ms) rectangular 90&#xb0; pulse followed by a dephasing gradient, as outlined above. Another method involves the use of an initial long inversion preparation pulse (e.g. about 4 ms) to selectively invert long T<sub>2 </sub>components followed by a TI chosen to null them. This technique requires at least some knowledge of the T<sub>1 </sub>of the long T<sub>2 </sub>components. Comparison with the same procedure but making use of a short inversion pulse (e.g. about 0.40 ms) in an attempt to simultaneously invert both long and short components provides a measure of the effectiveness of the technique.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates the effectiveness of these methods for signal suppression of longer T<sub>2 </sub>components. The total magnetization is shown as a continuous line, the short T<sub>2 </sub>components as circles and the long T<sub>2 </sub>components as dashes. Reduction of the long T<sub>2 </sub>components in reduces the detectable magnetization to that from the short T<sub>2 </sub>components (vertical arrow).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">A third method is to subtract a later echo image from the first (UTE) one and produce a difference image. Tissues or fluids with a long T<sub>2 </sub>have their signal attenuated by this procedure, while tissues which have a short T<sub>2 </sub>and decay rapidly between the two echoes are highlighted on the resulting difference image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates the effectiveness of this method for signal suppression of longer T<sub>2 </sub>components. Again, the total magnetization is shown as a continuous line, the short T<sub>2 </sub>components as circles and the long T<sub>2 </sub>components as dashes. The subtraction of the second echo from the first produces a difference image, in which most of the signal comes from the short T<sub>2 </sub>components, since they decay rapidly between the two echoes.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Pulse sequences employing half RF pulses and radial sampling have been applied to lung imaging. This implementation incorporated spectroscopic imaging and a modified Dixon technique for separation of fat and water signals as well as a 90&#xb0; rectangular preparation pulse for suppression of long T<sub>2 </sub>components. Pulse sequences with half RF excitations and center out radial mapping of k-space with TE's of about 0.07 to about 0.08 ms have been implemented, but in a more modular form. This is discussed more fully below.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Truncated RF pulses of with durations from about 0.40 to 0.50 ms may be used with slice selective gradients applied in one direction and then reversed for the second half of the acquisition. The two sets of data are added to give a single radial line of k-space, and the process is repeated through 360&#xb0; in 128-512 steps. The data is mapped onto a 512&#xd7;512 grid and reconstructed by 2D Fourier transformation to give a gradient echo type of image. In some implementations, four sets of images with typical TE's of 0.08, 2.87, 5.66 and 8.45 ms (at 2 &#x3bc;s per analog to digital converter [ADC] sample) or 0.08, 5.95, 11.08 and 17.70 ms (at 4 &#x3bc;s per ADC sample) are obtained. The length of the ADC sample point during the acquisition represents a compromise between (at 2 &#x3bc;s) acquiring data before the signal had significantly decayed (but at a wide bandwidth which decreased signal to noise ratio), and (at 4 &#x3bc;s) acquiring data for longer which allows the signal to decay further (but with a narrower bandwidth and hence increased signal to noise ratio). In some implementations, data is usually sampled over 256-512 points.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Slice selection in multislice sets is performed with sequential excitations with the positive gradient, followed by sequential excitations with the negative gradient. Multislice interleaved excitations may interfere directly with the half RF pulse, since the slice profile of a half pulse alone is spread out.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Versions of the basic sequence with frequency based fat suppression and/or long T<sub>2 </sub>component suppression have been implemented. Initial short (0.40 ms) and long (4 ms) inversion pulses are used as preparation pulses. With each variant of the sequence, difference images formed by subtraction of subsequent echo images from the first echo image are produced. Fields of view of 12-40 cm are employed with slice thicknesses of 4-8 mm. 2-20 multiple interleaved slices are obtained. TR's of about 500 ms are commonly used with CUTE and FUTE sequences with flip angles (for long T<sub>2 </sub>components) of 45-80&#xb0; and slice gaps of 10-100%. Serial studies of contrast uptake use a TR of 50-100 ms. Inversion recovery sequences had TR's of 650-2500 ms. Breathold and cardiac gated sequences use TR's of 10 ms. Scan time varied from 12.8 s to 17 minutes. Studies were performed on Sonata 1.5T systems (Siemens, Erlangen).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">To measure T<sub>1 </sub>values in short T<sub>2 </sub>species (e.g. for cortical bone) a saturation pulse was used with a series of saturation recovery delays (TSR) prior to excitation and acquisition. Analysis involved the placement of regions of interest within the tissues, subtraction of the signal from long T<sub>2 </sub>components and fitting of the resulting intensity versus TSR curves to a saturation recovery model.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">To measure T<sub>2</sub>* values (e.g. for cortical bone) TE's for the first echo of 0.14, 0.30, 0.46, 0.78, 1.10, 1.52, 1.94, 2.46 ms were used with a TR of 500 ms. Analysis involved placement of regions of interest and fitting the resulting intensity versus TE curves to an exponential decay with an offset (due to the presence of small concentrations of long T<sub>2 </sub>components).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">To summarize, several notable features of UTE sequences are listed below:</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Preparation pulses: With UTE sequences, preparation pulses similar to conventional pulses may be used, but inversion pulses may only effect long T<sub>2 </sub>components. Long inversion pulses can be used for nulling of these T<sub>2 </sub>components. Magnetization transfer pulses may directly saturate short T<sub>2 </sub>components and diminish their signal. Fat saturation and multiple slice multiple echo imaging may do the same.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">RF excitation and slice selection: for short T<sub>2 </sub>components, RF excitation is short, and usually less than the T<sub>2 </sub>of the components of interest. The RF pulse may be truncated. Slice selection may be achieved in two halves with reversed gradients, to avoid the need for a rephasing gradient lobe. Data acquisition may begin as soon as each half of the slice selection is completed, within limits that may be posed by RF switching times.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Mapping of k-space: Radial mapping from the center of k-space is performed (without phase encoding pulses), including acquisition during the ramping up of the gradient. This should be completed in a time of the order of the T<sub>2 </sub>of the tissue of interest. Data acquisition is generally performed at wide bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Post acquisition: Subtraction of later echoes from the first may be used to selectively reduce the signal from long T<sub>2 </sub>components.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In some implementations, contrast agents may be used. For example, intravenous Gadolinium chelates (e.g. Gadodiamide 0.3 mmol/kg) may show enhancement in tissues when imaging tissues with short T<sub>2</sub>'s using UTE sequences. Using conventional sequences, no appreciable signal from the short T<sub>2 </sub>signal may be detected, either before or after contrast administration. However, administration of the contrast agents may be effective with UTE sequences, due to a reduction of T<sub>1</sub>. The use of such contrast agents (and/or other methods of reducing T<sub>1</sub>) may be of particular interest because some tissues with a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components are avascular or relatively avascular. Contrast enhancement may thus allow solute transport or perfusion to be studied. The detection of normal enhancement in tissues with short T<sub>2</sub>'s may allow a reduction in this enhancement to be recognized in disease (see discussion below, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>). Even in tissues where signals are detectable with conventional sequences, the signals from the majority of longer T<sub>2 </sub>tissues may be detected earlier during their decay, and signal from the minority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components may also be detected. This may allow the tissue to be visualized with a higher signal intensity before enhancement and to show a greater increase in signal after enhancement (see discussion below, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Another feature of interest with UTE sequences is that UTE sequences may be able to detect signals from tissues with short T<sub>2</sub>'s and concurrently reduce or suppress signals from tissues or fluids with a long T<sub>2</sub>'s. This can be achieved by the use of different long T<sub>2 </sub>reduction techniques. This option may be useful with contrast enhancement with Gadolinium chelates where frequently the greatest change is seen in blood (which has a long T<sub>2</sub>) but the area of most clinical interest may be adjacent or associated tissue with a short T<sub>2 </sub>(see discussion below and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Magnetic iron oxide particles (MIOP's) typically produce a loss of signal through susceptibility effects. This loss of signal may not be manifest with conventional sequences in tissues which produce no signal prior to enhancement such as tendons and ligaments. In this situation, the presence of these particles may be inferred by loss of signal in surrounding tissues or fluids which have detectable MR signals. The use of UTE sequences to produce a detectable signal in the tissues of interest may provide a baseline to recognize a reduction in this signal produced by MIOP's.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">A particular problem with intravenous use of MIOP's is that MIOP's frequently produce a loss of signal in the area of most interest, which may make image interpretation difficult. (Gadolinium chelates, as most commonly used clinically, do the reverse, by increasing the signal in the area of most interest). Also, with the use of oral MIOP's to reduce the unwanted signal from bowel contents, the loss of signal may extend beyond bowel and produce loss of signal in adjacent organs.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">UTE images typically show low sensitivity to susceptibility effects but later echo images show higher sensitivity to these effects. Subtraction of a subsequent echo from the first produces a difference image in which the anatomic detail from the first (UTE) image is well preserved but modulated by the susceptibility dependent contrast developed by the later echo, with higher signal on the difference image representing a greater degree of susceptibility effect.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The interpretation of UTE images follows established principles, but there are some interesting differences. The term &#x201c;T<sub>2 </sub>weighted&#x201d; as usually applied to a pulse sequence is generally taken to mean weighting for long T<sub>2</sub>, components in a tissue or fluid by use of a long TR and long TE. Sequences may also be T<sub>2 </sub>weighted, but for short T<sub>2 </sub>components (e.g. with T<sub>2</sub>'s less than 10 ms), using short TE's rather than long ones. For clarity, in situations where there may be confusion, it may be necessary to use the terms &#x201c;long T<sub>2 </sub>weighted&#x201d; and &#x201c;short T<sub>2 </sub>weighted&#x201d;. Sequences may be both short T<sub>2 </sub>and T<sub>1 </sub>weighted at the same time if they have a short TE and a short TR, or just short T<sub>2 </sub>weighted if they have a short TE and long TR (relative to T<sub>1</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The T<sub>2 </sub>weighting of a sequence is maximal for small increases or decreases in the T<sub>2 </sub>of a tissue when its TE is about the same as the tissue T<sub>2</sub>. So UTE sequences alone (e.g. TE=0.08 ms) are not particularly T<sub>2 </sub>weighted for most tissues in the short T<sub>2 </sub>range since these tissues often have longer T<sub>2</sub>'s. Although the T<sub>2 </sub>weighting of UTE sequences is low for most short T<sub>2 </sub>tissues, T<sub>2 </sub>weighting increases for tissues in the short T<sub>2 </sub>range with later echoes (e.g., with TE=2.87, 5.66 and 8.45 ms). These may detect an increase or decrease in signal intensity in disease relative to normal tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The long T<sub>2 </sub>reduction techniques also affect T<sub>2 </sub>weighting, but in a different way. They selectively attenuate the signal from tissues with long T<sub>2</sub>'s, leaving the signal from short T<sub>2 </sub>components. As a result, the sequence only shows signal from tissues with T<sub>2</sub>'s within a restricted range or window.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Tissues may enter or leave this window of visibility at either end by increasing or decreasing their T<sub>2</sub>'s. The width of the window varies with the duration of the rectangular pulse, the length of the nulling inversion pulse, or the TE of the subtracted echo. Within the window the above consideration about the choice of TE in relation to T<sub>2 </sub>apply. The situation may be complicated by tissues having two or more components in the short T<sub>2 </sub>range present in significant concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates this effect. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a stylised sensitivity (S) profile of a UTE sequence to tissues with different T<sub>2</sub>'s, shown on a logarithmic scale. The lower cut off point was set by machine performance, and is probably between 0.01 and 0.1 ms. Without T<sub>2 </sub>reduction, the sequence is sensitive to T<sub>2 </sub>components in the range of 1-10 ms and higher (dashed line). With T<sub>2 </sub>reduction techniques, the sensitivity to longer T<sub>2</sub>'s is reduced to zero (continuous line). There is thus a window of short T<sub>2</sub>'s which UTE sequences with long T<sub>2 </sub>reduction techniques are sensitive to. Tissues can enter or leave this window of visibility by increasing or decreasing their T<sub>2</sub>'s. Note that the graph does not take into account differences in concentration of T<sub>2 </sub>species, or the effects of T<sub>1</sub>. Both of these factors affect the detectable signal.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">UTE sequences are T<sub>1 </sub>weighted if the TR for CUTE, FUTE, LUTE and FLUTE sequences is about the T<sub>1 </sub>of the tissue of interest, with due allowance for flip angle. This is a common situation. With inversion recovery sequences, T<sub>1 </sub>weighting is maximal if the TI is about the T<sub>1 </sub>of interest. Cortical bone has a T<sub>1 </sub>in young and middle-aged subjects of 130-160 ms at 1.5T, which is shorter than subcutaneous fat. The T<sub>1 </sub>of cortical bone increases significantly with age to 260-280 ms in the ninth decade. Tendons, ligaments and menisci have relatively short T<sub>1</sub>'s in the range of 300-600 ms at 1.5T. T<sub>1</sub>'s of short T<sub>2 </sub>components in tissues in which they are in a minority are less well characterized but are probably similar.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Conventional proton density weighted pulse sequences with typical TR's of about 2000-3000 ms and TE's of about 10-20 ms do not detect a number of short T<sub>2 </sub>components which contribute to proton density as measured by chemical assay. Even UTE sequences may not detect extremely short T<sub>2 </sub>components (although these components may be imaged using magnetization transfer, as outlined above). However, changes in proton density may be a greater source of contrast when imaging with short T<sub>2 </sub>components than is the case with long T<sub>2 </sub>components.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">With inversion recovery sequences, the use of a long initial inversion pulse may mean that long T<sub>2 </sub>components may experience an inversion recovery sequence, while short T<sub>2 </sub>components experience a partial saturation type of sequence since they do not experience the inversion pulse. Thus, with long TR's, short T<sub>2 </sub>components may be fully recovered while long T<sub>2 </sub>components may still be recovering their longitudinal magnetization after the inversion pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Each of the long T<sub>2 </sub>reduction techniques has advantages and disadvantages. Long T<sub>2 </sub>component suppression with a long preceding 90&#xb0; pulse and dephasing has the disadvantage that no unsuppressed image is available, but the advantage that susceptibility effects are not introduced by subtraction of a later echo. However, susceptibility effects may render the long narrow bandwidth pulse ineffective, and result in high unsuppressed signal from long T<sub>2 </sub>components. The long inversion pulse sequences with nulling of long T<sub>1 </sub>components may be difficult to interpret, due to magnitude processing and concerns about whether the chosen TI is correct. Subtraction images generally increase the noise level and introduce susceptibility effects, but both the original images and the subtracted image are available for examination.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">With LUTE, FLUTE and 1 STUTE sequences, comparison of the first and subsequent echo signal intensities using difference images provides a measure of the success of the long T<sub>2 </sub>reduction technique. If there is considerable reduction of signal between the two echoes then what is being imaged is mainly short T<sub>2 </sub>components.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Changes induced by susceptibility effects may be obvious on later echo images and may not require subtraction from the first UTE to make them obvious if they are seen against a uniform tissue background. Subtraction may be more useful at interfaces and other regions where there is complex anatomy (e.g. with meninges and blood vessel walls), or where it may be desired to visualize short T<sub>2 </sub>components without confounding effects from tissues or fluids with long T<sub>2</sub>'s such as contrast enhanced blood.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">To selectively show short T<sub>2 </sub>components, subtraction images need to have adequate signal to noise ratio. Thus, cortical bone may be obvious in a subtraction image when it is situated close to a surface coil, but be of low signal on all sequences (including subtraction images) when examined at some distance away from the conductors of a body coil.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">When double inversion recovery pulses (&#x201c;black blood pulses&#x201d;) are used to reduce the signal from blood, the two inversion pulses may saturate the signal from short T<sub>2 </sub>components in vessel walls.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Magic angle effects in tendons and ligaments are manifest as a relatively increased in signal on later echo images (due to the longer T<sub>2</sub>) and a decrease in signal on difference images. These can be seen in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), on the femoral side of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) as well as at other sites.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The conspicuity of increased or decreased signal from short T<sub>2 </sub>components within a tissue differs, depending on whether these components are in a tissue with a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components or in a tissue with a minority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components where the effect may be diluted unless the signal from the signal from long T<sub>2 </sub>component is reduced. Likewise, the effect of a T<sub>2 </sub>shortening process may be more obvious in a tissue with a minority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components than in one with a majority where there are no long T<sub>2 </sub>components available in the tissue to have their T<sub>2 </sub>reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Even when it is not necessary to reduce the signal from long T<sub>2 </sub>components in a tissue of interest with a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components to visualize them (e.g. tendons, ligaments), it may still be useful to do this in order to increase the conspicuity of these tissues by reducing the signal from other tissues with a minority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Diseases which increase the T<sub>2 </sub>of tissues with a majority of short T<sub>2 </sub>components may render them more obvious on later echo images but less obvious on difference images (i.e. the increase in T<sub>2 </sub>takes them outside the visible window in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). With conventional pulse sequences, contrast enhancement in these tissues (e.g. tendons and ligaments) may only be recognizable in areas where the T<sub>2 </sub>is increased so that signal is detectable. Paradoxically, with difference images, these may be just the areas where contrast enhancement is not visible on difference images, because the increased T<sub>2 </sub>leads to attenuation of the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Tissues with long T<sub>2</sub>'s but short T<sub>2</sub>*'s are common at tissue-air interfaces. Susceptibility effects affecting the mucosa of the nasal sinuses are obvious with later echoes and on difference images. Fatty bone marrow within trabecular bone contain significant short T<sub>2</sub>* components. Large bowel contents typically have a short T<sub>2 </sub>and/or T<sub>2</sub>* and display a high signal on UTE and difference images derived from them. The signal at the lung bases on subtraction images seen in normal volunteers probably represents a short T<sub>2</sub>* effect due to susceptibility effects either from fluid in lung or blood. Lung has short T<sub>2 </sub>components as well as short T<sub>2</sub>* components.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Particular artifacts associated with the use of UTE sequences include radial lines, susceptibility effects, out-of-slice effects, flow dephasing effects and effects due to delayed RF switching. Radial artifacts resemble those seen with cat scans (CT). Susceptibility artifacts may be manifest as high signal on difference images. However, within cortical bone they may produce a relative increase in signal on late echo images and have a low signal (rather than a high signal) within the bone on difference images.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Out-of-slice artifacts can produce high signal at boundaries or interfaces. Materials with short T<sub>2</sub>'s in the receiver coils often have a high signal. Plastic inter-uterine contraceptive devices (IUCD's) also have a high signal, as do various items of clothing. Bone may be diamagnetic to a different degree than other tissues and this may result in phase cancellation at boundaries. Large artifactual changes on difference images can arise from subtraction of later out-of-phase (fat and water protons) echo images from the first (UTE) image. Motion artifact is generally more prominent with later echoes, and generally becomes more obvious on difference images. Flow of blood can lead to dephasing on the later echo images and a high signal on difference images which simulates signal from short T<sub>2 </sub>components. Delay in coil switching and/or eddy currents may produce a mottled effect, and a relative reduction of the first echo compared with the second, with negative signals on difference images.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">To date we have studied over 120 patients using the techniques described above. The selection of patient groups follows from a number of considerations. The detection of signal from tissues with short T<sub>2</sub>'s which have previously been &#x201c;invisible&#x201d; provides a new range of conspicuity options as well as new anatomic detail which has previously been submerged in low tissue signal. Pathologic processes which might either increase or decrease the signal from short T<sub>2 </sub>components (as outlined in section 2) have also provided a guide for the use of UTE sequences. Applications in which conventional imaging has been relatively unrewarding but in which magnetization transfer, MR spectroscopy or other imaging techniques have shown abnormalities have been another focus of attention.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The proton signal from cortical bone probably comes mainly from the organic matrix (principally collagen), bound water and some free water. It may provide different information than conventional radiological methods, which mainly reflect the calcium content of the mineral component. Serial scanning shows enhancement in normal cortical bone. After intravenous Gadodiamide there was a 23% increase in signal with a peak at about 10 minutes in the study illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows signal intensities in cortical bone after fracture of the tibia. Intravenous Gadodiamide was administered after five minutes. Results in one patient four days after fracture (squares), may be compared with those in another 3&#xbd; months after fracture (circles). There is a faster and higher increase in signal in the patient imaged 3&#xbd; months after his fracture.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The periosteum is well seen in many areas, although there may be other causes of high signal adjacent to cortical bone, and periosteum should to be differentiated from these. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a normal tibia, imaged using transverse d FUTE (TR/TE=500/0.08 minus 5.95 ms). The periosteum (arrow) is highlighted. Enhancement may be specifically demonstrated in the periosteum without the confounding effect of high signal from blood by the use of subtraction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14D</figref> show images of a fracture of the tibial plateau three days after injury. Coronal FUTE (TR/TE=500/0.08 ms) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>) and d FUTE (TR/TE=500/0.08 minus 5.95 ms) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>) images before enhancement and the same FUTE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>) and d FUTE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>) images after enhancement. The periosteum is just seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>. Marked enhancement of blood vessels and other tissues is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, but subtraction specifically shows the enhanced periosteum in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref> (arrows).</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">High signal was consistently seen in ligaments. Local enhancement may be seen after injury. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref> are sagittal d FUTE (TR/TE=500/0.08 minus 11.08 ms) images of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) before (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>) and after (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>) enhancement. A focal area of enhancement is seen on the tibial side of the ligament (arrow).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a plot of signal intensity versus TE for the normal posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), before and after contrast enhancement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows that the highest baseline signal and the largest increase in signal are seen in this short T<sub>2 </sub>tissue with the shortest TE. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> was obtained using a CUTE sequence and subsequent echoes (TR/TE=500/0.08, 5.95, 11.08 and 17.70 ms) for a normal PCL before and after contrast enhancement. The PCL shows the highest pre-enhancement signal and the greatest increase in signal with the shortest TE (0.08 ms).</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The red (vascular) zone of the meniscus is well seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>. It has not been identifiable in previous studies in cadavers or patients. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> are sagittal d FUTE (TR/TE=0.08 minus 17.70 ms) images before (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>) and after (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>) enhancement. The red (vascular) zone of the meniscus is enhanced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> (arrows).</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Regions of abnormality may be identified using the systems and techniques described herein. They may show less enhancement than that seen in normal tissue. This has not been possible previously in tissues in which normal enhancement could not be visualised. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A to 18C</figref> are transverse CUTE (TR/TE=500/0.08 ms) images of the Achilles tendon after contrast enhancement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>), second echo (TR/TE=500/5.95) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>) and d CUTE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>) images formed from a subtraction of data for the image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> from the data for the image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>. The tendon shows two low signal areas in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>. The smaller one has an increased T<sub>2 </sub>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> but the other does not. The larger area has enhanced less than the surrounding normal tendon.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In another example, the liver shows an increased signal on difference images in hemochromatosis, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a d FUTE image (TR/TE=500/0.08 minus 17.70 ms). With cirrhosis, there is a tendency towards an increase in T<sub>2</sub>*. The fibrosis present in this condition may be associated with inflammatory change and a long T<sub>2</sub>* rather than the short T<sub>2</sub>* seen in chronic &#x201c;dry&#x201d; fibrosis. There may also be a loss of endoplasmic reticulum and tightly bound water reducing the concentration of short T<sub>2 </sub>components.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows tendons and muscle insertions are highlighted in the pelvis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a d FUTE image (TR/TR=500/0.08 minus 5.95 ms). The strong signal may be from fibrocartilage.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Short T<sub>2</sub>* components can be seen in the normal white matter of the brain, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a dl STUTE image (TR/TE/TI=2500/0.08 minus 5.95/360 ms). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the long T<sub>2 </sub>components in the white matter have been nulled, leaving the short T<sub>2 </sub>components (with a mean T<sub>2 </sub>of about 3 ms) as high signal areas.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Applications in the brain have included conditions in which the signal from short T<sub>2</sub>* components is increased such as angiomas, malignant melanomas, calcification and chronic gliosis as well as those in which it is decreased such as multiple sclerosis, many tumors, and vasogenic edema. Meningeal thickening is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> is a conventional 2DFT T<sub>1 </sub>weighted (TR/TE=500/8 ms) image, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> is a d CUTE (TR/TE=500/0.08 minus 5.95 ms) image. Normal meninges are well seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>. There is thickening at the site of a previous craniotomy (arrows).</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Cardiac imaging has been performed with adequate signal to noise ratio and scar tissue with a short T<sub>2</sub>* has been identified as a high signal region on difference images.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Imaging of the spine shows increased signal from ligaments and scar tissue and may show enhancement of abnormal interspinous ligaments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a sagittal contrast enhanced FUTE (TR/TE=500/0.08 ms) image, showing degenerative disease of the spine. Enhancement is seen in discs and scar tissue as well as the interspinous ligaments (arrows).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Thalassemia is of interest as a condition in which there is premature intervertebral disc degeneration in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. High intensity bands can be seen parallel to the end plates with FLUTE sequences. These may be due to iron deposition shortening the T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2 </sub>of the disc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> is a sagittal normal spine image obtained with a FLUTE sequence (TR/TE=500/0.08 ms), while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> is an image of a patient with thalassemia obtained using the same sequence as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>. High signal bands are seen parallel to the end plates within the discs on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Many other implementations are possible. Parameters, such as TR, flip angle and data sampling techniques for different tissue T<sub>1</sub>'s and T<sub>2</sub>'s may be optimized. Different and/or additional long T<sub>2 </sub>signal reduction techniques may be used. In general, fast low flip angle techniques are likely to form the basic pattern for UTE imaging. The T<sub>1</sub>'s of short T<sub>2 </sub>components are generally short, which assists with fast sequences. The technique is also well suited to low flip angles, in order to keep RF pulse durations short.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Hardware may be used that optimizes B<sub>1 </sub>power and reduces RF switching times, which may be inadequate for some coils (at TE of 0.08 ms). For example, MRI systems that provide for increased B<sub>1 </sub>power and gradient strength with smaller dedicated transmit-receive coils and gradient sets for imaging of the brain, knee and other parts of the body may be used. These should allow shorter RF pulses and faster ramping to higher gradient strengths. For MR system hardware as a whole, it may be beneficial to provide a system capable of TE down to 20 &#x3bc;s or less, peak B<sub>1 </sub>field of 30 &#x3bc;T or more, gradient slew rate of 200 T/m or faster, and gradient strength of 50 T/m or more.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">3D acquisitions may be used to improve signal to noise ratio and for imaging complex structures such as articular cartilage and joints with thinner slices to minimise partial volume effects. Reversed radial sampling may improve the signal to noise ratio for later echoes. Gradient moment nulling is likely to be of value in reducing motion artifact from later echoes.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Spiral acquisitions also proceed from the center of k space and may provide more efficient coverage of k-space than radial sampling, although they generally take longer and this may lead to greater T<sub>2 </sub>decay during data collection.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">There may also be sequences in which the first &#x201c;echo&#x201d; is of the UTE type but later echoes use a conventional readout so that the sequence as a whole generates both types of image in a single acquisition. The combination of UTE gradient echoes and spin echoes for the later echoes would also remove some of the susceptibility artifacts that may be present with subtraction from the later gradient echoes. The radial approach is also compatible with partially parallel imaging techniques given adequate signal to noise ratio. This could allow faster imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">An interesting feature of some UTE sequences is that the center of k space is over-sampled so that the signal to noise ratio of low frequency components is higher than that of high frequency components. This may result in useful tissue contrast in particular clinical situations.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">By combining UTE and magnetization transfer imaging, it may be possible to observe MT effects due to extremely short T<sub>2 </sub>species (e.g. 10 &#x3bc;s) through their effects on short, but detectable T<sub>2 </sub>species. Imaging of T<sub>1 </sub>in the rotating frame involves the use of RF pulses for times of the duration of T<sub>2 </sub>followed by conventional data collection. This may be achievable for short T<sub>2 </sub>species using UTE sequences without exceeding rf power limitations (at least at low B<sub>0 </sub>fields) and may be relevant for the study of the relaxation properties of large molecules with short T<sub>2</sub>'s.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Most of this application has been concerned with imaging of tissues, but UTE sequences are also useful for imaging of blood flow, since short TE's decrease dephasing effects due to flow and can help preserve signal during turbulence.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Both phosphorus and sodium have tissue components with short T<sub>2</sub>'s. These nuclei are present in lower concentration than protons but there are advantages to imaging them with UTE sequences. Radial acquisitions have been used to reduce the TE for sodium imaging to 0.3 to 0.4 ms. We have imaged sodium in tendons, ligaments and intervertebral discs using a TE of 0.07 ms and have also imaged phosphorus in cortical and trabecular bone.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref> is a transverse CUTE (TR/TE=100/0.07 ms) proton image of the lower leg, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref> is a matching phosphorus image (TR/TE=300/0.07 ms) of the same region. Phosphorus signal is seen in the cortex of the tibia in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>. The phosphorus in bone is in crystalline calcium phosphate and calcium hydroxy-appatite and has a T<sub>1 </sub>of 10 s and T<sub>2 </sub>of 0.17 ms at 1.5T. UTE CSI imaging has also been implemented for sodium and phosphorus studies of the heart.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In implementations, the above described techniques and their variations may be implemented as computer software instructions. Such instructions may be stored on one or more machine-readable storage media or devices and are executed by, e.g., one or more computer processors, or cause the machine, to perform the described functions and operations. For example, one or more controllers for an MRI system may perform functions according to computer program instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, different pulse sequences may be used for UTE imagining. Additionally, different combinations of the above features may be used. Note also that in MRI, for pulses described as being 90 degree (&#x3c0;/2) or 180 degree (&#x3c0;) pulses, the actual spin rotation angles may not be exactly 90 or 180 degrees, due to variations in physical properties.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates in general to sliders for use in magnetic storage devices, and more particularly to slider fabrication methods and slider designs that facilitate fabrication and even more particularly to lapping requirements of slider designs and methods for lapping surfaces on a slider.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A typical prior art head and disk system <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In operation the magnetic transducer <b>20</b> is supported by the suspension <b>13</b> as it flies above the disk <b>16</b>. The magnetic transducer, usually called a &#x201c;head&#x201d; or &#x201c;slider&#x201d; is composed of elements that perform the task of writing magnetic transitions (the write head <b>23</b>) and reading the magnetic transitions (the read head <b>12</b>). The electrical signals to and from the read and write heads <b>12</b>, <b>23</b> (collectively &#x201c;magnetic transducer elements&#x201d;) travel along conductive paths (leads) <b>14</b> which are attached to or embedded in the suspension <b>13</b>. Typically there are two electrical contact pads (not shown) each for the read and write heads <b>12</b>, <b>23</b>. Wires or leads <b>14</b> are connected to these pads and routed in the suspension <b>13</b> to the arm electronics (not shown). The disk <b>16</b> is attached to a spindle <b>18</b> that is driven by a spindle motor <b>24</b> to rotate the disk <b>16</b>. The disk <b>16</b> comprises a substrate <b>26</b> on which a plurality of thin films <b>21</b> are deposited. The thin films <b>21</b> include ferromagnetic material in which the write head <b>23</b> records the magnetic transitions in which information is encoded. The read head <b>12</b> reads magnetic transitions as the disk rotates under the air-bearing surface (ABS) of the magnetic transducer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a midline section of one type of prior art magnetic transducer <b>20</b> shown prior to lapping. The substrate <b>43</b> of the slider is typically a hard durable material. The components of the read head <b>12</b> shown are the first shield (S<b>1</b>), surround the sensor <b>105</b> which is surrounded by insulation layers <b>107</b>, <b>109</b> and the second shield (P<b>1</b>/S<b>2</b>). This type of magnetic transducer is called a &#x201c;merged head&#x201d; because the P<b>1</b>/S<b>2</b> layer serves as a shield for the read head <b>12</b> and a pole piece for the write head <b>23</b>. The yoke also includes a second pole piece (P<b>2</b>) which connects with P<b>1</b>/S<b>2</b> at the back The P<b>2</b> curves down over coil <b>37</b> to confront the P<b>1</b> across the write gap layer to form the write gap at the air-bearing surface (ABS). The zero throat height (ZTH) is defined as the point where the P<b>2</b> first touches the gap layer. The sensor <b>105</b> includes a magnetoresistive material such as permalloy, but may be a multilayered structure containing various layers of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic material. The shields and pole pieces are ferromagnetic materials, e.g., NiFe or CoFe. Prior to lapping the materials and structures at the ABS extend beyond the ABS. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the material to the right of the ABS plane is removed by lapping to achieve precise control of the length of the sensor <b>105</b> (which is called the &#x201c;stripe height&#x201d;) and the distance from the ZTH to the ABS (which is called the &#x201c;throat height&#x201d;). The uncertainty of the saw plane causes variations in the stripe height which are on the order of microns and which would lead to unacceptable variations in magnetic performance is not corrected. Lapping is the process used in the prior art to achieve much tighter stripe height control in the nanometer range.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the typical process of fabricating thin film magnetic transducers, a large number of transducers are formed simultaneously on a wafer. After the basic structures are formed the wafer may be sawed into quadrants, rows or individual transducers. Further processing may occur at any or all of these stages. Although sawing has been the typical method for separating the wafers into individual sliders, recently reactive ion etching (RIE) or deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) with a fluorine containing plasma has been used. The surfaces of the sliders perpendicular to the surface of the wafer that are exposed when the wafers are cut form the air bearing surface (ABS) of the slider.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">After lapping, features typically called &#x201c;rails&#x201d; are formed on the ABS of magnetic transducer <b>20</b>. The rails have traditionally been used to determine the aerodynamics of the slider and serve as the contact area should the transducer come in contact with the media either while rotating or when stationary.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,321,882 to Zarouri, et al., discloses a process for forming slider air-bearing surfaces one at a time. The sliders are supported by a mechanical backing while being processed sequentially from a column cut from the wafer. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,093,083 to Lackey, a row of sliders is processed while being rigidly bound to a carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Sliders may be lapped in rows, but it may be advantageous to have the individual sliders cut out prior to lapping. Even though the sliders have been separated, it is possible to lap several at one time by attaching them to carrier. The time required to lap sliders is a significant element in the cost of manufacturing; therefore, there is a need to improve production efficiency by reducing lapping time, and achieve an ABS surface with a greater control of flatness parameters.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A process will be described for fabricating sliders with one or more sacrificial structures (extensions) that reduce the amount of time required for lapping to create the air-bearing surface (ABS). In accordance with the present invention the amount of slider material to be removed by lapping is reduced, and additional lapping or polishing steps are eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Prior to separating individual sliders from a wafer, a mask of material that is not removable by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) is patterned on the surface of the sliders. The mask outlines a sacrificial extension around portions of the magnetic transducer elements that are nearest the predetermined plane which will become the ABS. The sacrificial extension makes the surface of the slider which will be lapped non-planar. The sacrificial extension extends below the predetermined ABS plane. When the sliders are individually separated by DRIE, the shape of the mask including the sacrificial extension is projected down into and along the slider body. The sacrificial extension covers the thin film elements of the read and write heads. The surface of the slider contains a smaller amount of material (with a high aspect ratio) to be removed by lapping relative to prior art designs which require removal of material on the entire planar surface of the slider. The sacrificial extension reduces the amount material to be removed by lapping while maintaining the ability to precisely control the magnetoresistive stripe and throat heights. In one embodiment, additional guide rails are disposed along the outer edges of the slider ABS to facilitate maintaining slider symmetry during the lapping process and prevent the slider from canting to one side. The sacrificial extension and the guide rails are partially or completely removed during the lapping process. The shape of the sacrificial extensions may be optimized for the various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the sacrificial extension is formed with a cross-sectional shape having a narrow neck which encourages breakage during the ABS lapping process, thus, further accelerating the process. In another embodiment, a channel is disposed on the side of the slider opposite the ABS to provide space for the sacrificial extension of the adjacent slider and allow the sliders to be spaced closer together on the wafer surface for more efficient use of the wafer during head fabrication.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partial view of a wafer <b>52</b> with a plurality of masks <b>53</b> for sliders according to a first embodiment of the invention. The substrate <b>43</b> is a material which is amenable to DRIE, for example, silicon. The masks <b>53</b> outline the shape of the sliders and the sacrificial extension <b>32</b> and optionally the guide rails. The mask <b>53</b> is made of a material that is resistant to DRIE, for example, photoresist or alumina. When the wafer <b>52</b> is subjected to DRIE with the ions being directed substantially perpendicular to the surface of the wafer, the individual sliders with the sacrificial extension are cut out in the shape of the mask. Although non-RIE-able material in the head structure (not shown) may also be used to define the shape of the sacrificial extension, this has the disadvantage of potentially allowing some of the head material to be sputtered off and redeposited in the kerf and thereby interfering with the clean separation of the sliders. The details of the cross-sectional shape of the sacrificial extension <b>32</b> and optional guide rails <b>34</b> are determined by the shape of the mask <b>53</b>. The shape and dimension of these features will vary according to various embodiments of the invention. The shape of the sacrificial extension need not include a planar surface and, therefore, can include curved and irregular shapes. The mask <b>53</b> in combination with DRIE allows the removal or more material between the sliders than is feasible using prior art sawing techniques. By lessening the amount of material to be removed by lapping, the technique of the invention allows the lapping process to proceed more quickly than under the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an isometric view of a slider having a sacrificial extension <b>32</b> according to the first embodiment of the invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> after the DRIE process has cut the slider from the wafer. The view of slider <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is of the trailing edge of the slider surface, i.e., the surface that is the last to pass over the moving magnetic media when in use. The guide rails <b>34</b> and the sacrificial extension <b>32</b> extend the entire length of the slider, from the trailing edge to the leading edge. The head elements <b>31</b> are illustrated as a shaded area that extends into the sacrificial extension <b>32</b>. The sacrificial extension <b>32</b> may also include the anchor base (not shown) which is used in the prior art to support the fragile pole tips during wafer fabrication. The anchor base may, in fact be part of the mask since it is typically made from a material such as NiFe which is not readily etchable in a DRIE process. The internal structure of the head elements <b>31</b> are according to the prior art and the details of these structures are independent of the invention. Thus, the invention can be used with any head structure which includes lapping as part of the fabrication process. The head elements <b>31</b> include an upper layer of material that is not subject to reactive ion etching (non-RIE-able), for example, CoFe or a NiFe alloy, and, therefore, can be used as part of the mask as well. The body of the slider <b>43</b> is a material that is removable by DRIE. Silicon is preferred as a material for the body of the slider, but other RIE-able materials can be used. The embodiment shown includes optional symmetric guide rails <b>34</b> that are disposed on the outer edges of the slider bottom surface which will be lapped. The guide rails <b>34</b> aid in the lapping process by keeping the lapped surface from canting to one side. The sliders must be held during lapping with the sacrificial extension <b>32</b> confronting the lapping plate and may be moved in relation to the lapping plate or the lapping plate may be moved. The guide rails <b>34</b> would ideally both be the same height and width, but need not be the same height or width as the sacrificial extension <b>32</b>. At some point during the lapping process the surfaces of guide rails <b>34</b> and sacrificial extension <b>32</b> will become coplanar as protruding material is worn away. The guide rails <b>34</b> are distinct from the aerodynamic rails which are used to control the flying characteristics of the slider. The guide rails <b>34</b> may be completely removed during lapping as will be noted in more detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a magnified view of the sacrificial extension <b>32</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This figure illustrates the optional planes at which the lapping process may be terminated. The M-plane is the bottom of the sacrificial extension <b>32</b> prior to lapping. In other embodiments the bottom of the sacrificial extension <b>32</b> may be shorter than the guide rails <b>34</b>. The BB-plane is one plane at which the lapping may be terminated leaving a portion of the sacrificial extension <b>32</b> and the guide rails (not shown) extending below the surrounding slider surface which is shown as plane CC. The lapping may also be continued until the DD-plane is reached at which point the sacrificial extension and the guide rails will have been completely removed, as well as, some material from the slider surface. The plane at which lapping is terminated is typically referred to as the ABS although additional material for overcoats, aerodynamic structures, etc. may be added after lapping which will result in the true, final ABS being slightly lower than the actual lapping plane.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an isometric view of a slider having a sacrificial extension <b>32</b>T according to the second embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment the sacrificial extension <b>32</b>T is structurally weak in the transverse direction because it is formed with a narrow neck (like an inverted &#x201c;T&#x201d;) which facilitates breaking to allow a significant amount of material to be removed as lapping begins and therefore tends to further reduce the lapping time. The planes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for optional points to stop lapping and thus define the ABS are the same as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a midline cross-sectional view of a slider and mask according to the invention taken perpendicular to the trailing end <b>800</b> of the slider <b>20</b> and the surface to be lapped, plane <b>802</b>. In this view, the details of the rails are not shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows that the sacrificial extension <b>32</b> extends the entire length of slider <b>20</b>. The mask <b>53</b> covers the entire surface of the slider which is overcoat <b>61</b> which has been deposited over the head elements according to the prior art. Plane <b>802</b> is indicated for reference as the bottom of the sacrificial extension <b>32</b> or an as-lapped ABS surface. The guide rails (not shown) also extend the full length of the slider parallel to the sacrificial extension <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a partial view of a wafer <b>52</b> with a plurality of masks <b>53</b>C for sliders according to a third embodiment of the invention having a channel <b>55</b> in the top surface (the surface parallel to the ABS). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an isometric view of a slider <b>20</b> according to the third embodiment of the invention. A channel <b>55</b> is sized to allow the sacrificial extension <b>32</b>T or <b>32</b> (not shown) to extend into what would otherwise be an adjacent slider. This allows the sliders to be position more densely and, therefore, more efficiently on the wafer. For this efficiency to be achieved the guide rails <b>34</b> must not extend as far as the sacrificial extension <b>32</b>T or <b>32</b>. However, multiple channels <b>55</b> may exist in adjacent sliders to accommodate other sacrificial extensions such as guide rails <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The sacrificial extensions are not necessarily placed along the central plane of the slider. The option exists for placing the magnetic transducer elements off-axis with the sacrificial extension below the sensor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the trailing edge of a slider prior to lapping according to an embodiment of the invention having the sacrificial extension and magnetic transducer elements offset from the midline of the slider. Other sacrificial extensions such as guide rails <b>34</b> may be formed at other locations on the ABS side of the slider to improve lapping uniformity and/or flatness. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, for example, the sacrificial extension <b>32</b> and guide rails <b>34</b> are symmetric about the central plane of the slider. Ideally, this will prevent the skew of the slider. In alternative embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> the offset sacrificial extension <b>32</b>T may be formed with a narrow neck which facilitates breaking as described above. As an example, an inverted &#x201c;T&#x201d; structure can be placed off the central axis of the slider with or without other sacrificial extensions to improve the rate of the lapping of the slider.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">One issue for any lapping process is determining when enough material has been removed to achieve the correct stripe height of the sensor and also the throat height of the inductive write head. Electronic lapping guides (ELG's) have been used in the prior art for this purpose. An ELG can be used with the sacrificial extension structure by including it in the guide rails, the sacrificial extension itself or any other portion of the slider which will remain after lapping. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the sensor structure could be used to determine the stripe height of the sensor and the throat height. Using the sensor has the advantage of allowing a simpler head structure, but adds the complexity of having to electrically connect the sensor structure during lapping without causing any electrical or mechanical damage to the sensor. Using the sensor as a lapping end-point detector is not exclusive to sliders with sacrificial extensions described herein, but can be used an alternative head design and lapping method to achieve a reproducible ABS plane for the slider.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Except where express materials, thickness values, etc., have been given above, the layers, structures and materials in a slider embodying the invention are according to the prior art and are fabricated according to the prior art.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Application JP 2004-255675 filed with the Japanese Patent Office on Sep. 2, 2004, the entire contents of which being incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a picture processing apparatus, a picture processing method, a picture pickup apparatus, and a program. More particularly, the invention relates to a picture processing apparatus, a picture processing method, a picture pickup apparatus, and a program for having scenes of picked-up moving pictures linked to the subjects appearing in the scenes for easy picture handling.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Falling prices of video cameras in recent years have prompted the devices to become widely available. With their enclosure getting smaller than ever, the video cameras can let people take moving pictures easily wherever they are. Moving pictures are also taken casually through the use of a moving picture pickup feature incorporated in mobile phones and digital still cameras.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although moving pictures have become easy to take, it is still difficult to handle the picked-up pictures. A number of techniques have been proposed to solve the problem through the addition of a variety of attribute information to the moving pictures having been taken. Illustratively, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2004-62868 discloses techniques whereby the names of persons appearing as subjects in picked-up pictures are recorded as meta data about the pictures.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some business-use video cameras are designed to add such attributes as the weather during picture taking, locations, sound volumes, and thumbnails representative of clips (each clip is composed of moving pictures acquired from a single picture-taking session) to each of the scenes that have been picked up.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-214945 discloses techniques for taking pictures of a person wearing a badge that emits a pattern of light indicating a particular ID which, when detected from the pictures taken, allows the person wearing the badge to be identified within the pictures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Despite the above-outlined measures to add meta data to picked-up pictures for subsequent picture handling, it is still difficult for the general user to search for particular scenes in the pictures using the diverse meta data.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the case of the DV (digital video) type video camera, for example, moving pictures recorded on a DV tape are basically reproduced only in the order in which they were taken. Users are unable to view recorded moving pictures casually.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">That is, the user generally wants to view only part of all scenes recorded on the DV tape. However, the particular scenes desired to be viewed cannot be extracted readily for reproduction apart from the rest on the tape. Besides the favorite scenes, the user is obliged to watch unnecessary scenes being reproduced chronologically, which can be a boring experience.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Where a plurality of still pictures taken by a digital still camera are captured into a personal computer or like equipment, these pictures may be displayed as thumbnails on the display to let the user select only desired scenes with ease. If specific scenes alone are selected and reproduced just as easily from moving pictures, the user will not be bored having to watch uninteresting scenes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In recent years, nonlinear editing by use of the personal computer has become commonplace. It has become popular to edit desired scenes alone through such editing processes and to write them to special media such as DVD (digital versatile disc) known for their small size and for their ease and convenience in offering immediate access to and reproduction of any of the desired pictures recorded thereon. Still, the procedures to have the personal computer capture and edit recorded moving pictures can be tortuous and complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In such cases, if it is possible to select at least specific scenes easily in reference to the persons having been picked up, the burdens of editing work are expected to be alleviated appreciably.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and provides arrangements for having the scenes of picked-up moving pictures linked to the subjects appearing in these scenes for easy picture handling.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a picture processing apparatus for processing pictures showing subjects wearing devices each assigned identification information. The picture processing apparatus includes: an acquiring mechanism acquiring a first picture sequence formed by the pictures showing the subjects wearing the devices, and a time series of the identification information assigned to the devices; and a clustering mechanism which, based on how the time series acquired by the acquiring mechanism is linked according to the identification information, links together scenes constituting the first picture sequence, the scenes having been picked up at corresponding points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the acquiring mechanism may acquire the time series of the identification information from a second picture sequence having been picked up and recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The clustering mechanism may preferably link the time series of the identification information into a single cluster in which the identification information continues over a predetermined time interval and belongs to one category.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the picture processing apparatus of the present invention may further include a reproducing mechanism reproducing, from among the scenes constituting the first picture sequence, those scenes which constitute part of the first picture sequence and which were picked up over the time interval corresponding to the single cluster.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The reproducing mechanism may reproduce the scenes which constitute the first picture sequence and which were picked up over the time intervals corresponding to a plurality of clusters formed by the time series of the identification information belonging to the same category.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the picture processing apparatus of the present invention may further include a distribution displaying mechanism displaying a time-base distribution of the scenes which constitute the first picture sequence and which were picked up over the time interval corresponding to the single cluster, the time-base distribution of the scenes being displayed in a position different from that in which the scene reproduced by the reproducing mechanism is being displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The reproducing mechanism may preferably reproduce the scene selected from the time-base distribution displayed by the distribution displaying mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The clustering mechanism may preferably link into a second cluster the time series of the identification information belonging to the same category as that of the time series of the identification information constituting the single cluster regarded as a first cluster.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the picture processing apparatus of the present invention may further include: a reproducing mechanism reproducing the first picture sequence; and a displaying mechanism which, during reproduction of a first scene constituting part of the first picture sequence picked up over the time interval corresponding to the first cluster, reproduces a second scene constituting part of the first picture sequence picked up over the time interval corresponding to the second cluster, the second scene being displayed in a position different from that in which the first scene is being displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The displaying mechanism may preferably display a plurality of the second scenes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The reproducing mechanism may preferably start reproducing the second scene displayed by the displaying mechanism when the second scene is selected by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, the picture processing apparatus of the present invention may further include a creating mechanism creating meta data representative of how the scenes constituting the first picture sequence are linked together.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a picture processing method for processing pictures showing subjects wearing devices each assigned identification information. The picture processing method includes the steps of: acquiring a picture sequence formed by the pictures showing the subjects wearing the devices, and a time series of the identification information assigned to the devices; and based on how the time series acquired in the acquiring step is linked according to the identification information, linking together scenes constituting the picture sequence, the scenes having been picked up at corresponding points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a further embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a program for causing a computer to process pictures showing subjects wearing devices each assigned identification information. The program causing the computer to execute a procedure includes the steps of: acquiring a picture sequence formed by the pictures showing the subjects wearing the devices, and a time series of the identification information assigned to the devices; and based on how the time series acquired in the acquiring step is linked according to the identification information, linking together scenes constituting the picture sequence, the scenes having been picked up at corresponding points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to an even further embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a picture pickup apparatus for processing pictures showing subjects wearing devices each assigned identification information. The picture pickup apparatus includes: a picture pickup mechanism; an acquiring mechanism acquiring a picture sequence picked up by the picture pickup mechanism and formed by the pictures showing the subjects wearing the devices, and a time series of the identification information assigned to the devices; and a clustering mechanism which, based on how the time series acquired by the acquiring mechanism is linked according to the identification information, links together scenes constituting the picture sequence, the scenes having been picked up at corresponding points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Through the use of the picture processing apparatus, picture processing method, and program according to the invention, a picture sequence formed by pictures showing subjects wearing devices each assigned identification information is acquired, together with a time series of the identification information. Based on how the acquired time series is linked according to the identification information, scenes constituting the picture sequence are linked together, the scenes having been picked up at corresponding points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Where the picture pickup apparatus of the invention is in use, a picture sequence formed by pictures showing subjects wearing devices each assigned identification information is also acquired, together with a time series of the identification information. Likewise, based on how the acquired time series is linked according to the identification information, scenes constituting the picture sequence are linked together, the scenes having been picked up at corresponding points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According the present invention, each of the scenes constituting picked-up moving pictures is handled in a manner linking the scene in question to the subjects appearing therein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the invention, when a given scene is being reproduced, other scenes showing the same subjects as those appearing in the ongoing scene may be presented to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Also according to the invention, the user may be presented consecutively with only those scenes showing a particular subject or subjects.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">An embodiment of the present invention is a picture processing apparatus (e.g., personal computer <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for processing pictures showing subjects wearing devices (e.g., sensor badges <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) each assigned identification information (ID), the picture processing apparatus comprising: an acquiring mechanism (e.g., capturing unit <b>81</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) acquiring a first picture sequence formed by the pictures (e.g., taken by a moving picture taking area <b>71</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) showing the subjects wearing the devices, and a time series of the identification information assigned to the devices; and a clustering mechanism (e.g., scene determination unit <b>82</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) which, based on how the time series acquired by the acquiring mechanism is linked according to the identification information, links together scenes constituting the first picture sequence, the scenes having been picked up at corresponding points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Preferably, the picture processing apparatus of the invention may further include a reproducing mechanism (e.g., reproduction unit <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>) reproducing, from among the scenes constituting the first picture sequence, those scenes which constitute part of the first picture sequence and which were picked up over the time interval corresponding to the single cluster.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Preferably, the picture processing apparatus of the invention may further include a distribution displaying mechanism (e.g., cluster distribution display control unit <b>103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>) displaying a time-base distribution of the scenes which constitute the first picture sequence and which were picked up over the time interval corresponding to the single cluster, the time-base distribution of the scenes being displayed in a position different from that in which the scene reproduced by the reproducing mechanism is being displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Preferably, the picture processing apparatus of the invention may further include: a reproducing mechanism (e.g., reproduction unit <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>) reproducing the first picture sequence; and a displaying mechanism (e.g., link destination display unit <b>151</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>) which, during reproduction of a first scene constituting part of the first picture sequence picked up over the time interval corresponding to the first cluster, reproduces a second scene constituting part of the first picture sequence picked up over the time interval corresponding to the second cluster, the second scene being displayed in a position different from that in which the first scene is being displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Preferably, the picture processing apparatus of the invention may further include a creating mechanism (e.g., file creation unit <b>93</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) creating meta data representative of how the scenes constituting the first picture sequence are linked together.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Another embodiment of the present invention is a picture processing method for processing pictures showing subjects wearing devices (e.g., sensor badges <b>4</b>) each assigned identification information, the picture processing method including the steps of: acquiring (e.g., in step S<b>31</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>) a picture sequence formed by the pictures (e.g., taken by the moving picture taking area <b>71</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) showing the subjects wearing the devices, and a time series of the identification information assigned to the devices; and based on how the time series acquired in the acquiring step is linked according to the identification information, linking together (e.g., in steps S<b>33</b> and S<b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>) scenes constituting the picture sequence, the scenes having been picked up at corresponding points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A further embodiment of the present invention is a program for causing a computer to execute a procedure including the same steps as those of the inventive picture processing method outlined above.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">An even further embodiment of the present invention is a picture pickup apparatus (e.g., video camera <b>301</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>) for processing pictures showing subjects wearing devices (e.g., sensor badges <b>4</b>) each assigned identification information (ID), the picture pickup apparatus including: a picture pickup mechanism (e.g., moving picture taking area <b>71</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>); an acquiring mechanism (e.g., capturing unit <b>81</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) acquiring a picture sequence picked up by the picture pickup mechanism and formed by the pictures showing the subjects wearing the devices, and a time series of the identification information assigned to the devices; and a clustering mechanism (e.g., scene determination unit <b>82</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) which, based on how the time series acquired by the acquiring mechanism is linked according to the identification information, links together scenes constituting the picture sequence, the scenes having been picked up at corresponding points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view showing a typical configuration of a picture-taking and display system to which this invention is applied. A video camera <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> offers two functions: one for picking up a picture sequence (moving pictures) to be viewed or edited by the user, and the other for detecting light-emitting patterns of sensor badges <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>4</b>-<b>3</b> worn by children <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> on their clothes in synchronism with the user's operation to start and stop a picture-taking session, the children being the subjects of the pictures.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The light-emitting patterns of the sensor badges <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>4</b>-<b>3</b> denote the ID's assigned to the children wearing them. The video camera <b>1</b> recognizes the ID's represented by the light-emitting patterns and stores the recognized ID's in conjunction with the pictures taken.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the child <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> wears the sensor badge <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> that is assigned the ID &#x201c;<b>0</b>,&#x201d; the child <b>3</b>-<b>2</b> wears the sensor badge <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> with the ID &#x201c;<b>1</b>,&#x201d; and the child <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> wears the sensor badge <b>4</b>-<b>3</b> with the ID &#x201c;<b>2</b>.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">If the user takes pictures of the child <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> as the subject, the picked-up pictures are stored in conjunction with the ID &#x201c;<b>0</b>.&#x201d; If the children <b>3</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> are found appearing in the same pickup range of the video camera <b>1</b> covering the child <b>3</b>-<b>1</b>, the picked-up pictures are stored in association with the ID's &#x201c;<b>0</b>,&#x201d; &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>2</b>.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The pictures taken by the video camera <b>1</b> and the ID's recognized thereby are captured into a personal computer <b>2</b> in wired or wireless fashion as indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In keeping with meta data derived from the ID's, the personal computer <b>2</b> reproduces or edits the pictures taken by the video camera <b>1</b>. In the description that follows, the children <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> will be generically referred to as the child or children <b>3</b> and the sensor badges <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>4</b>-<b>3</b> as the sensor badge or badges <b>4</b> if there is no specific need for distinction therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view showing how pictures are handled illustratively by the personal computer <b>2</b>. In keeping with the ID's stored in conjunction with the pictures, the personal computer <b>2</b> recognizes the subject (child <b>3</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in each of the scenes formed by the pictures, and reproduces the pictures in scenes each showing the subject designated by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the picked-up pictures are clustered into three scenes: a scene in which &#x201c;my child&#x201d; alone appears (e.g., child <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> of the user operating the personal computer <b>2</b>), a scene in which &#x201c;my child&#x201d; and &#x201c;someone else's child&#x201d; (e.g., children <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>2</b>) appear, and a scene in which only &#x201c;someone else's children&#x201d; appear.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Suppose that with the pictures clustered as outlined above, the user designates reproduction of the scene showing &#x201c;my child.&#x201d; In that case, the scene from a time t<sub>1 </sub>until a time t<sub>2 </sub>in which the child <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> appears is reproduced out of the entire picked-up pictures on the basis of meta data representing the result of the clustering process.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this context, the expression &#x201c;scene&#x201d; means a sequence of a predetermined number of successive pictures out of all pictures taken and arranged chronologically. The user may view only the desired scenes in which the user's child appears. This is a much less boring experience than if the entire pictures taken must be viewed in order of time.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Naturally, the subjects are not limited to three children. The subjects may be adults, animals, or any other physical objects. The ID's need not be represented solely by the badges worn by the subjects. As long as they emit appropriate ID patterns, any other suitable devices may be carried by the subject's hand or hung around the subject's neck.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Described below with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is what the user does to reproduce scenes in which a particular subject appears. In step S<b>1</b>, the user sets the personal computer <b>2</b> to recognize which ID's assigned to the sensor badges <b>4</b> correspond to whom. For example, the user sets the personal computer <b>2</b> to associate the ID &#x201c;<b>0</b>&#x201d; with &#x201c;my child (child A),&#x201d; the ID &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d; with a child B, and the ID &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d; with a child C.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In step S<b>2</b>, the user operates the video camera <b>1</b> to take pictures of the children <b>3</b> wearing the sensor badges <b>4</b>. In this step, the ID's of the children <b>3</b> are stored in conjunction with the picked-up pictures.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In step S<b>3</b>, the user connects the video camera <b>1</b> with the personal computer <b>2</b> in wired or wireless fashion so as to let the personal computer <b>2</b> capture the stored pictures and ID's from the video camera <b>1</b>. In turn, the personal computer <b>2</b> groups the pictures captured from the video camera <b>1</b> into clusters in a suitably timed manner.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In step S<b>4</b>, the user designates an appropriate category and starts reproduction of a scene or scenes (i.e., group of pictures showing the same child) belonging to that category. How the video camera <b>1</b> and personal computer <b>2</b> work in response to the user's operations outlined above will be discussed later in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view showing a typical structure of the sensor badge <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The sensor badges <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>3</b> also have the same structure.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The sensor badge <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> is made up of a microcomputer <b>11</b> and an LED (light-emitting diode) <b>12</b>. The microcomputer <b>11</b> controls the LED <b>12</b> so that the latter emits a pattern representative of, say, the ID &#x201c;<b>0</b>.&#x201d; Under control of the microcomputer <b>11</b>, the LED <b>12</b> emits the pattern of light at a fixed frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram showing a typical structure of the microcomputer <b>11</b>. An ID storage unit <b>21</b> stores the ID assigned to the microcomputer <b>11</b>. A light emission control unit <b>22</b> reads the ID from the ID storage unit <b>21</b> and causes the LED <b>12</b> to emit the pattern of light representing the retrieved ID.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The ID assigned to the sensor badge <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> is indicated illustratively on its surface. Taking a look at the badge surfaces allows the user to identify the children. The user may rewrite the ID in the sensor badge <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> as needed by getting the personal computer <b>2</b> to connect with the sensor badge <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> using a cable.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram showing a typical structure of the personal computer <b>2</b> included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A CPU (central processing unit) <b>31</b> performs various processes in keeping with programs held in a ROM (read only memory) <b>32</b> or with programs loaded into a RAM (random access memory) <b>33</b> from a storage unit <b>38</b>. The RAM <b>33</b> also accommodates data that may be needed by the CPU <b>31</b> in carrying out its diverse processes.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The CPU <b>31</b>, ROM <b>32</b>, and RAM <b>33</b> are interconnected via a bus <b>34</b>. An input/output interface <b>35</b> is also connected to the bus <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The input/output interface <b>35</b> is connected to an input unit <b>36</b> made of a keyboard and a mouse, to a display unit <b>37</b> composed of an LCD (liquid crystal display) or the like, to the storage unit <b>38</b> such as a hard disk drive, and to a communication unit <b>39</b> that conducts wired or wireless communications with the video camera <b>1</b>. The storage unit <b>38</b> holds illustratively the pictures and ID's captured from the video camera <b>1</b> via the communication unit <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A drive <b>40</b> is connected as needed to the input/output interface <b>35</b>. Removable media <b>41</b> such as a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a magneto-optical disk, or a semiconductor memory may be loaded into the drive <b>40</b>. Computer programs retrieved from the loaded removable medium are installed as needed into the storage unit <b>38</b>. If the video camera <b>1</b> is designed to store acquired pictures onto the removable medium such as the optical disk or flash memory, then the pictures and ID's picked up by the video camera <b>1</b> may be carried by the medium before being placed into the personal computer <b>2</b> through the drive <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram showing a typical functional structure of the personal computer <b>2</b>. At least part of the functional blocks in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be implemented by the CPU <b>31</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> executing suitable programs.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">A setting unit <b>51</b> is provided to accept the settings of ID's and corresponding names entered by the user through the input unit <b>36</b>. The accepted ID's and names are forwarded from the setting unit <b>51</b> to an ID/name storage unit <b>52</b> for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The ID/name storage unit <b>51</b> retains the ID's and corresponding names. This allow the personal computer <b>2</b> to identify the persons (i.e., their names) appearing in each of the scenes based on the association between the stored ID's and the pictures captured from the video camera <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">A name-setting process of the personal computer <b>2</b> is described below with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. This process is carried out in response to the user's operation in step S<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In step S<b>11</b>, the setting unit <b>51</b> accepts the ID's and corresponding names set by the user through the input unit <b>36</b>. In step S<b>12</b>, the accepted ID's and names are forwarded from the setting unit <b>51</b> to the ID/name storage unit <b>52</b> for storage. On the basis of the ID's and corresponding names thus stored, the personal computer <b>2</b> links scenes into clusters by the persons appearing therein. This and other processes of the personal computer <b>2</b> will be discussed later in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic view showing a typical structure of the video camera <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. An imaging device <b>62</b> is constituted by a CCD (charge coupled device) and CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor). The pickup area of the device is made up of a moving picture taking area <b>71</b> and a recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The moving picture taking area <b>71</b> takes pictures illustratively at a frame rate of 30 frames per second, and outputs to a DSP (digital signal processor) <b>63</b> signals (i.e., picked-up pictures) reflecting the light received through a lens <b>61</b>. The recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b> takes pictures at a faster frame rate than the moving picture taking area <b>71</b> and outputs acquired luminance signals to the DSP <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The picture-taking process of the moving picture taking area <b>71</b> and that of the recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b> are carried out in synchronism with the user's operations to start and stop a picture-taking session. The pickup area of the moving picture taking area <b>71</b> is substantially the same as that of the recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b>. It follows that the child whose ID is recognized in the pictures taken by the recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b> also appears in the pictures taken at the same time by the moving picture taking area <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The DSP <b>63</b> recognizes ID's in the pictures coming from the recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b>. Illustratively, the DSP <b>63</b> recognizes the light-emitting patterns (i.e., ID's) of the sensor badges <b>4</b> by chronologically comparing luminance changes in the pictures taken by the recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b>. The DSP <b>63</b> recognizes each ID at intervals of, say, one second. Furthermore, the DSP <b>63</b> stores into the storage unit <b>64</b> the pictures supplied from the moving picture taking area <b>71</b>, in conjunction with the recognized ID's. Techniques for recognizing ID's from picked-up pictures are illustratively disclosed in detail by Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-214945.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The storage unit <b>64</b> is typically constituted by a storage medium such as a hard disk, DVD (digital versatile disk), a flash memory or a magnetic tape, and by a drive that drives the medium that is loaded therein.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The communication unit <b>65</b> performs wired communications with the personal computer <b>2</b> through an IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 1394 cable or a USB (Universal Serial Bus) cable, and carries out wireless communications with the computer <b>2</b> in accordance with IEEE 802.11a/b/g or like standards. The communications allow the pictures and ID's retrieved from the storage <b>64</b> to be output to the personal computer <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Described below with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a picture-taking process of the video camera <b>1</b>. This process is carried out in response to the user's operation in step S<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">When the user gives an instruction to start the picture-taking process, step S<b>21</b> is reached. In step S<b>21</b>, the imaging device <b>62</b> causes the moving picture taking area <b>71</b> and recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b> to start taking pictures. The pictures taken by the moving picture taking area <b>71</b> and those taken by the recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b> are output to the DSP <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In step S<b>22</b>, the DSP <b>63</b> recognizes ID's repeatedly at predetermined intervals from the pictures sent by the recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b> of the imaging device <b>62</b>. In step S<b>23</b>, the DSP <b>63</b> stores the pictures coming from the moving picture taking area <b>71</b> into the storage unit <b>64</b>, in conjunction with the recognized ID's.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In step S<b>24</b>, a check is made to determine whether the user has given an instruction to end the picture-taking process. Step S<b>21</b> and the subsequent steps are repeated until the user's instruction to end the picture-taking process is detected. When the instruction to end the picture-taking process is detected, the picture-taking process is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">When the steps above are repeated in response to the user's operations, the storage unit <b>64</b> stores the pictures in which diverse combinations of the children wearing the sensor badges <b>4</b> appear, such as pictures in which only the child <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> appears, pictures in which the children <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>2</b> appear together, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a tabular view showing an example of how ID's are recognized. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows how the ID's &#x201c;<b>0</b>,&#x201d; &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d; (representing the children <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> respectively) are either recognized or not recognized in each of time intervals (recognition times) following a start of the picture-taking process.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the ID &#x201c;<b>0</b>&#x201d; and ID &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d; are recognized and the ID &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d; is not recognized in a recognition time &#x201c;Time <b>0</b>,&#x201d; one second after the start of the process. That means the pictures taken by the moving picture taking area <b>71</b> during the recognition time &#x201c;Time <b>0</b>&#x201d; have the children <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> appearing therein.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Likewise, the ID &#x201c;<b>0</b>&#x201d; and ID &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d; are recognized and the ID &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d; is not recognized in a recognition time &#x201c;Time <b>1</b>.&#x201d; That is, the pictures taken by the moving picture taking area <b>71</b> during the recognition time &#x201c;Time <b>1</b>&#x201d; have the children <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>2</b> appearing therein.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Data that is representative of such results of ID recognition during the different time intervals is stored into the storage unit <b>64</b> by the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.

<p id="p-0138" num="0137">A capturing unit <b>81</b> communicates with the video camera <b>1</b> through the communication unit <b>39</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) so as to capture picked-up pictures and raw ID data from the video camera <b>1</b>. The capturing unit <b>81</b> outputs the captured raw ID data to a scene determination unit <b>82</b> and the captured pictures to a reproduction control unit <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Based on the raw ID data coming from the capturing unit <b>81</b>, the scene determination unit <b>82</b> links scenes of the pictures into clusters, and outputs a meta data file describing the results of the clustering process to the reproduction control unit <b>83</b>. The meta data file output by the scene determination unit <b>82</b> includes information about how the pictures sent from the capturing unit <b>81</b> to the reproduction control unit <b>83</b> are grouped into categories, and information about how the pictures are linked together.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The reproduction control unit <b>83</b> reproduces the pictures fed from the capturing unit <b>81</b> in accordance with the description of the meta data file supplied by the scene determination unit <b>82</b>. The player screen displayed by the reproduction control unit <b>83</b> on the display unit <b>37</b> displays only the pictures of the user-selected category, as will be discussed later. Apart from the currently reproduced picture, the pictures linked to that picture are arranged to appear on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As described, the personal computer <b>2</b> reproduces picked-up pictures based on the result of the clustering process which in turn was carried out using the outcome of the ID recognizing process.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a schematic view showing how an ID recognition time is related to picked-up pictures. Suppose that pictures were taken by the NTSC (National Television System Committee) system, that the picture-taking process and ID recognizing process were started simultaneously, and that a single ID recognition time is one second. In such a case, a scene of 30 frames (pictures) was taken during a recognition time T as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The scene determination unit <b>82</b> links recognition times into clusters in accordance with the results of ID recognition such as those represented by the raw ID data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Since the range in which to pick up pictures for ID recognition purposes is substantially the same as the range in which to take pictures for reproduction (i.e., pictures in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), the act of linking the recognition times into clusters using the outcome of the ID recognizing process is equivalent to linking into clusters the pictures taken during the same recognition times, the pictures being clustered according to the subject appearing therein.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">As described above, to reproduce moving pictures based on the ID recognition times linked into clusters signifies reproducing the moving pictures as they have been linked into clusters according to the subject appearing therein. The personal computer <b>2</b> reproduces moving pictures in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a block diagram showing a typical structure of the scene determination unit <b>82</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the unit linking picked-up pictures into clusters by resorting to the recognition times linked into clusters. The scene determination unit <b>82</b> is made up of a filtering unit <b>91</b>, a clustering unit <b>92</b>, and a file creation unit <b>93</b>. The filtering unit <b>91</b> will be described first.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the filtering unit <b>91</b> carries out two processes. One process is a process for removing as a noise a given subject that comes into view momentarily, i.e., where a corresponding ID is recognized only momentarily according to the raw ID data supplied from the capturing unit <b>81</b>. The other process is a process for filling a gap in which a given subject has dropped out instantaneously from view, i.e., where a corresponding ID is not recognized instantaneously in accordance with the raw ID data.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Each of the blocks arranged chronologically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> represents a single ID recognition time. A shaded block means that an ID is recognized during the corresponding recognition time, and a blank block signifies that no ID is recognized in the corresponding recognition time. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> gives a chronological description of how ID's are either recognized or not recognized over time as illustrated by the raw ID data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a schematic view showing another example of filtering by the filtering unit <b>91</b> when ID's are not recognized momentarily (e.g., one ID during one recognition time each), the unit acting to fill the gaps formed by the dropped-out ID's.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows whether a given ID is recognized or not recognized in each of recognition times T<sub>0 </sub>through T<sub>14</sub>.

The ID's are not recognized during the remaining recognition times T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>6 </sub>through T<sub>9</sub>, and T<sub>11</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Where the results of such ID recognition are supplied from the capturing unit <b>81</b>, it might happen that an ID is recognized in one recognition time preceding the recognition time of interest.

<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Illustratively, suppose that the recognition time T<sub>3 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is the recognition time of interest.

<p id="p-0152" num="0151">If the recognition time T<sub>6 </sub>is assumed to be the recognition time of interest, then the filtering unit <b>91</b> assumes that the ID is recognized in that recognition time T<sub>6 </sub>because the ID is recognized in the immediately preceding recognition time T<sub>5</sub>, as shown in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Likewise, if the recognition time T<sub>11 </sub>is assumed to be the recognition time of interest, the filtering unit <b>91</b> assumes that the ID is recognized in that recognition time T<sub>11 </sub>because the ID is recognized in the immediately preceding recognition time T<sub>10</sub>, as shown in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> also shows whether a given ID is recognized or not recognized in each of recognition times T<sub>0 </sub>through T<sub>14</sub>.

The ID's are not recognized during the remaining recognition times T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>6 </sub>through T<sub>9</sub>, and T<sub>11</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Where the results of such ID recognition are supplied from the capturing unit <b>81</b>, it might happen that the ID is not recognized in one recognition time following the recognition time of interest.

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Illustratively, suppose that the recognition time T<sub>2 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is the recognition time of interest.

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">If the recognition time T<sub>5 </sub>is assumed to be the recognition time of interest, then the filtering unit <b>91</b> assumes that the ID is not recognized in that recognition time T<sub>5 </sub>because the ID is not recognized in the immediately following recognition time T<sub>6</sub>, as shown in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In the description that follows, the process of filing a momentarily dropped-out ID as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> will be called the &#x201c;fattening&#x201d; process, and the process of removing a momentarily recognized ID as a noise, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, will be called the &#x201c;slimming&#x201d; process.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, it is assumed that the time interval to be filled to compensate for a dropped-out ID and the time interval to be removed as a noise formed by a dropped-in ID constitute one recognition time each. However, this is not limitative of the invention. Alternatively, if an ID is not recognized for two consecutive recognition times, these recognition times might be filled with the ID collectively depending on what is recognized or not recognized before and after the ID-free two recognition times; if an ID is recognized for two consecutive recognition times, these recognition times might be removed collectively as a noise depending on what is recognized or not recognized before and after the ID-filled two recognition times.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a schematic view showing an even further example of filtering by the filtering unit <b>91</b>.

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">When the above-described processes are carried out, the gap constituted by the recognition time T<sub>11 </sub>is filled; the recognition time T<sub>11 </sub>is a time interval in which the ID was not recognized prior to the processing by the filtering unit <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a schematic view showing a still further example of filtering by the filtering unit <b>91</b>. The filtering unit <b>91</b> performs the fattening and sliming processes a predetermined number of times each, in that order, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. This provides the time series indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The filtering unit <b>91</b> then carries out the slimming process and fattening process a predetermined number of times each, in that order, on that time series, thereby acquiring a time series indicated by a hollow downward arrow A<sub>2 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. As a result, the noises represented by the recognition times T<sub>5 </sub>and T<sub>10 </sub>are removed, each of the recognition times T<sub>5 </sub>and T<sub>10 </sub>being preceded and followed by blocks in which no ID is recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">As described, the filtering unit <b>91</b> performs the fattening and slimming processes a predetermined number of times each in an appropriate order regarding each of the ID's included in the supplied raw ID data, whereby the raw ID data is suitably processed.

In the description that follows, the processed data forwarded from the filtering unit <b>91</b> to the clustering unit <b>92</b> will be referred to as the processed ID data.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The clustering unit <b>92</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> will now be described. The clustering unit <b>92</b> links ID recognition times (i.e., scenes of corresponding times) into clusters based on the processed ID data coming from the filtering unit <b>91</b>. The clustering process divides the scenes into predetermined categories whose meanings are defined illustratively by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a tabular view showing typical meanings of categories <b>0</b> through <b>3</b> established by the user. The category <b>1</b> is a category of the scenes in which only &#x201c;my child&#x201d; appears (e.g., child A in the foregoing examples).

<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The category <b>1</b> is a category of the scenes in which &#x201c;my child&#x201d; and &#x201c;someone else's child&#x201d; appear (e.g., scenes in which the children A and B appear). The category <b>1</b> is next to the category <b>0</b> in importance.</p>

<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The category <b>3</b> is a category of the scenes in which no one appears. This category is established as a category for meaningless scenes.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The clustering unit <b>92</b> performs its clustering process in such a manner that the scenes involved are grouped into each of the established categories having their appropriately assigned meanings.</p>

At the end of the clustering process on the category <b>0</b>, another clustering process (in step S<b>42</b>) is carried out on the category <b>1</b> that is next to the category <b>0</b> in importance.

<p id="p-0174" num="0173">For example, since any scene in which only &#x201c;my child&#x201d; appears is the most important, the clustering unit <b>92</b> finds the category <b>0</b> applicable to any window including at least one recognition time in which the ID of &#x201c;my child&#x201d; is recognized.</p>

The clustering process on the category <b>1</b>, as will be discussed later, focuses on the time series of the ID's not only of &#x201c;my child&#x201d; but also of &#x201c;someone else's child.&#x201d; The windows including the recognition times in which the ID's of not only &#x201c;my child&#x201d; but also &#x201c;someone else's child&#x201d; are recognized are then deemed to fall into the category <b>1</b>.

The clustering unit <b>92</b> outputs to the file creation unit <b>93</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) the results of its clustering, i.e., information about the categories and clusters of the windows processed.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In the manner described above, the recognition times involved (i.e., scenes picked up during corresponding time intervals) are linked into clusters on the basis of the results of ID recognition, and picked-up pictures are reproduced in such clusters. For example, by selecting the category <b>0</b> for clusters to be reproduced, the user can watch consecutively the scenes in which only &#x201c;my child&#x201d; appears. When selecting the category <b>0</b>, the user can watch successively the scenes in which &#x201c;my child&#x201d; and &#x201c;someone else's child&#x201d; appear.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Conversely, by not selecting the category <b>2</b>, the user can avoid watching the scenes in which &#x201c;someone else's child&#x201d; appears in more than half the time. When not selecting the category <b>3</b>, the user can avoid viewing the scenes in which no one appears or only the children not wearing the sensor badges <b>4</b> appear.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The file creation unit <b>93</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> will now be described. The file creation unit <b>93</b> links clusters together based on the results of clustering by the clustering unit <b>92</b>, in order to create a meta data file that describes the results of such linking and clustering processes. The meta data file thus created by the file creation unit <b>93</b> is output to the reproduction control unit <b>83</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a schematic view showing an example of information described in the meta data file (i.e., information about which scenes belong to which categories). The time series of windows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is the same as the time series resulting from the last clustering process, indicated by the hollow arrow A<sub>3 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. When the windows are clustered by the clustering unit <b>92</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the meta data file describes information indicating the beginning of each cluster (e.g., frame number) and the category applicable to that cluster. For example, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the meta data file may describe the first frame number and the applicable category <b>0</b> for a cluster M<sub>0</sub>, the first frame number and the applicable category <b>1</b> for a cluster M<sub>1</sub>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a schematic view showing another example of information described in the meta data file (e.g., information about scenes each belonging to the same category as that of some other scenes). The time series of windows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is also the same as the time series resulting from the last clustering process, indicated by the hollow arrow A<sub>3 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. When the windows are clustered by the clustering unit <b>92</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the meta data file describes information indicating the beginning of each cluster (e.g., frame number) and the beginning of any other cluster belonging to the same category as that of the cluster in question. For example, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the meta data file may describe the first frame number of the cluster <b>0</b> together with the first frame numbers of clusters M<sub>2 </sub>and M<sub>4 </sub>which belong to the same category as that of the cluster <b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Based on the information about the clusters falling into the same category, the file creation unit <b>93</b> links appropriate clusters together. Information about the clusters thus linked is also described in the meta data file.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Illustratively, one cluster of interest is linked to other clusters in the same category provided the latter clusters are longer (in time) than the cluster of interest. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, suppose that a cluster M<sub>2 </sub>is the cluster of interest and is in the same category as clusters M<sub>0</sub>, M<sub>1</sub>, and M<sub>3 </sub>through M<sub>5</sub>. In this case, the file creation unit <b>93</b> links the cluster M<sub>2 </sub>to the clusters M<sub>0</sub>, M<sub>4 </sub>and M<sub>5 </sub>which are longer than the cluster M<sub>2</sub>. The first frame number in each of the linked clusters M<sub>0</sub>, M<sub>4 </sub>and M<sub>5 </sub>is written to the meta data file so as to reflect the result of the linking process. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the cluster M<sub>4 </sub>is the longest cluster followed by the clusters M<sub>0 </sub>and M<sub>5</sub>, in that order.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">When a scene of a given cluster is being reproduced, linking-related information is used illustratively as a basis for displaying other scenes linked to the currently reproduced scene. Where the clusters M<sub>0</sub>, M<sub>4 </sub>and M<sub>5 </sub>are linked to the cluster M<sub>2 </sub>as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the scene of the cluster M<sub>2 </sub>currently reproduced and displayed on the screen is accompanied by the scenes which, derived from the clusters M<sub>0</sub>, M<sub>4 </sub>and M<sub>5</sub>, are displayed concurrently on the same screen. Specific screen displays will be discussed later.</p>

<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Line <b>6</b> describes the audio involved. Line <b>6</b>, &#x201c;filename=sample.wav&#x201d; denotes the file name for the audio.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref> describe illustratively some of the clusters explained above. Line <b>1</b>, &#x201c;ClusterDepthNum=<b>3</b>&#x201d; under the heading &#x201c;Cluster Info&#x201d; indicates that there are three degrees of cluster granularity in the cluster data description.

<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Cluster granularity corresponds illustratively to the above-mentioned minimum number of windows that make up a single cluster (e.g., four windows in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). Where the same video is to be reproduced, the degree of cluster granularity becomes coarser the larger the minimum window count leading to fewer clusters to be created, with each cluster getting bigger. Conversely, the degree of cluster granularity becomes finer the smaller the number of minimum window count resulting in more clusters to be created, with each cluster getting smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The user may select &#x201c;coarse,&#x201d; &#x201c;medium&#x201d; or &#x201c;fine&#x201d; cluster granularity in order to grasp visually a broad outline of the pictures taken or to watch details of the picked-up pictures.

<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Described below is what the personal computer <b>2</b> does to create a meta data file of the above-explained type. First, overall processing of the personal computer <b>2</b> is outlined with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">A meta data file is created by the personal computer <b>2</b> roughly in four processes: capturing by the capturing unit <b>81</b> (in step S<b>31</b>), filtering by the filtering unit <b>91</b> of the scene determination unit <b>82</b> (in step S<b>32</b>), clustering by the clustering unit <b>92</b> (in steps S<b>33</b> and S<b>34</b>), and creation of the file by the file creation unit <b>93</b> (in step S<b>35</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">In step S<b>31</b>, the capturing unit <b>81</b> captures picked-up pictures and raw ID data. The captured raw ID data is output to the scene determination unit <b>82</b>, and the captured pictures are forwarded to the reproduction control unit <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">In step S<b>32</b>, the filtering unit <b>91</b> removes as noises the pictures in which a given subject appears only momentarily in view of the raw ID data sent from the capturing unit <b>81</b>. The filtering unit <b>91</b> also serves to fill gaps formed by the pictures in which the subject of interest disappears momentarily. The filtering unit <b>91</b> thus provides processed ID data and outputs the data to the clustering unit <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">In step S<b>33</b>, in accordance with the processed ID data coming from the filtering unit <b>91</b>, the clustering unit <b>92</b> determines the principally recognized ID or ID's in each of the windows involved in order to categorize the windows.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">In step S<b>34</b>, based on the result from step S<b>33</b>, the clustering unit <b>92</b> checks to determine whether a predetermined number of windows in the same category are continued. If a group of continuously occurring windows is detected, the windows are linked into a cluster. As mentioned above, the minimum number of windows constituting each cluster is defined by the degree of granularity in effect. The result of the clustering process by the clustering unit <b>92</b> is output to the file creation unit <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">In step S<b>35</b>, the file creation unit <b>93</b> links scenes together based on the outcome of the clustering by the clustering unit <b>92</b>, thus creating a meta data file that describes the results of the linking and clustering processes.

<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The processing of the scene determination unit <b>82</b> will now be described in more detail with reference to the flowcharts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 through 38</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">In step S<b>51</b>, the filtering unit <b>91</b> acquires the raw ID data sent from the capturing unit <b>81</b>. In step S<b>52</b>, the filtering unit <b>91</b> obtains all ID's recorded in the raw ID data. For example, if pictures of the children <b>3</b> wearing the sensor badges <b>4</b> that are assigned the ID's &#x201c;<b>0</b>,&#x201d; &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d; are captured into the personal computer <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, then the three ID's &#x201c;<b>0</b>,&#x201d; &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d; are searched for and acquired. The number of ID's thus acquired is established as the value MAXID.</p>

Cluster selection areas <b>132</b> and <b>133</b> are operated to designate the clusters to be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">The clusters to be reproduced may be selected alternatively from the screen such as one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. The screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> displays four selection buttons: a category selection button <b>141</b> bearing the expression &#x201c;Child A alone,&#x201d; a category selection button <b>142</b> with the expression &#x201c;Child A and someone else's child,&#x201d; a category selection button <b>143</b> with the expression &#x201c;Only someone else's children,&#x201d; and a category selection button <b>144</b> with the expression &#x201c;Nobody there/children not wearing badges.&#x201d; The expressions displayed on the buttons reflect the user-established settings (i.e., correspondence with ID's).</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">Illustratively, if the category selection button <b>141</b> is clicked on, the clusters belonging to the category <b>0</b> representative of the pictures in which &#x201c;child A&#x201d; alone appears are reproduced.

<p id="p-0312" num="0311">If the category selection button <b>142</b> is clicked on, the clusters belonging to the category <b>1</b> representative of the pictures in which &#x201c;child A&#x201d; and &#x201c;someone else's child (children B and C in this case) appear are reproduced. At this point, the cluster distribution display area <b>115</b> displays the distribution of the clusters falling into the category <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">Likewise, if the category selection button <b>143</b> is clicked on, the cluster distribution display area <b>115</b> displays the distribution of the clusters in the category <b>2</b>, and the clusters of the category <b>2</b> representing the pictures in which &#x201c;someone else's children&#x201d; alone appear are reproduced. If the category selection button <b>144</b> is clicked on, the cluster distribution display area <b>115</b> displays the distribution of the clusters in the category <b>3</b>, and reproduction is made of the clusters of the category <b>3</b> representing the pictures in which nobody appears or people not wearing the sensor badges <b>4</b> appear (i.e., children A, B and C wearing the badges <b>4</b> do not appear).</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">With the help of the screen displayed as described above, the user is able to select in an intuitive manner the desired clusters to be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">Described below with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> is a reproducing process performed by the reproduction control unit <b>83</b> to reproduce moving pictures on the screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">In step S<b>111</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> reads the meta data file sent from the scene determination unit <b>82</b>. In step S<b>112</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> accepts &#x201c;ClusterDepth&#x201d; (i.e., degree of granularity) designated by the user. For example, where the screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> is in effect with nothing displayed in the moving picture display area <b>111</b> and cluster distribution display area <b>115</b>, the user is prompted to specify &#x201c;ClusterDepth&#x201d; in the granularity selection area <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">In step S<b>113</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> checks to determine whether the &#x201c;ClusterDepth&#x201d; setting designated by the user is compatible with the corresponding description in the meta data file. If the user-designated &#x201c;ClusterDepth&#x201d; is not found compatible with the file description, step S<b>112</b> is reached again and the subsequent steps are repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">Illustratively, it might happen that the user designates a degree of granularity other than the &#x201c;coarse,&#x201d; &#x201c;medium&#x201d; and &#x201c;fine&#x201d; degrees of granularity described in the meta data file. In that case, the user-designated granularity is deemed incompatible with the description in the meta data file.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">If in step S<b>113</b> the control unit <b>101</b> determines that the user-designated &#x201c;ClusterDepth&#x201d; is compatible with the meta data file description, step S<b>114</b> is reached. In step S<b>114</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> accepts designation of a cluster number or numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">In step S<b>115</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> checks to determine whether the cluster numbers designated by the user are compatible with the corresponding description in the meta data file. If the user-designated cluster numbers are not found compatible with the meta data file description, step S<b>114</b> is reached again and the subsequent steps are repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">For example, it might happen that the user designates cluster numbers other than the clusters <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> (i.e., categories <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>). In that case, the user-designated cluster numbers are deemed incompatible with the description in the meta data file.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">If in step S<b>115</b> the user-designated cluster numbers are found compatible with the meta data file description, the control unit <b>101</b> goes to step S<b>116</b>. In step S<b>116</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> creates links to the clusters having the designated cluster numbers, by checking what is designated by the user in the &#x201c;ClusterDepth&#x201d; description.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">For example, suppose that the &#x201c;ClusterData&#x201d; description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is in effect and that the &#x201c;ClusterDepth<b>0</b>&#x201d; setting and the cluster number <b>1</b> are designated by the user. In that case, what is described on lines <b>1</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>14</b> regarding &#x201c;ClusterDepth<b>0</b>&#x201d; is referenced. If there exist clusters with their frame numbers something other than <b>0</b> through <b>442</b> (i.e., clusters defined by the descriptions on lines <b>1</b> and <b>4</b>), these clusters are linked together. Information about the clusters linked by the control unit <b>101</b> is supplied from the control unit <b>101</b> to the cluster distribution display control unit <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">In step S<b>117</b>, given the information from the control unit <b>101</b>, the cluster distribution display control unit <b>103</b> causes the cluster distribution display area <b>115</b> to display accordingly a chronological distribution of the clusters having the user-designated cluster numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">In step S<b>118</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> sets the value 0 to a cluster index representative of the cluster to be reproduced. The cluster index 0 illustratively denotes the leftmost cluster among the clusters displayed in the cluster distribution display area <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">In step S<b>119</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> causes the cluster distribution display control unit <b>103</b> to emphasize the color (e.g., red) of the clusters which are subject to reproduction and which appear in the cluster distribution display area <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">In step S<b>120</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> supplies the reproduction unit <b>102</b> with the pictures that belong to the cluster corresponding to the cluster index 0 for reproduction. The supplied cluster is selected from the pictures taken.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">When reproduction of the last frame in the currently reproduced cluster is finished, the control unit <b>101</b> goes to step S<b>121</b>. In step S<b>121</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> increments the cluster index value by one. In step S<b>122</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> checks to determine whether reproduction of the last frame in the last cluster is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">If in step S<b>122</b> the control unit <b>101</b> determines that reproduction of the last frame in the last cluster is not finished yet, the control unit <b>101</b> returns to step S<b>119</b> to repeat it and the subsequent steps. If in step S<b>122</b> reproduction of the last frame in the last cluster is found completed, the control unit <b>101</b> terminates the reproducing process.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">In the manner described above, the user is able to watch the pictures of the designated category in appropriate clusters.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">The foregoing explanation has focused primarily on how pictures are reproduced in keeping with the cluster-related descriptions (the &#x201c;ClusterData&#x201d; description in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>) in the meta data file shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 through 32</figref>. What follows is an explanation about a linking process, in particular about the structure and the workings of the reproduction control unit <b>83</b> that reproduces picked-up pictures based on the &#x201c;LinkData&#x201d; description in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> is a block diagram showing another typical functional structure of the reproduction control unit <b>83</b>. Of the reference numerals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, those already used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> designate like or corresponding parts.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">The control unit <b>101</b> acquires pictures sent from the capturing unit <b>81</b>, and acquires the necessary pictures from among the acquired pictures based on the link-related descriptions in the meta data file coming from the scene determination unit <b>82</b> and in response to the user's operations. The control unit <b>101</b> outputs the picture to be reproduced to the reproduction unit <b>102</b>. From the pictures supplied from the capturing unit <b>81</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> also selects link destination pictures, i.e., pictures to which is linked the picture currently reproduced by the reproduction unit <b>102</b>, and outputs the selected link destination pictures to the link destination display unit <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">For example, where the meta data file including the &#x201c;LinkData&#x201d; description in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is provided and where the picture with the frame number <b>0</b> is being reproduced by the reproduction unit <b>102</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> selects the pictures having the frame numbers <b>2452</b>, <b>5564</b>, and <b>343</b> as the link destinations of the currently reproduced picture (from the file named &#x201c;family.mpg&#x201d;), and outputs the selected pictures to the link destination display unit <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">The reproduction unit <b>102</b> reproduces the picture sent from the control unit <b>101</b>. The reproduced picture is displayed in a predetermined position on the display unit <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">The link destination display unit <b>151</b> causes the link destination pictures coming from the control unit <b>101</b> to appear in positions different from that in which the picture currently reproduced by the reproduction unit <b>102</b> is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> is a schematic view of a typical screen displayed by the reproduction control unit <b>83</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. A moving picture display area <b>161</b> in an upper center position of the screen displays the picture (i.e., moving picture selected by the user) reproduced by the reproduction unit <b>102</b>. Link destination display areas <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>163</b>-<b>3</b> in the lower half of the screen display the link destinations applicable to the picture being displayed in the moving picture display area <b>161</b>. When the ongoing moving picture is changed, so are its link destinations. That is, what is displayed in the link destination display areas <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>163</b>-<b>3</b> varies with the current display in the moving picture display area <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">Apart from the currently reproduced scene, the reproduction control unit <b>83</b> can present the user with a scene of a predetermined length in which, say, the same child as the one appearing in the currently reproduced scene also appears.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">On the screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, any one of the pictures displayed in the link destination display areas <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>163</b>-<b>3</b> may be selected so that reproduction starts from the position of the selected moving picture. For example, if the picture in the link destination display area <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> is selected, the cluster headed by the selected picture is reproduced. The newly reproduced moving picture is displayed in the moving picture display area <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">The link destination display areas <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>163</b>-<b>3</b> may display either still pictures or moving pictures of the link destinations. If moving pictures are to be displayed, the scenes are reproduced over a predetermined time interval subsequent to the timestamps of the pictures established as the link destinations.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">A slide bar <b>162</b> located between the moving picture display area <b>161</b> and the link destination display areas <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>163</b>-<b>3</b> represents the current reproducing position in the entire moving picture file selected by the user for reproduction. The user may change the reproducing position by manipulating the slide bar <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">Described below with reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> is a reproducing process carried out by the reproduction control unit <b>83</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. In step S<b>131</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> of the reproduction control unit <b>83</b> acquires pictures coming from the capturing unit <b>81</b>. Illustratively, the control unit <b>101</b> outputs the acquired pictures successively starting from the first picture to the reproduction unit <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">In step S<b>132</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> checks the link data coming from the scene determination unit <b>82</b> in order to select, from the pictures supplied by the capturing unit <b>81</b>, the link destination pictures applicable to the currently reproduced picture. The link destination pictures selected by the control unit <b>101</b> are output to the link destination display unit <b>151</b>. If the currently reproduced picture has no link destinations, then no link destination picture is output to the link destination display unit <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">In step S<b>133</b>, the reproduction unit <b>102</b> starts reproducing the picture fed from the control unit <b>101</b>, and causes the reproduced picture to appear in a predetermined position on the display unit <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">In step S<b>134</b>, the link destination display unit <b>151</b> causes the link destination pictures sent from the control unit <b>101</b> to be displayed in predetermined positions on the display unit <b>37</b>. As a result, the display unit <b>37</b> displays the screen such as one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">In step S<b>135</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> checks to determine whether the link destination pictures applicable to the picture currently reproduced by the reproduction unit <b>102</b> are different from those displayed in the link destination display areas <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>163</b>-<b>3</b>. Once picture reproduction is started in step S<b>133</b>, the currently reproduced picture keeps changing over time. For that reason, the control unit <b>101</b> checks in step S<b>135</b> to see whether the link destination pictures applicable to the currently reproduced picture are being displayed correctly in the link destination display areas <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>163</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">If in step S<b>135</b> the control unit <b>101</b> determines that the link destination pictures applicable to the picture being reproduced by the reproduction unit <b>102</b> have become different from those displayed in the link destination display areas <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>163</b>-<b>3</b>, then step S<b>136</b> is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">In step S<b>136</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> supplies the link destination display unit <b>151</b> with the pictures to be displayed as new link destination pictures. In turn, the link destination display unit <b>151</b> causes the link destination display areas <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>163</b>-<b>3</b> to switch the link destination picture displays in keeping with the currently reproduced picture.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">If in step S<b>135</b> the control unit <b>101</b> determines that the link destination pictures applicable to the currently reproduced picture are not different from those displayed in the link destination display areas <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>163</b>-<b>3</b>, then step S<b>136</b> is skipped.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">In step S<b>137</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> checks to determine whether any of the link destination pictures being displayed in the link destination display areas <b>163</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>163</b>-<b>3</b> is selected as the new picture to be reproduced in response to the user's operations. If any such link destination picture is found selected for reproduction, then step S<b>138</b> is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">In step S<b>138</b>, with the link destination picture selected by the user, the control unit <b>101</b> supplies the reproduction unit <b>102</b> with the pictures subsequent to the timestamp of the selected link destination, and causes the unit <b>102</b> to start reproducing the pictures. This step terminates reproduction of the currently selected cluster and starts reproducing the cluster subsequent to the newly selected link destination.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">If in step S<b>137</b> no link destination is found selected, then step S<b>138</b> is skipped.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">In step S<b>139</b>, the control unit <b>101</b> determines whether the reproducing process is to be terminated.

<p id="p-0354" num="0353">In the foregoing description, the video camera <b>1</b> was shown only taking pictures and acquiring raw ID data while the personal computer <b>2</b> creates the meta data file based on the raw ID data and reproduces moving pictures in accordance with the created meta data. However, this is not limitative of the invention. Alternatively, the video camera <b>1</b> may take on the creation of meta data as well.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> is a schematic view showing a typical configuration of another picture-taking and display system to which this invention is applied. A video camera <b>301</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> picks up pictures to be reproduced as well as pictures for ID recognition use. Using raw ID data derived from the picked-up pictures, the video camera <b>301</b> creates a meta data file such as one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 through 31</figref> and stores the created file in an internal storage unit together with the pictures to be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">As indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, a player <b>302</b> captures the picked-up pictures and the meta data file from the video camera <b>301</b>. In keeping with the meta data file, as discussed above, the player <b>302</b> reproduces pictures on a cluster-by-cluster basis as specified in the &#x201c;ClusterData&#x201d; description and jumps from one cluster to another for reproduction as specified in the &#x201c;LinkData&#x201d; description.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> is a block diagram showing a typical structure of the video camera <b>301</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>. The video camera <b>301</b> is constituted by a video camera unit <b>311</b> and an information processing unit <b>312</b>. The video camera unit <b>311</b> has the same structure as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. That is, the video camera unit <b>311</b> stores into the storage unit <b>64</b> the pictures picked up through the lens <b>61</b> for reproduction purposes along with the raw ID data derived from the picked-up pictures.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">The information processing unit <b>312</b> has the same structure as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. That is, the information processing unit <b>312</b> reads raw ID data from the video camera unit <b>311</b> in order to create a meta data file, i.e., a file that contains link-related information and information about what is derived from a clustering and a filtering process performed on the result of ID recognition. The meta data file thus created is supplied to the video camera unit <b>311</b> and stored therein along with the pictures to be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">A sequence of picked-up pictures and the meta data file are retrieved from the storage unit <b>64</b>, and captured in wired or wireless fashion into the player <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> is a block diagram showing a typical functional structure of the player <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>. The player <b>302</b> has the same structure as that of the personal computer <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. At least part of the functional blocks in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> may be implemented by the CPU of the personal computer <b>2</b> executing suitable programs.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, the player <b>302</b> includes something other than the scene determination unit <b>82</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> for creating meta data. More specifically, the capturing unit <b>81</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> captures pictures and a meta data file from the video camera <b>301</b> and forwards what has been captured to the reproduction control unit <b>83</b>. The meta data file, created by the video camera <b>301</b> and sent from the capturing unit <b>81</b> to the reproduction control unit <b>83</b>, is the same as what has been described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 through 32</figref> above. Based on the meta data file provided by the capturing unit <b>81</b>, the reproduction control unit <b>83</b> reproduces pictures on a cluster-by-cluster basis as specified in the &#x201c;ClusterData&#x201d; description and jumps from one cluster to another for reproduction as specified in the &#x201c;LinkData&#x201d; description.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">Illustratively, when meta data is created on the side of the camera, the user may simply have the data captured into the player along with the picked-up pictures. This allows the pictures to be reproduced then and there by the player in accordance with the meta data.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> may thus be varied as needed. For example, the scene determination unit <b>82</b> may be shifted to the picture-taking side.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">Conversely, the DSP <b>63</b> on the picture-taking side may be shifted to the reproducing side. In this case, ID's are not recognized on the picture-taking side. Instead, pictures taken by the recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b> for ID recognition purposes are stored into the storage unit <b>64</b> together with the pictures taken by the moving picture taking area <b>71</b> for reproduction purposes. With these pictures captured, the reproducing side recognizes ID's from the pictures taken by the recognition-use picture taking area <b>72</b>, creates a meta data file based on the ID's thus recognized, and reproduces the pictures taken by the moving picture taking area <b>71</b> in accordance with the created meta data file.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">In the foregoing description, the meta data file was shown to be used for reproducing picked-up pictures. Alternatively, the user may store picked-up pictures onto a storage medium such as DVD, transmit the pictures to another apparatus over a network, or edit the pictures, all on a cluster-by-cluster basis.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">The series of steps or processes described above may be executed either by hardware or by software. For the software-based processing to take place, the programs constituting the software may be either incorporated beforehand in dedicated hardware of a computer or installed upon use over a network or from a suitable storage medium into a general-purpose personal computer or like equipment capable of executing diverse functions based on the installed programs.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the storage medium is offered to the user apart from the computer or like equipment not only as removable media <b>41</b> constituted by magnetic disks (including flexible disks), optical disks (including CD-ROM (compact disk-read only memory) and DVD (digital versatile disc)), magneto-optical disks (including MD (Mini-disc; registered trademark)), or a semiconductor memory, each of the media carrying the necessary programs; but also in the form of the ROM <b>32</b> or a hard disk drive included in the storage unit <b>38</b>, both accommodating the programs and incorporated beforehand in the computer.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of digital data processors, and more particularly to instruction sets for use in such processors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Programmable digital data processors use instructions, which are stored in memory, to tell the processor how to perform a specific task. Instructions typically include an operation code (opcode), which tells the processor what operation to perform, and operand specifiers, which indicate the location of input and output data used by the operation. The instructions to be performed by the processor are often stored in program memory and the data to be used by the instructions is often stored in data memory. Typical operations include loading data from memory, storing data to memory, performing arithmetic and logic operations, and branching to a different location in a program.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The amount of program memory used to implement a specific task or set of tasks is referred to as the code size. The code size depends on the size of the individual instructions, the complexity of the instructions, the complexity of the task or set of tasks, and other factors. In modern processors, instructions typically have a fixed size, since this allows the instructions to be efficiently fetched from memory, decoded, and executed. Because of how memory systems are designed, the instruction size in bits is often restricted to be a whole number power of two (e.g., 16 bits, 32 bits or 64 bits).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Small code size is an important goal in the design of low-power embedded processors, such as digital signal processors, multimedia processors and graphics processors. Thus, these types of architectures often feature compact instructions that are fairly powerful. For example, in a traditional embedded processor architecture, a 16-bit multiply-accumulate instruction might be used to specify that the values in two registers, RC and RB, should be multiplied together, and added to the value in an accumulator register, RA, with the result being stored back to the accumulator register RA.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve small code size, many processors implement Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) processing techniques. With SIMD processing, a single instruction is used to perform the same operation on multiple data operands. SIMD processing is especially useful when performing the same operation on multiple vector or matrix elements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">All programmable processors use some type of instruction format. Conventional instruction formats are described in, for example, John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson, &#x201c;Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach,&#x201d; Third Edition, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Inc., San Francisco, Calif., 2003.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve high performance, modern embedded processors for applications such as digital signal processing, multimedia and graphics often have Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) architectures. Examples are described in J. A. Fischer, &#x201c;Very Long Instruction Word Architectures and ELI-512,&#x201d; Proceedings of the Tenth Symposium on Computer Architecture, pp. 140-150, June 1983, R. Colwell et al., &#x201c;A VLIW Architecture for a Trace Scheduling Compiler,&#x201d; IEEE Transactions on Computers, pp. 967-979, August 1988, and N. Seshan, &#x201c;High VelociTI Processing: Texas Instruments VLIW DSP Architecture,&#x201d; IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 86-101, March 1998. With these architectures, a single VLIW specifies multiple operations that can execute in parallel. For example, a 256-bit VLIW might have eight operation fields, each of which is specified using 32 bits. Although VLIW architectures typically offer improved performance over architectures that perform only a single operation each cycle, they may have much larger code size, since operation fields that cannot be utilized in a given cycle are filled with no operation (NOP) instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">More recently, Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) architectures have been proposed. See, e.g., M. Smotherman, &#x201c;Understanding EPIC Architectures and Implementations,&#x201d; ACM Southeast Conference, 2002, and M. Schlansker and B. Rau, &#x201c;EPIC: Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing,&#x201d; IEEE Computer, pp. 37-45, February, 2000. These architectures often contain additional bits in the instruction, which indicate the operations in the instruction that can execute in parallel or if multiple instructions can execute in parallel. Although these architectures often have more compact code than VLIW processors, they add complexity to the processor hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, a need exists for an improved approach to achieving small code size, particularly in low-power embedded processors, which avoids the problems associated with the above-described VLIW and EPIC approaches.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention in an illustrative embodiment provides a processor which processes instructions in a compound instruction format. More particularly, up to three compound operations may be specified using only 64 bits. The compound instruction format achieves a small code size, and is well suited for low-power, high-performance embedded processors, such as digital signal processors, multimedia processors and graphics processors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a processor comprises a memory, an instruction decoder coupled to the memory for decoding instructions retrieved therefrom, and a plurality of execution units for executing the decoded instructions. One or more of the instructions are in a compound instruction format in which a single instruction comprises multiple operation fields, with one or more of the operation fields each comprising at least an operation code field and a function field. The operation code field and the function field together specify a particular operation to be performed by one or more of the execution units.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Example operation codes in the illustrative embodiment include jump, constant, integer, load, store, copy to special register, copy from special register, and single instruction multiple data. The operation code and function fields may have fixed sizes and locations within the operation fields, so as to facilitate decoding and execution.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a given one of the instructions in the compound instruction format may comprise, in addition to multiple operation fields, at least one additional field comprising a dependency field. The dependency field may comprise a single-bit field which indicates if compound operations designated in the multiple operation fields should be executed sequentially or in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the illustrative embodiment, a given one of the instructions in the compound instruction format comprises a 64-bit instruction having three 21-bit operation fields and a one-bit dependency field, although other formats may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As another example, a given one of the instructions in the compound instruction format may comprise a compound operation that is specified by two or more multiple operation fields of the instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One or more of the operation fields of a given one of the instructions in the compound instruction format may be restricted in terms of the particular operations which can be designated thereby. For example, one or more of the operation fields of the given instruction may be restricted to single instruction multiple data operations.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The compound instruction format in the illustrative embodiment advantageously overcomes the problems associated with the above-noted conventional VLIW and EPIC approaches.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention will be described in the context of a number of exemplary processor configurations. It should be understood, however, that the invention does not require the particular arrangements shown, and can be implemented using other types of digital data processors and associated processing circuitry. The present invention is generally suitable for implementation in any processor that can benefit from small code size and high performance processing. Such processors include, by way of example, programmable digital signal processors, multimedia processors and graphics processors.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A given processor as described herein may be implemented in the form of one or more integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrative embodiment of the invention, a compound instruction format is provided which allows up to three powerful compound operations to be specified using only 64 bits. The compound instruction format is well suited for low-power, high-performance embedded processors, such as the above-noted digital signal processors, multimedia processors and graphics processors.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a processor <b>100</b> in which instructions having the compound instruction format are processed. The processor <b>100</b> comprises program memory <b>102</b>, data memory <b>104</b>, an instruction decoder <b>106</b>, a register file <b>108</b>, and a plurality of execution units <b>110</b>. The execution units <b>110</b> communicate with data memory <b>104</b> and register file <b>108</b> over respective bus lines <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although shown as separate elements in the figure, program memory <b>102</b> and data memory <b>104</b> may comprise different portions of a single memory, or other memory arrangements. Also, at least a portion of one or both of the memories <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be external to the processor <b>100</b> in alternative embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In general, the program memory <b>102</b> is used to store instructions to be executed by the processor <b>100</b>, while the data memory <b>104</b> stores data that is operated on by the instructions. Instructions are fetched from the program memory <b>102</b> by the instruction decoder <b>106</b> which operates in conjunction with the register file <b>108</b> and the execution units <b>110</b> in controlling the execution of the instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The processor <b>100</b> may comprise an embedded processor, for example, one that is embedded in application-specific integrated circuit associated with a mobile telephone, personal digital assistant or other portable computing device, or otherwise embedded within the device itself.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A more detailed example of a multithreaded version of processor <b>100</b> will be described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows the compound instruction format utilized in processor <b>100</b> in the illustrative embodiment. The compound instruction format includes three 21-bit compound operation fields, denoted Operation <b>1</b>, Operation <b>2</b> and Operation <b>3</b>, and an optional 1-bit dependency field, d. In this example, the 64 bits of the compound instruction format are designated as bits <b>0</b> to <b>63</b>, with the Operation <b>3</b> field comprising bits <b>0</b> to <b>20</b>, the Operation <b>2</b> field comprising bits <b>21</b> to <b>41</b>, the Operation <b>1</b> field comprising bits <b>42</b> to <b>62</b>, and the dependency field d comprising bit <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The dependency field d indicates if the compound operations designated in the Operation <b>1</b>, Operation <b>2</b> and Operation <b>3</b> fields should be executed sequentially or in parallel. For example, in one possible single-bit field implementation, if d is equal to one, then the compound operations contain dependencies and must be executed sequentially. If d is equal to zero, all three compound operations can execute in parallel. In other implementations, multiple bit dependency fields, with other types of logic indicators, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A wide variety of alternative formats are possible. For example, certain compound operations that require more than 21 bits may use two operation fields. It is also possible to vary the instruction length, operation field lengths, field locations, and other aspects of the format in order to accommodate the needs of a particular application. Thus, the instruction need not be 64 bits in length, but could be longer or shorter. Also, there could be more or fewer than three operation fields, and the various operation fields in a given instruction may have different lengths rather than all having the same length as in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> example.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The compound instruction format of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> allows very powerful compound instructions to be specified using only 64 bits. This reduces code size and improves processor performance, which is important in low-power digital signal processing, multimedia and graphics processing applications.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The compound instruction format is also flexible and allows a wide variety of instructions to be specified. However, restrictions may be placed on the types of compound operations allowed in each operation field to reduce the design complexity of the processor. As one possible example, a particular implementation may restrict Operation <b>1</b> to be only Jump or Const operations, Operation <b>2</b> to be only Integer or Load/Store operations, and Operation <b>3</b> to be only SIMD operations.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows several potential formats for compound operations. Each compound operation field is 21 bits, but the format for these operations may differ based on the type of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The leftmost field in these examples is always five bits and corresponds to the opcode, which specifies the type of operation to be performed (e.g., Jump, Const, Integer, Load, Store, ctsr, cfsr or SIMD). The meanings of the various opcode names are summarized in TABLE 1 below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The rightmost field, function, is always four bits in these examples. Together the opcode field and function field specify the particular operation to be performed by the compound operation. The opcode and function fields have fixed sizes and locations to facilitate decoding the operation and sending it to the correct execution unit. The remaining operation fields vary based on the opcode and function. The meanings of the operation fields are summarized in TABLE 2 below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is to be appreciated that the particular details of the compound operations as set forth in TABLE 1 and TABLE 2 are merely examples, and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example of assembly language code for a single 64-bit compound instruction with three compound operations. The notation &#x2225; between operations indicates that all three compound operations execute in parallel. This instruction implements the inner loop of a vector sum-of-squares computation. The first compound operation, lvu, loads a vector register vr<b>0</b> with four 16-bit vector elements and updates an address pointer r<b>3</b> to the next element. The vmulreds operation reads four fixed-point (fractional) 16-bit vector elements from vr<b>0</b>, multiplies each element by itself, saturates each product, adds all four saturated products plus an accumulator register, ac<b>0</b>, with saturation after each addition, and stores the result back in ac<b>0</b>. The loop operation decrements the loop count register lc<b>0</b>, compares it to zero, and branches to address L<b>0</b> if the result is not zero.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Compared to conventional instruction and operation formats, the formats of the illustrative embodiment have several advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, they allow powerful compound instructions, composed of up to three compound operations, to be specified using only 64 bits. This helps to improve processor code size, power consumption and performance.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Second, the compound instruction format is flexible, since it allows a wide variety of compound operations to be specified.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Third, by allowing the compound instructions to be executed either sequentially or in parallel, the instruction format allows code to be optimized for both size and performance.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Fourth, restrictions may be placed on the type of operation allowed in each operation field to reduce the design complexity of the processor. In the example given above, a particular implementation may restrict Operation <b>1</b> to be only Jump or Const operations, Operation <b>2</b> to be only Integer or Load/Store operations, and Operation <b>3</b> to be only SIMD operations. Numerous other types of restrictions may be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Fifth, certain compound operations that require more than 21 bits may use, for example, two operation fields, where the second operations field provides an extended immediate value.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The present invention may be implemented in a multithreaded processor. A more particular example of a multithreaded processor in which the invention may be implemented is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/269,372, filed Oct. 11, 2002 and entitled &#x201c;Multithreaded Processor With Efficient Processing For Convergence Device Applications,&#x201d; which is commonly assigned herewith and incorporated by reference herein. This multithreaded processor may be configured to execute RISC-based control code, DSP code, Java code and network processing code. It includes a single instruction multiple data (SIMD) vector processing unit, a reduction unit, and long instruction word (LIW) compounded instruction execution. Examples of threading and pipelining techniques suitable for use with this exemplary multithreaded processor are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/269,245, filed Oct. 11, 2002 and entitled &#x201c;Method and Apparatus for Token Triggered Multithreading,&#x201d; now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,842,848, which is commonly assigned herewith and incorporated by reference herein.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The multithreaded processor <b>400</b> includes, among other elements, a multithreaded cache memory <b>410</b>, a multithreaded data memory <b>412</b>, an instruction buffer <b>414</b>, an instruction decoder <b>416</b>, a register file <b>418</b>, and a memory management unit (MMU) <b>420</b>.

Of course, other values of N may be used, as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>

The offset unit <b>452</b> inserts explicit bits into register file addresses so that independent thread data is not corrupted. For a given thread, these explicit bits may comprise, e.g., a corresponding thread identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in the figure, the register file <b>418</b> is coupled to input registers RA and RB, the outputs of which are coupled to an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) block <b>454</b>, which may comprise an adder. The input registers RA and RB are used in implementing instruction pipelining. The output of the ALU block <b>454</b> is coupled to the data memory <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The register file <b>418</b>, integer instruction queue <b>450</b>, offset unit <b>452</b>, elements RA and RB, and ALU block <b>454</b> collectively comprise an exemplary integer unit.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Instruction types executable in the processor <b>400</b> include Branch, Load, Store, Integer and Vector/SIMD instruction types. If a given instruction does not specify a Branch, Load, Store or Integer operation, it is a Vector/SIMD instruction. Other instruction types can also or alternatively be used. The Integer and Vector/SIMD instruction types are examples of what are more generally referred to herein as integer and vector instruction types, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A vector IQ <b>456</b> receives Vector/SIMD instructions forwarded from the instruction decoder <b>416</b>. A corresponding offset unit <b>458</b>, shown as including a separate instance for each of the threads, serves to insert the appropriate bits to ensure that independent thread data is not corrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A vector unit <b>460</b> of the processor <b>400</b> is separated into N distinct parallel portions, and includes a vector file <b>462</b> which is similarly divided. The vector file <b>462</b> includes thirty-two registers, denoted VR<b>00</b> through VR<b>31</b>. The vector file <b>462</b> serves substantially the same purpose as the register file <b>418</b> except that the former operates on Vector/SIMD instruction types.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The vector unit <b>460</b> illustratively comprises the vector instruction queue <b>456</b>, the offset unit <b>458</b>, the vector file <b>462</b>, and the arithmetic and storage elements associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The operation of the vector unit <b>460</b> is as follows. A Vector/SIMD block encoded either as a fractional or integer data type is read from the vector file <b>462</b> and is stored into architecturally visible registers VRA, VRB, VRC. From there, the flow proceeds through multipliers (MPY) that perform parallel concurrent multiplication of the Vector/SIMD data. Adder units comprising carry-skip adders (CSAs) and CPAs may perform additional arithmetic operations. For example, one or more of the CSAs may be used to add in an accumulator value from a vector register file, and one or more of the CPAs may be used to perform a final addition for completion of a multiplication operation, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Computation results are stored in Result registers <b>464</b>, and are provided as input operands to the reduction unit <b>402</b>. The reduction unit <b>402</b> sums the input operands in such a way that the summation result produced is the same as that which would be obtained if each operation were executed in series. The reduced sum is stored in the accumulator register file <b>406</b> for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When performing vector dot products, the MPY blocks perform four multiplies in parallel, the CSA and CPA units perform additional operations or simply pass along the multiplication results for storage in the Result registers <b>464</b>, and the reduction unit <b>402</b> sums the multiplication results, along with an accumulator value stored in the accumulator register file <b>406</b>. The result generated by the reduction unit is then stored in the accumulator register file for use in the next iteration, in the manner previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The accumulator register file <b>406</b> in this example includes a total of sixteen accumulator registers denoted ACC<b>00</b> through ACC<b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The multithreaded processor <b>400</b> may make use of techniques for thread-based access to register files, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/269,373, filed Oct. 11, 2002 and entitled &#x201c;Method and Apparatus for Register File Port Reduction in a Multithreaded Processor,&#x201d; which is commonly assigned herewith and incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The multithreaded processor <b>400</b> is well suited for use in performing vector dot products and other types of parallel vector multiply and reduce operations, as described in the above-cited U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/841,261.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It should again be noted that the particular processor configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> are presented by way of illustrative example only, and additional or alternative elements not explicitly shown may be included, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It should also be emphasized that the present invention does not require the particular compound instruction and operation formats shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>. The invention can be implemented using a wide variety of other types of instructions and operations, with other instruction and operation formats.</p>
