<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A glove employable for mixed martial arts, including striking and grappling, employs a dorsal pad having distal and lateral extensions with an integral bend for covering both the dorsal and lateral sides of the user's metacarpal/proximal phalange joints. The integral bend conforms with the user's metacarpal/proximal phalange joints with the user's hand in the clinched fist position. The glove affords protection to the user's metacarpal/proximal phalange joints while striking. On the other hand, the integral bend is capable of easily unbending to an open position for grappling. The integral bend is unbent by unclenching the user's fingers by flexion from the clinched fist position to the open position. The glove also includes a wrist pad for protecting the wrist against heavy strikes.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The glove of the present application is intended for use in mixed martial arts competitions. The key advancements made with this design relate to the shape of the glove and to the structure of the wrist. The shape of the foam may be reproduced in at least two ways, viz., (a) by bending the foam, or (b) by producing the foam inside a mold.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The glove of the present application provides superior hand protection by cupping the sides of the fist with padding, and by creating a bent-hand design. Prior art MMA gloves are built to cover the front of the knuckles when the hand is drawn into a fist, but do not provide adequate protection for unorthodox strikes such as the hammer fist (which strikes with the side of the fist) or the wide hook punch (which often impacts on the inside corner of the fist, near the base of the pointer finger). Using such strikes when wearing common MMA gloves can lead to serious injuries for both the striker and the person being struck. Additionally, the design of prior art MMA gloves presumes that the hand at rest should be open flat, or slightly bent. Such gloves require the wearer to draw their hand into fist before punching. The glove of the present application is designed on the premise that at rest the fighter's hand should be bent significantly, so that making a fist is easy and extending the fingers requires more effort. This bent-hand design reduces the risk of accidental finger-related injuries such as finger dislocation and eye-gouging.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The glove of the present application <b>1</b> has three preferred embodiments. In each of the preferred embodiments, the hand design is similar. The variation occurs in the wrist structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example No. 1</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Key features of the glove of Example No. 1 include:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0029">1. The dorsal pad (<b>1</b>) incorporates bent multilayer foam that focuses the striker's impact zone on the glove. An integral bend (<b>3</b>) employs a layer of high density foam (<b>7</b>) sandwiched between two layers of low density foam (<b>6</b>). The integral bend (<b>3</b>) is achieved by gluing these layers to one another while oriented in the desired bent position.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0030">2. Combination of layers of high density foam and soft foam increases the shock absorption of the gloves padding immensely.
        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0031">a. Prior art open finger gloves have featured a &#x201c;clinch your hand into a fist&#x201d; design style. The glove of the present application naturally bends the user's hand into a fist position and thus the effort is not to close the hand but to open it.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0032">3. Cupping the sides of the fist with padding is another departure from prior designs as martial arts and boxing gloves typically have padding on top of the hand not on the sides.
        <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0033">a. Training and fighting &#x201c;accidents&#x201d; are reduced by the new concepts of specially formed padding on either side of the gloves covering the sides of the fist.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0034">4. While training against striking techniques, wrists are frequently injured by the opponent's larger bones. With the incorporation of dense foam and leather into the wrist pad (<b>8</b>) of the wrist strap, proper flexibility is maintained in specific angles while guarding against shock.
        <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0035">a. Prior art designs have incorporated wrist support but never strong padding for the wrist that was intended to be shock resistant.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0036">Dorsal face of the gloves may be either fiat or may include split fingers. Embodiments may employ hook and loop fastening mechanism, elastic, laces, or buckles and equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0037">The wrist strap of the glove of Example No. 1 employs flexible leather (or synthetic leather) with Velcro to secure the glove. The flexibility of this leather wrist strap is comparable to what can be found in the wrist straps of prior art MMA gloves.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0038">In another embodiment of Example No. 1, the wrist strap employs leather (or synthetic leather) with Velcro is again used to secure the glove but additionally, the wrist is given a wrist pad (<b>8</b>) having shock-absorbent foam reinforcement. This internal structural difference helps maintain the wrist in proper form for punching and also helps guard the wrist against impacts from kicks and other blows.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0039">In the third embodiment of Example No. 1, the wrist strap is replaced with boxing-style laces, which draw tight and tie together to provide a secure closure to the wrist. Although the closure system differs in this embodiment, there are some similarities in the wrist design. In all three variations, there is a flap which closes over the wrist, drawing from the inside of the wrist toward the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0040">The glove of the present invention is specially formed to encourage proper punching form and shaped to cover zones that are not ordinarily protected by gloves of this type, helping reduce injuries that occur when a combatant does not make a proper fist while striking, strikes with heavy contact, or at unorthodox angle. The glove also offers protection for the wrist, both in terms of wrist support and also in case the wrist is struck with force, e.g., by a kick.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example No. 2</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0041">Competitive and tactical training martial arts training often features injuries with open finger gloves and heavy contact because of powerful strikes. Even while making a proper fist accidents or injuries frequently occur when a striker hits with an unorthodox angle.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0042">The molded foam mixed martial arts (MMA) glove of Example No. 2 is specially formed to encourage proper punching form and shaped to cover zones that are not ordinarily protected by gloves of this type, helping to reduce injuries that occur when a combatant does not make a proper fist while striking, strikes with heavy contact, or at unorthodox angle. The glove also offers protection for the wrist, both in terms of wrist support and also in case the wrist is struck with force, e.g., by a kick.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0063">Preferred Materials and Alternate Materials:</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0064">The glove is constructed using an advanced, man-made leather (herein referred to as MML), composed of a non-woven fabric. It consists of ultra-fine fibers, as fine as 0.05 micron to imitate collagen fiber bundles. The bundles are impregnated with polyurethane to improve flexibility and conformability. The fabric is three times stronger than leather, requiring only a third of real leather's weight to achieve equal tear strength. More durable and consistent than real leather, the material resists abrasion better, will not dry out or become brittle, and does not wear down after years of use. If man-made leather matching these specifications is not available, then to ensure quality, the glove can be made from Grade A natural leather.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0065">Multiple shock-absorbent cushioning materials are used in this design, including a polymer composite containing a chemically engineered dilatant to function as an energy absorber. This advanced material, used to absorb the heaviest impacts, is lightweight, soft and flexible but on shock locks together to absorb and disperse energy, before instantly returning to its flexible state. If this advanced material is not available, a thicker layer of dense, closed cell foam can be used in its place to ensure user safety and product longevity.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0066">The textile or surface layer may be treated with an antimicrobial agent to reduce odor-causing and/or pathogenic microorganisms. Examples of such antimicrobial agents include: silane functionalized quaternary amines such as Microbe Shield&#x2122; available from AEGIS Environments; colloidal silver solutions such as Silpure&#x2122; available from Thompson Research Associates, Canada, silver chelated polymer solutions such as SilvaDur&#x2122; available from Rohm &#x26; Haas; biguanides such as polyhexamethylene biguanide sold under the trade names Vantocil&#x2122; and Cosmocil&#x2122; available from Arch Chemicals; and a formulation sold under the name of GermPro&#x2122; available from GermPatrol LLC, Largo, Fla.</p>
