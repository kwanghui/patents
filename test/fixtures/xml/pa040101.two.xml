<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>[0001]</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>[0002]</number> The present invention relates to a garment, and more specifically to a garment adapted for assisting a person to releasably secure one or both hands to his or her upper body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>[0003]</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>[0004]</number> Various devices have been proposed for wear on a body to assist a person in maintaining his or her arms or legs in a desired position. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,137 to Bustance describes an athletic training device adapted to be worn by a boxer to help maintain the boxer's arms in the desired "ready" position during training exercises. The device in Bustance includes a vest element worn around the torso and a pair of sleeve elements worn around the bicep region of each arm. The vest and sleeve elements each include attachment means for releasably attaching the sleeves to the vest. This device improves the boxer's form by training him to hold his upper arms tightly against the sides of his torso while in the defensive position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>[0005]</number> In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,747,779 to Gerstung describes a form-keeping device for training gymnasts or spring-board divers to hold their legs and feet together during a gymnastic exercise or a dive. The device in Gerstung comprises a pair of straps adapted to be worn around the ankles and a pair of spacing elements configured to maintain the ankles at a fixed distance apart. Each of the ankle straps includes a portion having a loop or hook material for releasably attaching the two straps together during use to keep the ankles together during the desired routine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>[0006]</number> In yet another example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,334 to Proffer describes a harness adapted for wear by the front rider of a tandem pair on a motorcycle. The harness is provided with a number of handholds for enabling the rear rider to hold on to the front rider. The handholds are positioned on the garment such that the rear rider can comfortably maintain his or her arms around the waist of the front rider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>[0007]</number> Although various garment-type devices have been proposed for assisting persons to maintain their arms or legs in desired positions during physical activities, none of the proposed devices provides a means for assisting persons to releasably secure their hands to a desired location along their upper body. Such a device is very desirable for a number of reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>[0008]</number> For example, larger individuals are often quite uncomfortable during travel, such as by airplane, bus or train, because seats on these vehicles are typically not well-suited for larger body sizes and cannot be adjusted in width. As a result, the arms of larger individuals tend to extend over the armrest and thereby contact adjacent passengers. Worse yet, an individual's arm may extend into an aisle where it can be hit and injured by passersby or food carts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>[0009]</number> To avoid contacting other passengers and objects, some individuals have found it helpful to cross their arms and lay their hands flatly against their chest with their palms facing their torso. This position effectively narrows the individual's body width and thereby helps to prevent the problems just described. However, this position is difficult or impossible to maintain for extended periods due to the resulting muscle strain on the individual's shoulders and arms. The muscle strain and the associated discomfort can make it difficult or impossible for the passenger to relax or sleep during travel. Moreover, it has been found that prolonged muscle strain can lead to long-term health problems, such as, for example, tendinitis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>[0010]</number> Another situation where it would be desirable for a person to maintain one or both hands along his or her upper body is after an injury. Following an injury to an arm or shoulder, a sling is typically used to immobilize the arm. However, in many situations, a conventional sling may be uncomfortable, cumbersome or impractical. Furthermore, during the latter stages of the healing process, it may be desirable to use an injured arm for limited purposes; however, it can be very cumbersome to take off and put on a sling each time the person wishes to use his or her arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>[0011]</number> Another situation where it would be desirable for a person to maintain one or both hands along the upper body is during transportation of a victim via a stretcher or similar means. Many stretchers do not include a strap or belt for securing the victim onto the stretcher. Other times, a victim is unable or unwilling to accept being secured to a stretcher via a strap. When no strap is used, it is difficult to prevent the victim's arms from falling over the sides of the stretcher, particularly if the victim is particularly large or the stretcher is narrow. If one or both of the victim's arms fall over the sides of the stretcher it can seriously aggravate an existing injury or result in an additional injury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>[0012]</number> Another situation where it would be desirable for a person to maintain one or both hands along the upper body is for minimizing the effects of certain neurological disorders. Some types of neurological disorders may be outwardly manifested by conditions such as body tremors or involuntary muscular movements. At times, such as in certain social situations or for safety concerns, it would be desirable to provide a device to help stabilize the person's hands and/or arms to prevent involuntary movements of the hands and/or arms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>[0013]</number> Thus, for at least these reasons, there remains a very real and substantial need for a new and improved garment that can be used to releasably secure a user's hands to the upper body in a desired position, such as in a folded configuration. Such a garment would be beneficial for the reasons described above and would be particularly useful for allowing larger individuals to travel in greater comfort. To be practical, it is desirable that such a garment be comfortable to wear. It is also desirable that such a garment has a minimum number of parts and utilizes simple attachment means for convenience and ease of use. It is also desirable that such a garment is constructed of durable materials that can be washed and reused. Finally, it is desirable that such a garment be inexpensive to manufacture, aesthetically appealing, and versatile enough for a wide range of applications. The present invention addresses these needs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>[0014]</number> A primary object of the present invention is to provide a garment that enables a person to releasably secure one or both hands to his or her upper body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>[0015]</number> In one aspect, the garment comprises an upper portion, such as a vest or shirt, adapted for wear on the user's torso region. The upper portion has at least a region formed with a first attachment means. The garment also comprises a hand portion, such as a glove or strap, adapted for wear along at least one of the user's hands. The hand portion has a region formed with a second attachment means that is releasably engageable to the first attachment means for attaching the user's hands to his or her upper body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>[0016]</number> In another aspect, a variety of attachment means can be used with the present invention including, but not limited to, loop and hook materials, buttons, hooks, snaps and clasps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>[0017]</number> In another aspect, the upper portion of the garment is in the form of a strap that can be worn around the user's neck. The first attachment means is preferably located along the ends of the strap. The strap may include a padded region along the portion of the strap that passes along the back of the user's neck. The padded region increases the user's comfort and can be used to support the user's head during rest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>[0018]</number> In another aspect, the upper portion of the garment comprises a shoulder strap or a chest strap having a section with the first attachment means disposed along the outer surface of the strap. The hand portion, such as a glove, is releasably engageable to the strap for immobilizing one or both hands or arms. The embodiment using the shoulder strap is particularly well-suited for immobilizing an injured arm during rehabilitation. This embodiment has numerous advantages over a conventional sling, such as, for example, the arm can be easily detached or reattached to the strap as needed and the arm can be attached at a selectable location along the strap to increase comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>[0019]</number> In another aspect, a method of manufacturing the garment is provided. In one preferred embodiment, the method generally comprises providing an upper portion adapted for wear on the torso region of the user's body, the upper portion being formed of a loop material that is adapted to be releasably engageable with a hook material.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>[0036]</number> Larger individuals are often uncomfortable while seated on vehicles such as airplanes, buses or trains because their arms tend to extend over the armrests and contact adjacent passengers or passersby. As a result, many individuals have found it helpful to place their arms in a folded position across their chest. This position effectively narrows their body width and helps to avoid contact with others. Unfortunately, however, this position can be very difficult to maintain, particularly during longer trips. Therefore, a need exists for a garment system that provides users with the ability to releasably secure their hands or arms at selectable locations along their upper body. Such a device would help prevent muscle strain and thereby significantly increase the user's comfort during travel. Such a device would also be useful in a wide variety of other applications, such as for maintaining a user's hands or arms in a fixed position during rehabilitation after an injury or to help control body tremors resulting from neurological disorders. To be practical, the garment system must be reliable, convenient and easy to transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>[0037]</number> To address these needs, the present invention provides a new and improved garment adapted for providing users with the ability to releasably secure their hands or arms along their upper body. Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for purposes of illustration, a preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a garment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including, generally, an upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a pair of hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is worn over the torso and can take a variety of different forms, such as, for example, a shirt, a vest or a sweater. The upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a material that provides a first attachment means, such as, for example, a loop material. Alternatively, patches of material can be sewn or otherwise attached to the upper portion of the garment to provide first attachment means in specific locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>[0038]</number> The hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably comprise a pair of gloves with open fingers for comfort and convenience. However, it will be appreciated that the hand portions may take a variety of different forms. Furthermore, the hand portions may be worn on the wrists or forearms and therefore the term "hand portions" should not be construed as limited to articles adapted for wear only on the hands. The hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> include at least a region of material, such as, for example, a hook material, that provides a second attachment means. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided with a region of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the palm. The second attachment means releasably adheres to the first attachment means for providing the user with the ability to affix at least one hand to his or her upper body at a selectable location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>[0039]</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> during use wherein the garment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides a comfortable and convenient means for maintaining the user's hands in a fixed position along his or her upper body. As discussed above, this garment is particularly well suited for larger people while traveling on vehicles, such as on airplanes, buses, or trains, wherein the seats are often too narrow for their body size. By enabling the user to easily maintain his or her arms in a desired position along his or her upper body, the user's arms are prevented from contacting adjacent passengers or passersby and therefore the user can relax or sleep in comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>[0040]</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the user places his or her palms against his or her upper body in the desired location, the region of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the palm of each of the hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> removably adheres to the material on the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the user can relax his or her shoulders and arms and permit the garment to bear the load of the dead weight of the arms. As a result, muscle strain and tendonitis in the arms and shoulders can be avoided. The first and second attachment means are chosen to be sufficiently strong such that the dead weight of the arms will not cause the first and second attachment means to separate disadvantageously. As discussed below, this garment can take many different forms; however, each of the forms is manufactured to be capable of providing the user with a reliable means to support of one or both arms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>[0041]</number> Additional components may be attached to the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the garment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be provided for enhanced head and neck support. The neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably provided with at least a region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of second attachment means, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for adhering to the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along the front shoulder region. The neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can include an additional region <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of second attachment means for attachment along the back of the user's collar on the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The neck pad may take a variety of forms, such as, for example, a stuffed pillow or an inflatable tube. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> during use. In addition, similar pads may be attached to other areas of the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the garment, such as, for example, along the forearms, elbows or on a shoulder, for enhancing the user's comfort. Furthermore, pockets (not shown) may be attached to the upper portion at selectable locations for a wide variety of different purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>[0042]</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative embodiment of a garment according to the present invention wherein the upper portion comprises a crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably attaches to itself at attachment location <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to form a loop. The loop of the crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed over the head and is provided with first attachment means at least along the strap ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A significant feature of this embodiment is the ability to take the crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on and off quickly and easily, as compared with a sweater or vest. The crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> may include a padded neck region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for enhanced head and neck support. Hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> similar to the gloves illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> may be used with the crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as illustrated during use in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>[0043]</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment of a garment according the to present invention wherein the upper portion is provided in the form of a non-crossing strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is placed around the back of the neck and lays over the front region of the shoulders. The strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided with a first attachment means at least along the strap ends <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> also includes a padded neck region <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for enhanced head and neck support. Hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> similar to the gloves illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> may be used with the strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, as illustrated during use in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>[0044]</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> illustrate alternative embodiments of hand portions comprising straps that are worn around the hands or wrists. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the hand portions comprising palm straps <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that wrap around the palm region of the hand. Each palm strap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes an attachment region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provided with a second attachment means. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the hand portions comprising wrist straps <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each wrist strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes an attachment region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provided with a second attachment means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>[0045]</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates yet another embodiment of the garment that is particularly well suited for immobilizing a victim's arm, such as, during rehabilitation after an injury. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the upper portion of the garment comprises a shoulder strap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> adapted for wear across one shoulder. A region of first attachment means is provided at least along a region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the exterior of the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. During use, the user wears a hand portion, such as one of the wrist straps <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, provided with a second attachment means adapted to releasably attach to the first attachment means <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at a selectable location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>[0046]</number> The embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is particularly advantageous for applications wherein a sling may be impractical or cumbersome. This embodiment also advantageously allows the user to quickly and easily detach the wrist strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and thereby free the injured arm when necessary. In contrast, it is much more difficult to remove a conventional sling and then replace the arm in the sling when finished.
