<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The interaction between TR-2 and its ligand, TRAIL, plays a role in the induction of apoptosis (see, for example, Almasan et al., Cytokine &#x26; Growth Factor Reviews 14: 337-348 (2003)). TRAIL, also known as Apo2 ligand, is a homomeric ligand that interacts with four members of the TNF-receptor superfamily (TRAIL receptors (&#x201c;TR&#x201d;) 1 to 4), as well as with the related, soluble, opsteoprotegerin (&#x201c;OPG&#x201d;) receptor. Binding of TRAIL to TR-1 or TR-2 at the surface of a cell triggers apoptosis of that cell. After initial binding of TRAIL to TR-1 or TR-2, intracellular proteins are recruited to the intracellular death domain of the receptor, forming a signaling complex. Certain intracellular caspases are recruited to the complex; where they autoactivate and in turn activate additional caspases and the intracellular apoptosis cascade. TR-3 and TR-4 and OPG lack the intracellular domain responsible for transmitting the apoptosis signal. Thus, binding of TRAIL to TR-3, TR-4, or OPG does not trigger apoptosis. TR-3 and TR-4 are also referred to as &#x201c;decoy&#x201d; receptors, and their overexpression has been shown to protect cells from apoptotic induction by TRAIL. TR-2 is expressed in a variety of cells, including liver, brain, breast, kidney, colon, lung, spleen, thymus, peripheral blood lymphocytes, prostate, testis, ovary, uterus, and various tissues along the gastro-intestinal tract. (See, for example, Walczak et al., EMBO J. 16: 5386-5397 (1997); Spierings et al., J. Histochem. Cytochem. 52: 821-831 (2004)). Though TRAIL and TRAIL receptors are widely expressed, they are most active in inducing apoptosis in transformed cells. (See, for example, Daigle et al., Swiss Med. Wkly. 131: 231-237 (2001)).</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0216">The term &#x201c;naturally-occurring&#x201d; as applied to an object means that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory or otherwise is naturally-occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0217">The term &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; as used herein refers to components that are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. For example, in the context of a polynucleotide sequence, a control sequence may be &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; to a coding sequence when the control sequence and coding sequence are in association with each other in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the functioning of the control sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0218">The term &#x201c;control sequence&#x201d; refers to polynucleotide sequences which may effect the expression and processing of coding sequences with which they are in association. The nature of such control sequences may differ depending upon the host organism. Certain exemplary control sequences for prokaryotes include, but are not limited to, promoters, ribosomal binding sites, and transcription termination sequences. Certain exemplary control sequences for eukaryotes include, but are not limited to, promoters, enhancers, and transcription termination sequences. In certain embodiments, &#x201c;control sequences&#x201d; can include leader sequences and/or fusion partner sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0219">In certain embodiments, a first polynucleotide coding sequence is operably linked to a second polynucleotide coding sequence when the first and second polynucleotide coding sequences are transcribed into a single contiguous mRNA that can be translated into a single contiguous polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0220">In the context of polypeptides, two or more polypeptides are &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; if each linked polypeptide is able to function in its intended manner. A polypeptide that is able to function in its intended manner when operably linked to another polypeptide may or may not be able to function in its intended manner when not operably linked to another polypeptide. For example, in certain embodiments, a first polypeptide may be unable to function in its intended manner when unlinked, but may be stabilized by being linked to a second polypeptide such that it becomes able to function in its intended manner. Alternatively, in certain embodiments, a first polypeptide may be able to function in its intended manner when unlinked, and may retain that ability when operably linked to a second polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0221">As used herein, two or more polypeptides are &#x201c;fused&#x201d; when the two or more polypeptides are linked by translating them as a single contiguous polypeptide sequence or by synthesizing them as a single contiguous polypeptide sequence. In certain embodiments, two or more fused polypeptides may have been translated in vivo from two or more operably linked polynucleotide coding sequences. In certain embodiments, two or more fused polypeptides may have been translated in vitro from two or more operably linked polynucleotide coding sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0222">As used herein, two or more polypeptides are &#x201c;operably fused&#x201d; if each linked polypeptide is able to function in its intended manner.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0223">In certain embodiments, a first polypeptide that contains two or more distinct polypeptide units is considered to be linked to a second polypeptide so long as at least one of the distinct polypeptide units of the first polypeptide is linked to the second polypeptide. As a non-limiting example, in certain embodiments, an antibody is considered linked to a second polypeptide in all of the following instances: (a) the second polypeptide is linked to one of the heavy chain polypeptides of the antibody; (b) the second polypeptide is linked to one of the light chain polypeptides of the antibody; (c) a first molecule of the second polypeptide is linked to one of the heavy chain polypeptides of the antibody and a second molecule of the second polypeptide is linked to one of the light chain polypeptides of the antibody; and (d) first and second molecules of the second polypeptide are linked to the first and second heavy chain polypeptides of the antibody and third and fourth molecules of the second polypeptide are linked to first and second light chain polypeptides of the antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0224">In certain embodiments, the language &#x201c;a first polypeptide linked to a second polypeptide&#x201d; encompasses situations where: (a) only one molecule of a first polypeptide is linked to only one molecule of a second polypeptide; (b) only one molecule of a first polypeptide is linked to more than one molecule of a second polypeptide; (c) more than one molecule of a first polypeptide is linked to only one molecule of a second polypeptide; and (d) more than one molecule of a first polypeptide is linked to more than one molecule of a second polypeptide. In certain embodiments, when a linked molecule comprises more than one molecule of a first polypeptide and only one molecule of a second polypeptide, all or fewer than all of the molecules of the first polypeptide may be covalently or noncovalently linked to the second polypeptide. In certain embodiments, when a linked molecule comprises more than one molecule of a first polypeptide, one or more molecules of the first polypeptide may be covalently or noncovalently linked to other molecules of the first polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0225">As used herein, a &#x201c;flexible linker&#x201d; refers to any linker that is not predicted, according to its chemical structure, to be fixed in three-dimensional space. One skilled in the art can predict whether a particular linker is flexible in its intended context. In certain embodiments, a peptide linker comprising 3 or more amino acids is a flexible linker.</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0236">In certain embodiments, a conservative substitution may involve replacing a member of one residue type with a member of the same residue type. As a non-limiting example, in certain embodiments, a conservative substitution may involve replacing an acidic residue, such as D, with a different acidic residue, such as E. In certain embodiments, a non-conservative substitution may involve replacing a member of one residue type with a member of a different residue type. As a non-limiting example, in certain embodiments, a non-conservative substitution may involve replacing an acidic residue, such as D, with a basic residue, such as K. In certain embodiments, a cysteine residue is substituted with another amino acid residue to prevent disulfide bond formation with that position in the polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0237">In making conservative or non-conservative substitutions, according to certain embodiments, the hydropathic index of amino acids may be considered. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. The hydropathic indices of the 20 naturally-occurring amino acids are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (&#x2212;0.4); threonine (&#x2212;0.7); serine (&#x2212;0.8); tryptophan (&#x2212;0.9); tyrosine (&#x2212;1.3); proline (&#x2212;1.6); histidine (&#x2212;3.2); glutamate (&#x2212;3.5); glutamine (&#x2212;3.5); aspartate (&#x2212;3.5); asparagine (&#x2212;3.5); lysine (&#x2212;3.9); and arginine (&#x2212;4.5).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0238">The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is understood in the art. Kyte et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>157:105-131 (1982). It is known in certain instances that certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic index, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within &#xb1;2 is included. In certain embodiments, those which are within &#xb1;1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within &#xb1;0.5 are included.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0239">It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity, particularly where the biologically functional protein or peptide thereby created is intended for use in immunological embodiments, as in the present case. In certain embodiments, the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with its immunogenicity and antigenicity, i.e., with a biological property of the polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0240">The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0&#xb1;1); glutamate (+3.0&#xb1;1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (&#x2212;0.4); proline (&#x2212;0.5&#xb1;1); alanine (&#x2212;0.5); histidine (&#x2212;0.5); cysteine (&#x2212;1.0); methionine (&#x2212;1.3); valine (&#x2212;1.5); leucine (&#x2212;1.8); isoleucine (&#x2212;1.8); tyrosine (&#x2212;2.3); phenylalanine (&#x2212;2.5) and tryptophan (&#x2212;3.4). In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within &#xb1;2 is included, in certain embodiments, those which are within &#xb1;1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within &#xb1;0.5 are included. In certain instances, one may also identify epitopes from primary amino acid sequences on the basis of hydrophilicity. These regions are also referred to as &#x201c;epitopic core regions.&#x201d;</p>

The direction of 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to herein as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5&#x2032; to the 5&#x2032; end of the RNA transcript are referred to herein as &#x201c;upstream sequences&#x201d;; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3&#x2032; to the 3&#x2032; end of the RNA transcript are referred to herein as &#x201c;downstream sequences.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0244">In certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. Those non-naturally occurring amino acid residues include, but are not limited to, peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0245">A skilled artisan will be able to determine suitable substitution variants of a reference polypeptide as set forth herein using well-known techniques. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may identify suitable areas of the molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions not believed to be important for activity. In certain embodiments, one can identify residues and portions of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides. In certain embodiments, even areas that may be important for biological activity, including, but not limited to, the CDRs of an antibody, or that may be important for structure may be subject to conservative amino acid substitutions without destroying the biological activity or without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0246">Additionally, in certain embodiments, one skilled in the art can review structure-function studies identifying residues in similar polypeptides that are important for activity and/or structure. In view of such a comparison, in certain embodiments, one can predict the importance of amino acid residues in a polypeptide that correspond to amino acid residues which are important for activity or structure in similar polypeptides. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such predicted important amino acid residues.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0247">In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art can also analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar polypeptides. In view of such information, one skilled in the art may predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein, since such residues may be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover, in certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. In certain embodiments, the variants can then be screened using activity assays known to those skilled in the art. For example, in certain embodiments, the variants can be screened for their ability to bind to TR-2. In certain embodiments, such variants could be used to gather information about suitable variants. For example, in certain embodiments, if one discovered that a change to a particular amino acid residue resulted in destroyed, undesirably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a change may be avoided. In other words, based on information gathered from such routine experiments, one skilled in the art can readily determine the amino acids where further substitutions should be avoided, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0248">A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See Moult J., <i>Curr. Op. in Biotech., </i>7(4):422-427 (1996), Chou et al., <i>Biochemistry, </i>13(2):222-245 (1974); Chou et al., <i>Biochemistry, </i>113(2):211-222 (1974); Chou et al., <i>Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol., </i>47:45-148 (1978); Chou et al., <i>Ann. Rev. Biochem., </i>47:251-276 and Chou et al., <i>Biophys. J., </i>26:367-384 (1979). Moreover, computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins which have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40% often have similar structural topologies. The recent growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the potential number of folds within a polypeptide's or protein's structure. See Holm et al., <i>Nucl. Acid. Res., </i>27(1):244-247 (1999). It has been suggested that there are a limited number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate. See, e.g., Brenner et al., <i>Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., </i>7(3):369-376 (1997).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0249">Additional exemplary methods of predicting secondary structure include, but are not limited to, &#x201c;threading&#x201d; (Jones, D., <i>Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol., </i>7(3):377-87 (1997); Sippl et al., <i>Structure, </i>4(1):15-19 (1996)), &#x201c;profile analysis&#x201d; (Bowie et al., <i>Science, </i>253:164-170 (1991); Gribskov et al., <i>Meth.

<p id="p-0121" num="0250">In certain embodiments, the identity and similarity of related polypeptides can be readily calculated by known methods. Such methods include, but are not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York (1988); Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York (1993); Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part 1, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H.

Stockton Press, New York (1991); and Carillo et al., <i>SIAMJ. Applied Math., </i>48:1073 (1988). In certain embodiments, polypeptides have amino acid sequences that are about 90 percent, or about 95 percent, or about 96 percent, or about 97 percent, or about 98 percent, or about 99 percent identical to amino acid sequences shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0251">In certain embodiments, methods to determine identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. In certain embodiments, certain methods to determine identity are described in publicly available computer programs. Certain computer program methods to determine identity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package, including GAP (Devereux et al., <i>Nucl. Acid. Res., </i>12:387 (1984); Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis., BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (Altschul et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>215:403-410 (1990)). The BLASTX program is publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and other sources (<i>BLAST Manual</i>, Altschul et al. NCB/NLM/NIH Bethesda, Md. 20894; Altschul et al., supra (1990)). In certain embodiments, the Smith Waterman algorithm, which is known in the art, may also be used to determine identity.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0252">Certain alignment schemes for aligning two amino acid sequences may result in the matching of only a short region of the two sequences, and this small aligned region may have very high sequence identity even though there is no significant relationship between the two full-length sequences. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the selected alignment method (GAP program) will result in an alignment that spans at least 50 contiguous amino acids of the target polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0253">For example, using the computer algorithm GAP (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), two polypeptides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acids (the &#x201c;matched span&#x201d;, as determined by the algorithm). In certain embodiments, a gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3&#xd7; the average diagonal; the &#x201c;average diagonal&#x201d; is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the &#x201c;diagonal&#x201d; is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 1/10 times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. In certain embodiments, a standard comparison matrix is also used by the algorithm. See, e.g., Dayhoff et al., <i>Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, </i>5(3)(1978) for the PAM 250 comparison matrix; Henikoff et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

<p id="p-0127" num="0261">According to certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and/or (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties on such polypeptides. According to certain embodiments, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (in certain embodiments, in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0262">In certain embodiments, a conservative amino acid substitution typically may not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described, e.g., in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W.H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); Introduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et al. Nature 354:105 (1991).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0263">The term &#x201c;polypeptide fragment&#x201d; as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion.

It will be appreciated that in certain embodiments, fragments are at least 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 20, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 amino acids long.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0264">Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed &#x201c;peptide mimetics&#x201d; or &#x201c;peptidomimetics.&#x201d; Fauchere, <i>J. Adv. Drug Res. </i>15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger TINS p. 392 (1985); and Evans et al. <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>30:1229 (1987). Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce a similar therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as a human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from: &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>NH&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>S&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH&#x2550;CH-(cis and trans), &#x2014;COCH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH(OH)CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, and &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>SO&#x2014;, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used in certain embodiments to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch <i>Ann. Rev. Biochem. </i>61:387 (1992)); for example, and not limitation, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0303">The term &#x201c;pharmaceutical agent or drug&#x201d; as used herein refers to a chemical compound or composition capable of inducing a desired therapeutic effect when properly administered to a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0304">The term &#x201c;modulator,&#x201d; as used herein, is a compound that changes or alters the activity or function of a molecule. For example, a modulator may cause an increase or decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity or function of a molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the modulator. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an inhibitor, which decreases the magnitude of at least one activity or function of a molecule.

<p id="p-0165" num="0308">In certain embodiments, chimeric antibodies that comprise at least a portion of a human sequence and another species' sequence are provided. In certain embodiments, such a chimeric antibody may result in a reduced immune response in a host than an antibody without that host's antibody sequences. For example, in certain instances, an animal of interest may be used as a model for a particular human disease. To study the effect of an antibody on that disease in the animal host, one could use an antibody from a different species. But, in certain instances, such antibodies from another species, may elicit an immune response to the antibodies themselves in the host animal, thus impeding evaluation of these antibodies. In certain embodiments, replacing part of the amino acid sequence of an anti-TR-2 antibody with antibody amino acid sequence from the host animal may decrease the magnitude of the host animal's anti-antibody response.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0309">In certain embodiments, a chimeric antibody comprises a heavy chain and a light chain, wherein the variable regions of the light chain and the heavy chain are from a first species and the constant regions of the light chain and the heavy chain are from a second species. In certain embodiments, the antibody heavy chain constant region is an antibody heavy chain constant region of a species other than human. In certain embodiments, the antibody light chain constant region is an antibody light chain constant region of a species other than human. In certain embodiments, the antibody heavy chain constant region is a human antibody heavy chain constant region, and the antibody heavy chain variable region is an antibody heavy chain variable region of a species other than human. In certain embodiments, the antibody light chain constant region is a human antibody light chain constant region, and the antibody light chain variable region is an antibody light chain variable region of a species other than human.

Exemplary antibody variable regions include, but are not limited to, a human antibody variable region, a mouse antibody variable region, a pig antibody variable region, a guinea pig antibody variable region, a cynomolgus monkey antibody variable region, and a rabbit antibody variable region. In certain embodiments, the framework regions of the variable region in the heavy chain and light chain may be replaced with framework regions derived from other antibody sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0310">Certain exemplary chimeric antibodies may be produced by methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide of the first species encoding the heavy chain variable region and the polynucleotide of the second species encoding the heavy chain constant region can be fused. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide of the first species encoding the light chain variable region and the nucleotide sequence of the second species encoding the light chain constant region can be fused. In certain embodiments, these fused nucleotide sequences can be introduced into a cell either in a single expression vector (e.g., a plasmid) or in multiple expression vectors. In certain embodiments, a cell comprising at least one expression vector may be used to make polypeptide. In certain embodiments, these fused nucleotide sequences can be introduced into a cell either in separate expression vectors or in a single expression vector. In certain embodiments, the host cell expresses both the heavy chain and the light chain, which combine to produce an antibody. In certain embodiments, a cell comprising at least one expression vector may be used to make an antibody. Exemplary methods for producing and expressing antibodies are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0311">In certain embodiments, conservative modifications to the heavy and light chains of an anti-TR-2 antibody (and corresponding modifications to the encoding nucleotides) will produce antibodies having functional and chemical characteristics similar to those of the original antibody. In contrast, in certain embodiments, substantial modifications in the functional and/or chemical characteristics of an anti-TR-2 antibody may be accomplished by selecting substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the heavy and light chains that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the molecular backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0312">Certain desired amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or non-conservative) can be determined by those skilled in the art at the time such substitutions are desired. In certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions can be used to identify important residues of the anti-TR-2 antibodies, such as those which may increase or decrease the affinity of the antibodies to TR-2 or the effector function of the antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0313">In certain embodiments, the effects of an anti-TR-2 antibody may be evaluated by measuring a reduction in the amount of symptoms of the disease. In certain embodiments, the disease of interest may be caused by a pathogen. In certain embodiments, a disease may be established in an animal host by other methods including introduction of a substance (such as a carcinogen) and genetic manipulation. In certain embodiments, effects may be evaluated by detecting one or more adverse events in the animal host. The term &#x201c;adverse event&#x201d; includes, but is not limited to, an adverse reaction in an animal host that receives an antibody that is not present in an animal host that does not receive the antibody. In certain embodiments, adverse events include, but are not limited to, a fever, an immune response to an antibody, inflammation, and/or death of the animal host.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0314">Various antibodies specific to an antigen may be produced in a number of ways. In certain embodiments, an antigen containing an epitope of interest may be introduced into an animal host (e.g., a mouse), thus producing antibodies specific to that epitope. In certain instances, antibodies specific to an epitope of interest may be obtained from biological samples taken from hosts that were naturally exposed to the epitope. In certain instances, introduction of human immunoglobulin (Ig) loci into mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated offers the opportunity to obtain human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs).</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Naturally Occurring Antibody Structure</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0315">Naturally occurring antibody structural units typically comprise a tetramer. Each such tetramer typically is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one full-length &#x201c;light&#x201d; chain (in certain embodiments, about 25 kDa) and one full-length &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; chain (in certain embodiments, about 50-70 kDa). The term &#x201c;heavy chain&#x201d; includes any polypeptide having sufficient variable region sequence to confer specificity for a particular antigen. A full-length heavy chain includes a variable region domain, V<sub>H</sub>, and three constant region domains, C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2, and C<sub>H</sub>3. The V<sub>H </sub>domain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide, and the C<sub>H</sub>3 domain is at the carboxy-terminus. The term &#x201c;heavy chain&#x201d;, as used herein, encompasses a full-length antibody heavy chain and fragments thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0316">The term &#x201c;light chain&#x201d; includes any polypeptide having sufficient variable region sequence to confer specificity for a particular antigen. A full-length light chain includes a variable region domain, V<sub>L</sub>, and a constant region domain, C<sub>L</sub>. Like the heavy chain, the variable region domain of the light chain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide. The term &#x201c;light chain&#x201d;, as used herein, encompasses a full-length light chain and fragments thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0317">The amino-terminal portion of each chain typically includes a variable region (V<sub>H </sub>in the heavy chain and V<sub>L </sub>in the light chain) of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids that typically is responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain typically defines a constant region (C<sub>H </sub>domains in the heavy chain and C<sub>L </sub>in the light chain) that may be responsible for effector function. Antibody effector functions include activation of complement and stimulation of opsonophagocytosis. Human light chains are typically classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are typically classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. IgG has several subclasses, including, but not limited to, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgM has subclasses including, but not limited to, IgM1 and IgM2. IgA is similarly subdivided into subclasses including, but not limited to, IgA1 and IgA2. Within full-length light and heavy chains, typically, the variable and constant regions are joined by a &#x201c;J&#x201d; region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a &#x201c;D&#x201d; region of about 10 more amino acids. See, e.g., Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair typically form the antigen binding site.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0318">The variable regions typically exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the heavy and light chains of each pair typically are aligned by the framework regions, which may enable binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chain variable regions typically comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is typically in accordance with the definitions of Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991)), or Chothia &#x26; Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987); Chothia et al. Nature 342:878-883 (1989).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0319">As discussed above, there are several types of antibody fragments. A Fab fragment is comprised of one light chain and the C<sub>H</sub>1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule. A Fab&#x2032; fragment contains one light chain and one heavy chain that contains more of the constant region, between the C<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>H</sub>2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between two heavy chains to form a F(ab&#x2032;)2 molecule. A Fab fragment is similar to a F(ab&#x2032;)2 molecule, except the constant region in the heavy chains of the molecule extends to the end of the C<sub>H</sub>2 domain. The Fv region comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions. Single-chain antibodies are Fv molecules in which the heavy and light chain variable regions have been connected by a flexible linker to form a single polypeptide chain which forms an antigen-binding region. Exemplary single chain antibodies are discussed in detail, e.g., in WO 88/01649 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,260,203. A Fc fragment contains the C<sub>H</sub>2 and C<sub>H</sub>3 domains of the heavy chain and contains more of the constant region, between the C<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>H</sub>2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between two heavy chains.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0320">In certain embodiments, functional domains, C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2, C<sub>H</sub>3, and intervening sequences can be shuffled to create a different antibody constant region. For example, in certain embodiments, such hybrid constant regions can be optimized for half-life in serum, for assembly and folding of the antibody tetramer, and/or for improved effector function. In certain embodiments, modified antibody constant regions may be produced by introducing single point mutations into the amino acid sequence of the constant region and testing the resulting antibody for improved qualities, e.g., one or more of those listed above.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0321">In certain embodiments, an antibody of one isotype is converted to a different isotype by isotype switching without losing its specificity for a particular target molecule. Methods of isotype switching include, but are not limited to, direct recombinant techniques (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397) and cell-cell fusion techniques (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,771), among others. In certain embodiments, an antibody can be converted from one subclass to another subclass using techniques described above or otherwise known in the art without losing its specificity for a particular target molecule, including, but not limited to, conversion from an IgG2 subclass to an IgG1, IgG3, or IgG4 subclass.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Bispecific or Bifunctional Antibodies</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0322">A bispecific or bifunctional antibody typically is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies may be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab&#x2032; fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai &#x26; Lachmann <i>Clin. Exp. Immunol. </i>79: 315-321 (1990), Kostelny et al. <i>J. Immunol. </i>148:1547-1553 (1992).</p>

In certain embodiments, sequences encoding particular antibodies, including chimeric antibodies, can be used for transformation of a suitable mammalian host cell. According to certain embodiments, transformation can be by any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus (or into a viral vector) and transducing a host cell with the virus or by transfecting a vector using procedures known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat.

In certain embodiments, a composition comprising an antibody, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, may be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (<i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences</i>, supra) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further, in certain embodiments, a composition comprising an antibody, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipient solutions (e.g., sucrose) as diluents.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0365">In certain embodiments, anti-TR-2 antibodies are administered in the form of a physiologically acceptable composition comprising purified recombinant protein in conjunction with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents. In certain embodiments, such carriers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. In certain embodiments, preparing such compositions may involve combining the anti-TR-2 antibodies with buffers, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, low molecular weight polypeptides (such as those having fewer than 10 amino acids), proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose or dextrins, chelating agents such as EDTA, glutathione and/or other stabilizers, and excipients. In certain embodiments, appropriate dosages are determined in standard dosing trials, and may vary according to the chosen route of administration. In certain embodiments, in accordance with appropriate industry standards, preservatives may also be added, which include, but are not limited to, benzyl alcohol. In certain embodiments, the amount and frequency of administration may be determined based on such factors as the nature and severity of the disease being treated, the desired response, the age and condition of the patient, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0366">In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions can be selected for parenteral delivery. The preparation of certain such pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is within the skill of the art.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0367">In certain embodiments, the formulation components are present in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. In certain embodiments, buffers are used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range of from about 5 to about 8.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0368">In certain embodiments, when parenteral administration is contemplated, a therapeutic composition may be in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired antibody, with or without additional therapeutic agents, in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. In certain embodiments, a vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which the antibody, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, is formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. In certain embodiments, the preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (such as polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid), beads, or liposomes, that may provide for the controlled or sustained release of the product which may then be delivered via a depot injection. In certain embodiments, hyaluronic acid may also be used, and may have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. In certain embodiments, implantable drug delivery devices may be used to introduce the desired molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0369">In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition may be formulated for inhalation. In certain embodiments, an antibody, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, may be formulated as a dry powder for inhalation. In certain embodiments, an inhalation solution comprising an antibody, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, may be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In certain embodiments, solutions may be nebulized. Pulmonary administration is further described in PCT publication no. WO94/20069, which describes pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0370">In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that formulations may be administered orally. In certain embodiments, an antibody, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, that is administered in this fashion may be formulated with or without those carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. In certain embodiments, a capsule may be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. In certain embodiments, at least one additional agent can be included to facilitate absorption of the antibody and/or any additional therapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and/or binders may also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0371">In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition may involve an effective quantity of antibodies, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, in a mixture with non-toxic excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. In certain embodiments, by dissolving the tablets in sterile water, or another appropriate vehicle, solutions may be prepared in unit-dose form. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium phosphate; and binding agents, such as starch, gelatin, and acacia; and lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and talc.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0372">Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art, including formulations involving antibodies, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, in sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations. In certain exemplary sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations include, but are not limited to, liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles, porous beads, and depot injections. Certain exemplary techniques for preparing certain formulations are known to those skilled in the art. See for example, PCT publication no. WO93/15722, which describes the controlled release of porous polymeric microparticles for the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. In certain embodiments, sustained-release preparations may include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices include, but are not limited to, polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919 and EP 058,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., <i>Biopolymers, </i>22:547-556 (1983)), poly (2 -hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et al., <i>J. Biomed. Mater. Res., </i>15:167-277 (1981) and Langer, <i>Chem. Tech., </i>12:98-105 (1982)), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra), and poly-D(&#x2212;)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988). In certain embodiments, sustained release compositions may also include liposomes, which can be prepared, in certain embodiments, by any of several methods known in the art. See e.g., Eppstein et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>82:3688-3692 (1985); EP 036,676; EP 088,046 and EP 143,949.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0373">In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration is sterile. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration is made sterile by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. In certain embodiments, where the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using sterile filtration membranes may be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. In certain embodiments, the composition for parenteral administration may be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. In certain embodiments, parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0374">In certain embodiments, after the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it may be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. In certain embodiments, such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g., a lyophilized form) that is reconstituted prior to administration.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0375">In certain embodiments, kits for producing a single-dose administration unit are provided. In certain embodiments, the kits may each contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. In certain embodiments, kits containing single and/or multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes) are included.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0376">In certain embodiments, the effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment, according to certain embodiments, will thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which the antibody, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and/or condition (the age and general health) of the patient. In certain embodiments, the clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. In certain embodiments, a typical dosage may range from about 0.1 &#x3bc;g/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In certain embodiments, the dosage may range from 0.1 &#x3bc;g/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 1 &#x3bc;g/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 &#x3bc;g/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 0.1 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0377">In certain embodiments, the frequency of dosing will take into account the pharmacokinetic parameters of the antibody and/or any additional therapeutic agents in the formulation used. In certain embodiments, a clinician will administer the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. In certain embodiments, the composition may therefore be administered as a single dose, or as two or more doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Certain methods of further refining the appropriate dosage are within the skill in the art. In certain embodiments, appropriate dosages may be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0378">In certain embodiments, the route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g. orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intra-ocular, intraarterial, intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained release systems or by implantation devices. In certain embodiments, the compositions may be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0379">As discussed above, in various embodiments, any efficacious route of administration may be used to administer anti-TR-2 antibodies. If injected, in certain embodiments, anti-TR-2 antibodies may be administered, for example, via intra-articular, intravenous, intramuscular, intralesional, intraperitoneal, intracranial, intranasal, inhalation or subcutaneous routes by bolus injection or by continuous infusion. Exemplary methods of administration include, but are not limited to, sustained release from implants, aerosol inhalation, eyedrops, oral preparations, including pills, syrups, lozenges, and chewing gum, and topical preparations such as lotions, gels, sprays, ointments, and other suitable techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0380">In certain embodiments, administration by inhalation is beneficial when treating diseases associated with pulmonary disorders. In certain embodiments, anti-TR-2 antibodies may be administered by implanting cultured cells that express the antibodies. In certain embodiments, the patient's own cells are induced to produce by transfection in vivo or ex vivo with one or more vectors that encode an anti-TR-2 antibody. In certain embodiments, this vector can be introduced into the patient's cells, for example, by injecting naked DNA or liposome-encapsulated DNA that encodes an anti-TR-2 antibody, or by other methods of transfection. When anti-TR-2 antibodies are administered in combination with one or more other biologically active compounds, in certain embodiments, these may be administered by the same or by different routes, and may be administered together, separately, or sequentially.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0381">In certain embodiments, the composition may be administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge or another appropriate material onto which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. In certain embodiments, where an implantation device is used, the device may be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule may be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0382">In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to use a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, in an ex vivo manner. In such embodiments, cells, tissues and/or organs that have been removed from the patient are exposed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody, with or without at least one additional therapeutic agent, after which the cells, tissues and/or organs are subsequently implanted back into the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0383">In certain embodiments, an antibody and any additional therapeutic agents can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to express and secrete the polypeptides. In certain embodiments, such cells may be animal or human cells, and may be autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. In certain embodiments, the cells may be immortalized. In certain embodiments, in order to decrease the chance of an immunological response, the cells may be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. In certain embodiments, the encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product(s) but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Production of Certain Human Monoclonal Antibodies</heading>
<p id="p-0241" num="0384">Human anti-TR-2 antibodies were produced in one of two ways. Transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulin genes (Xenomouse&#xae;) were exposed to human TR-2. Certain human anti-TR-2 monoclonal antibodies were produced from those mice using hybridoma-techniques. Certain other human anti-TR-2 monoclonal antibodies were produced from those mice using XenoMax technology, which incorporates the selected lymphocyte antibody method (&#x201c;SLAM&#x201d;) technique (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,627,052; and Babcook et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:7843-7848 (1996)).</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0385">The methodology used to produce human anti-TR-2 monoclonal antibodies in transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulin genes was as follows. Five groups of mice were immunized with recombinant human TR-2 with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (TR-2-His) (mature amino acid sequence ALITQQDLAPQQRAAPQQKRSSPSEGLCPPGHHISEDGRDCISCKY GQDYSTHWNDLLFCLRCTRCDSGEVELSPCTTTRNTVCQCEEGTFREEDS PEMCRKCRTGCPRGMVKVGDCTPWSDIECVHKESGTKHSGEAPAVEETVT SSPGTPASRSGSSHHHHHH (SEQ ID NO: 140)) (Genbank Reference Number NM-003842), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The mice in group one, group three, group four, and group five were engineered to produce antibodies of the IgG2 isotype (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The mice in group two were engineered to produce antibodies of the IgG4 isotype (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Group one included 7 mice, group two included 8 mice, group three included 8 mice, group four included 10 mice, and group five included 5 mice. The mice in group one, group two, and group three were immunized by injection of TR-2-His into the footpad (10 &#x3bc;g per injection), while the mice in group four and group five were immunized intraperitoneally (10 &#x3bc;g per injection) with TR-2-His. On day 0, 10 &#x3bc;g antigen was administered by the described route. At specified intervals, booster injections were administered to the mice. Group one mice had nine booster injections, at days 5, 11, 14, 18, 24, 28, 34, 42, and 46. Group two and group three mice had 7 booster injections; those for group 2 were at days 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 24, and 27, and those for group three were at days 5, 8, 15, 21, 26, 30, and 33. Group four and group five mice had 5 booster injections, at days 14, 28, 42, 56, and 72. Each first injection and each booster injection contained 10 &#x3bc;g TR-2-His with an adjuvant, either Titermax Gold (Groups one, two, and three), alum gel (groups one, two, and three), Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) (groups four and five), Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) (groups four and five), or Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) (groups one, two, three, four, and five) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Mice were bled after three injections (groups four and five), after four injections (groups one, two, and three), after six injections (groups one and two), and after ten injections (group one). The reactivity of each bleed to TR-2-His was assessed by ELISA, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0386">The ELISA assay was performed as follows. Multiwell plates were coated with soluble TR-2-His (0.5 &#x3bc;g/mL) by passive adsorption overnight at 4&#xb0; C. The coated wells were washed and blocked for 30 minutes with milk. Ten &#x3bc;L of each mouse serum was combined with 40 &#x3bc;L milk and incubated in the wells of different plates for 1 hour, 1.25 hours, or 2 hours. The plates were washed five times with water. The plates were then incubated with a goat anti-human IgG Fc-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Pierce) at a final concentration of 1 &#x3bc;g/mL for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed five times with water. The plates were incubated with K blue substrate (Neogen) for 30 minutes. Negative controls included blank wells lacking TR-2-His and wells including TR-2-His but incubated with naive G2 sera expected to lack anti-TR-2 antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0387">The methodologies used to produce human anti-TR-2 monoclonal antibodies were as follows. For XenoMax technology, CD19 + B cells were isolated from the hyperimmune transgenic mice that were harvested on day 37 (mouse M712-7 from group three), or day 76 (mouse M564-1 from group four, and mice M564-3, M564-5, and M563-5 from group five after the initiation of immunization. The B cells were cultured for 1 week to allow their expansion and consequent differentiation into plasma cells. The supernatants containing the secreted antibody was saved for further analysis and the plasma cells in each well were frozen at &#x2212;80 degrees celcius in media containing 10 % DMSO and 90 % FCS. For hybridoma technology, the cells from the remaining hyperimmune transgenic mice were harvested on day 31, 37 or 46 for further analysis as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0388">For XenoMax technology, supernates from the B cell cultures were screened by ELISA for the presence of antibodies to TR-2. Anti-TR-2 antibodies were detected by assessing binding to immobilized TR-2-His using an anti-human IgG antibody detection reagent as follows. Plates were coated with soluble TR-2-His (0.5 &#x3bc;g/ml) by passive adsorption overnight at 4&#xb0; C. After washing the plates five times with water and blocking the wells in the plates with milk for 30 minutes, 10 &#x3bc;L cell culture supernate from each individual hybridoma was combined with 40 &#x3bc;L milk and incubated in the wells of different plates for 1 hour, 1.25 hours, or 2 hours. The plates were washed five times with water, and incubated with a goat anti-human IgG Fc-specific horseradish peroxidase (Pierce)-conjugated antibody at a final concentration of 1 &#x3bc;g/mL for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing the plates five times with water, the plates were incubated with K blue substrate (Neogen) for 30 minutes. Negative controls included blank wells lacking TR-2-His and wells using naive G2 sera expected to lack anti-TR-2 antibodies. Positive samples were screened by ELISA a second time against TR-2-His to confirm the identity of cells producing antibodies specific for TR-2.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0389">The antibodies reactive with TR-2, identified above, were screened for their ability to induce apoptosis of WM-266 melanoma cells (ATCC Cat. No. CRL-1676) using an apoptosis assay. WM-266 cells were cultured in a microtiter plate at a density of 4500 cells/well in normal culture medium as recommended by ATCC overnight. For B cell cultures, 20 &#x3bc;L of antigen-specific B cell culture supernatant or control B cell culture supernatant was added to 180 &#x3bc;L of apoptosis medium mixture (cell culture medium containing 1 &#x3bc;g/mL cycloheximide (CHX) and 0.5 % fetal calf serum (&#x201c;FCS&#x201d;)). The culture media from the WM-266 cells was removed and the antibody-apoptosis medium mixture was added to the cells one row at a time. The cells were incubated with the antibody-apoptosis medium for 20 hours to allow apoptosis to occur. The DNA-binding fluorescent dyes propidium iodide (Sigma) and Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) were added to each well at a final concentration of 0.5 &#x3bc;g/mL and 2.5 &#x3bc;g/mL, respectively. Hoechst 33342 is membrane-permeable, and thus labels both live and dead cells; propidium iodide is not membrane-permeable, and thus labels only dead cells. After one hour at 37&#xb0; C., images of each well were captured and analyzed for total number of cells (by assessing the amount of Hoechst label) and total number of dead cells (by assessing the amount of propidium iodide label). The percent apoptosis was determined as (propidium iodide-positive cells/Hoechst-positive cells)&#xd7;100.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0390">For XenoMax technology, the antibodies from several wells that displayed the best induction of apoptosis were selected for rescue using the haemolytic plaque assay. TR-2-His was biotinylated and coated onto streptavidin-coated sheep red blood cells. Plasma cells corresponding to antigen-specific wells were thawed and incubated with the antigen-coated red blood cells in the presence of complement and guinea pig anti-human IgG enhancing serum. Plasma cells producing antibodies against TR-2-His caused the sheep red blood cells around them to lyse and thus allowed the identification of antigen-specific plasma cells in the mixture. Those plasma cells were isolated by micromanipulation of single cells from the mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0391">After isolation of the desired single plasma cells, mRNA was extracted from those cells. The mRNAs encoding the heavy and light chain variable sequences were converted to cDNA and amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR using degenerate antisense primers specific for the leader sequences and the constant regions of human IgG2 and human kappa mRNA The primer sequences are provided in Table 2 below:</p>

<p id="p-0250" num="0393">The primers introduced the following restriction sites at the 5&#x2032; end (BgIII) and the 3&#x2032; end (Xba1) of the heavy chain cDNA. Similarly, the primers introduced the following restriction sites at the 5&#x2032; end (BgIII) and the 3&#x2032; end (NheI) of the kappa chain cDNA.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0394">The variable heavy chain cDNA amplicon was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes for the restriction enzyme sites that were added during the PCR reaction. The products of that digestion were cloned into each of an IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 expression vector with compatible overhangs for cloning. The IgG2 and IgG4 expression vectors were digested with BamHI and XbaI to generate compatible overhangs for sub-cloning. The IgG1 expression construct was digested with BamHI and NheI to generate compatible overhangs for sub-cloning. These vectors were generated by cloning the constant domain of human IgG1, IgG2 or IgG4 into the multiple cloning site of the vector pcDNA3.1+/Hygro (Invitrogen).</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0395">The variable light chain cDNA amplicon was also digested with appropriate restriction enzymes for the restriction enzyme sites that were added during the PCR reaction. The products of that digestion were cloned into an IgK expression vector that had been digested with BamHI and NheI to provide compatible overhangs for sub-cloning. That vector was generated by cloning the constant domain of the human IgK gene into the multiple cloning site of the vector pcDNA4.1+/Neo (Invitrogen).</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0396">The heavy chain and the light chain expression vectors were then co-lipofected into a 60 mm dish of 70 % confluent human embryonal kidney 293 cells (ATCC, Cat. No. CRL-1573). For 24 hours, the transfected cells were allowed to secrete a recombinant antibody with the identical specificity as the original plasma cell. The supernatant (3 mL) was harvested from the HEK 293 cells and the secretion of an intact antibody was demonstrated with a sandwich ELISA to specifically detect human IgG. Control plates were coated with 2 mg/mL Goat anti-human IgG H+L O/N as for binding plates. The plates were washed five times with water. Recombinant antibodies were titrated 1:2 for 7 wells from the undiluted lipofection supernatant. The plates were washed five times with dH2O. A goat anti-human IgG Fc-specific HRP-conjugated antibody was added at a final concentration of 1 &#x3bc;g/mL for 1 hour at room temperature for the secretion and the two binding assays. The plates were washed five times with dH2O. The plates were developed with the addition of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) for 30 minutes and the ELISA was stopped by the addition of 1 M phosphoric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0397">In addition to the XenoMax methodology described above, certain antibodies were obtained using hybridoma technology. Immunized mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the draining lymph nodes were harvested and pooled from each cohort. The lymphoid cells were dissociated by grinding in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (&#x201c;DMEM&#x201d;) to release the cells from the tissues. Recovered cells were suspended in DMEM. The cells were counted, and 0.9 mL DMEM per 100 million lymphocytes was added to the cell pellet to resuspend the cells gently but completely. The resuspended cells were incubated with 100 &#x3bc;L of CD90<sup>+</sup> magnetic beads per 100 million cells at 4&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes. The magnetically-labeled cell suspension (containing up to 10<sup>8 </sup>positive cells (or up to 2&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>total cells)) was loaded onto an LS<sup>+</sup> column. The column was washed with DMEM. The total effluent was collected as the CD90<sup>&#x2212;</sup>negative fraction, which was expected to contain mostly B cells.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0398">The fusion was performed by mixing washed enriched B cells from above and nonsecretory myeloma P3X63Ag*.653 cells (ATCC (CRL 1580, see, e.g., Kearney et al., J. Immunol. 123, 1979, 1548-1550)) at a ratio of 1:1. The cell mixture was gently pelleted by centrifugation at 800 &#xd7;g. After complete removal of the supernatant from the cells, the cells were treated with 2 to 4 ml of Pronase solution (CalBiochem; 0.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (&#x201c;PBS&#x201d;)) for no more than 2 minutes. Three to five mL of fetal bovine serum (&#x201c;FBS&#x201d;) was added to stop the enzyme activity and the suspension was adjusted to a 40 mL total volume using electro cell fusion solution (&#x201c;ECFS&#x201d;) (0.3 M sucrose, 0.1 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM calcium acetate). The supernatant was removed after centrifugation and the cells were resuspended in 40 mL ECFS. This wash step was repeated and the cells again were resuspended in 40 mL ECFS to a concentration of 2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0399">Electro-cell fusion was performed using a fusion generator (model ECM2001, Genetronic, Inc.). The fusion chamber size used was 2.0 mL, using the following instrument settings: alignment condition: 50 V, 50 seconds; membrane breaking at 3000 V, 30 microseconds; post-fusion holding time: 3 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0400">After electro-cell fusion took place, the cell suspensions were carefully removed from the fusion chamber under sterile conditions and transferred into a sterile tube containing the same volume of hybridoma culture medium, containing DMEM, (JRH Biosciences), 15 % FBS (Hyclone), supplemented with L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, OPI (oxaloacetate, pyruvate, bovine insulin), and IL-6 (Boehringer Mannheim). The cells were incubated for 15 to 30 minutes at 37&#xb0; C., and then centrifuged at 400 &#xd7;g (1000 rpm) for 5 minutes. The cells were gently resuspended in a small volume of hybridoma selection medium (hybridoma culture medium supplemented with 0.5 &#xd7; hyaluronic acid (Sigma)). The total volume was adjusted appropriately with more hybridoma selection medium based on a final plating volume of 5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>B cells total per 96-well plate and 200 &#x3bc;L per well. The cells were mixed gently, pipetted into 96-well plates, and allowed to grow. On day 7 or 10, one-half the medium was removed, and the cells were re-fed with fresh hybridoma selection medium.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0401">After 14 days of culture, hybridoma supernatants were screened for TR2-specific monoclonal antibodies by ELISA. In the Primary screen, the ELISA plates (Fisher, Cat. No. 12-565-136) were coated with 50 &#x3bc;L/well of TR2 protein (2 &#x3bc;g/mL) in Coating Buffer (0.1 M Carbonate Buffer, pH 9.6, NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>8.4 g/L), then incubated at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. After incubation, the plates were washed with Washing Buffer (0.05 % Tween 20 in PBS) one time. 200 &#x3bc;L/well Blocking Buffer (0.5 % BSA, 0.1 % Tween 20, 0.01 % Thimerosal in 1 &#xd7; PBS) were added and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After incubation, the plates were washed with Washing Buffer one time. Aliquots (50 &#x3bc;L/well) of hybridoma supernatants and positive and negative controls were added, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. The positive control used throughout was serum from a hyperimmune XenoMouse animal and the negative control was serum from the KLH-immunized XenoMouse animal. After incubation, the plates were washed three times with Washing Buffer. 100 &#x3bc;L/well of detection antibody goat anti-hulgGFc-HRP (Caltag Inc., Cat. No. H10507, using concentration was 1:2000 dilution) was added and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After incubation, the plates were washed three times with Washing Buffer. 100 &#x3bc;l/well of TMB (BioFX Lab. Cat. No. TMSK-0100-01) was added, and the plates were allowed to develop for about 10 minutes (until negative control wells barely started to show color). 50 &#x3bc;l/well stop solution (TMB Stop Solution (BioFX Lab. Cat. No. STPR-0100-01) was then added and the plates were read on an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 450 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0402">The antibodies produced by the hybridomas were analyzed using the same apoptosis assay described above. WM-266 cells were cultured at a density of 4500 cells/well in normal culture medium overnight in a microtiter plate. A 2&#xd7; apoptosis medium mixture was prepared using cell culture medium without FCS and additionally including 1.8 &#x3bc;g/mL cycloheximide and 0.9 % FCS. Separate microtiter plates were used to titrate hybridoma supernatant 1:2 (in the 2&#xd7; apoptosis medium mixture) in parallel with an isotype-matched negative control anti-KLH antibody. The culture media was removed from the WM-266 cells and 100 &#x3bc;L of the antibody-apoptosis medium mixture was added to each cell-containing well, one row at a time. The microtiter plates were incubated for 20 hours to allow apoptosis to occur. The DNA-binding fluorescent dyes propidium iodide (Sigma) and Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) were added to each well at a final concentration of 0.5 &#x3bc;g/mL and 2.5 &#x3bc;g/mL respectively. After 1 hour at 37&#xb0; C., fluorescent images of each well were captured and analyzed for total number of dead cells (PI) and total number of cells (Hoechst). The percent apoptosis was determined as (PI-positive cells/Hoechst-positive cells)&#xd7;100.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0403">Seventeen different anti-TR-2 antibodies were obtained (Antibodies A-Q) using either the XenoMax or hybridoma methodologies. All of the antibodies were sequenced, and the sequences of the heavy and light chain variable regions identified (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-19</figref>). Alignments of the heavy chains and the light chains of the seventeen antibodies are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0404">Certain antibodies were examined for their ability to induce apoptosis in cells, using a similar apoptosis assay to the one described above. WM-266 melanoma cells were cultured in a microtiter plate at a density of 4500 cells/well in normal culture medium overnight. In a separate microtiter plate, the recombinant antibodies to be tested, an appropriate positive control (M413, a mouse IgG1 anti-TR-2 antibody having a heavy chain variable sequence: MEVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLKLSCAASGFTFSTYGMSWVRQTPDKRLELVA LINSQGGSTYNSDSVKGRFTISRDNARNTLYLQMSSLKSEDTAMYYCARRD YESLDSWGQGTSVTVSSG (SEQ ID NO: 141) and a light chain variable sequence: DIVLTQSPASLPVSLGQRATISCRASESVEYSGTSLIQWYRQKPGQPPKLLIY AASNVDSEVPARFSGSGSGTDFSLYIHPVEEDDIAMYFCQQSRKVPWTFGG GTKLEIKRTDAAPGLEAA (SEQ ID NO: 142)), and isotype-matched negative control antibodies (a potential anti-TR2 antibody that failed to show activity) were titrated such that the final concentration of antibody would cover a range of 0.0001 &#x3bc;g/mL to 5 &#x3bc;g/mL. The antibodies were mixed in apoptosis medium containing a final concentration of 0.9 &#x3bc;g/mL CHX and 0.45 % FCS. The culture media was removed from the WM-266 cells and the antibody-apoptosis medium mixture was added to the cells. After 20 hours of culture, the cells were stained with propidium iodide (Sigma) and Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). After 1 hour at 37&#xb0; C., an image of each well was captured and analyzed for total number of dead cells (PI) and total number of cells (Hoechst). The percent apoptosis was determined as (PI-positive cells/Hoechst-positive cells)&#xd7;100. Significant cell death was observed in cells treated with M413 or with certain anti-TR-2 antibodies described above.</p>

<p id="p-0262" num="0405">The kinetics of the binding of anti-TR-2 antibodies A to Q to TR-2 was analyzed using a Biacore&#xae; 2000 instrument. High-density goat anti-human antibody surfaces were prepared on CM-5 Biacore&#xae; chips using routine amine coupling. Each purified anti-TR-2 antibody was diluted to approximately 1 &#x3bc;g/ml in HBS-P running buffer containing 100 &#x3bc;g/ml BSA. Each anti-TR-2 antibody was captured on a separate surface using a two minute contact time and a five minute wash to stabilize the anti-TR-2 antibody surface on the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0406">To analyze the kinetics of TR-2 binding to each individual anti-TR-2 antibody, 226 nM recombinant human TR-2-His (described in Example 1) was kinetically injected over each anti-TR-2 surface for one minute (using kinject) at 25&#xb0; C., followed by a five minute dissociation period. The baseline drift resulting from a buffer injection lacking TR-2 over the anti-TR-2 antibody surface was subtracted from the observed binding on each of the other surfaces. Additionally, the data for TR-2 binding to anti-TR-2 antibody were normalized for the amount of monoclonal antibody captured on each surface. Each data set was fit globally to a 1:1 interaction model to determine binding kinetics. The k<sub>a</sub>, k<sub>d</sub>, and K<sub>d </sub>values obtained for each antibody are shown in Table 3.</p>

<p id="p-0265" num="0408">Cell killing assays were performed with certain human anti-TR-2 antibodies described in Example 2 to determine the degree to which each antibody triggered apoptosis and cell death. Certain human anti-TR-2 antibodies, as well as mouse anti-TR-2 antibodies M412 and M413, were immobilized in separate wells of 96-well Protein G-coated plates (reactin-bind Protein G coated plates, Pierce Cat. No. 15131). M412 is a mouse IgG1 anti-TR-2 antibody having a heavy chain variable sequence: KVQLQQSGTELVKPGASVKLSCKASGYTFTEYIIHWVKQRSGQGLEWIGWF YPGSGYIKYNEKFKDKATMTADKSSSTVYMELSRLTSEDSAVYFCTRHEED GYYAAYWGQGTLVTVSA (SEQ ID NO: 143) and a light chain variable sequence: DIVMTQSHKFMSTSVGDRVSITCKASQDVSSAVAWYQQKPGQSPKLLIYWA STRHTGVPDRFTGSGSGTDYTLTISSVQAEDLALYYCQQHYSTPYTFGGGT KLEIKR (SEQ ID NO: 144). M413 is a mouse IgG1 anti-TR-2 antibody as described above in Example 1. Each antibody was added at a concentration of 50 &#x3bc;g/ml to a first well, and serially diluted 1:3&#xd7; in each of seven additional wells. Each antibody dilution was performed in triplicate. Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 4&#xb0; C. prior to use. Following the washing of each well with culture media (RPMI plus 10 % FBS), one of four different cell lines was plated onto each immobilized antibody, at a density of 50,000 cells per well in a total volume of 200 &#x3bc;L. The cell lines tested were COLO 205 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma), MDA-231 cells (human breast cancer), WM35 cells (human melanoma), and WM793 cells (human melanoma). Cells were incubated at 37&#xb0; C./6 % CO<sub>2 </sub>for 24 hours, followed by a 6 hour incubation with <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine. The percentage of viable cells was assessed by determining the level of <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation in the treated cells relative to the level of <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation into the untreated cells. The ED<sub>50 </sub>of each antibody was derived from the cell viability titration curve by determining the concentration of antibody that reduced the viability of treated cells by 50 % relative to untreated cells. The ED<sub>50 </sub>of the human antibodies for COLO 205 cells ranged from 0 &#x3bc;g/ml to 3.25 &#x3bc;g/ml. The mouse antibodies M412 and M413 had ED<sub>50</sub>s of 1.85 &#x3bc;g/ml and 0.07 &#x3bc;g/ml, respectively, for those cells. The ED<sub>50 </sub>of the human antibodies for MDA-231 cells ranged from 0.05 &#x3bc;g/ml to 0.5 &#x3bc;g/ml. The mouse antibodies M412 and M413 had ED<sub>50</sub>s of 0.6 &#x3bc;g/ml and 0.07 &#x3bc;g/ml, respectively, for those cells. The ED<sub>50 </sub>of the human antibodies for WM35 cells ranged from 0.1 &#x3bc;g/ml to 0.6 &#x3bc;g/ml. The mouse antibodies M412 and M413 had ED<sub>50</sub>s of 1.85 &#x3bc;g/ml and 0.07 &#x3bc;g/ml, respectively, for those cells. The ED<sub>50 </sub>of the human antibodies for WM793 cells ranged from 0.02 &#x3bc;g/ml to 0.2 &#x3bc;g/ml. The mouse antibodies M412 and M413 had ED<sub>50</sub>s of 1.85 &#x3bc;g/ml and 0.05 &#x3bc;g/ml, respectively, for those cells.</p>

<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Human TR-2 Expression in Tumor Cell Lines</heading>
<p id="p-0266" num="0409">Human tumor cell lines were screened for expression of TR-2. Cell lines used included those from breast, central nervous system, colon, liver, lung, cervix, uterine, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and renal cancers, as well as leukemia and melanoma.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0410">The expression of TR-2 on human tumor cells was determined using a cell-based array. Briefly, 4&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells in 100 MI CBA buffer (PBS, 3 % FBS, 0.02 % Azide) were distributed into each of the wells of 20 V-bottom 96-well plates. CBA buffer (150 &#x3bc;L) was added to each well and the plates were centrifuged to spin down the cells. The medium was discarded and 100 &#x3bc;L of antibody solution (one of the antibodies A to Q) at 10 &#x3bc;g/ml was added to the cell pellet resuspended in PBS containing 2 % PBS (&#x201c;assay buffer&#x201d;). After a 25 minute incubation on ice, the cells were washed once in assay buffer. 100 &#x3bc;L of a secondary goat anti-human IgG Fc-specific horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Pierce) was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated on ice for 20 minutes. The plates were washed twice with assay buffer, and 100 &#x3bc;L of the TMB substrate (ZYMED) was added for 10 minutes at room temperature. The plates were centrifuged and 50 &#x3bc;L of each supernate was transferred into a clean plate containing 50 &#x3bc;L stop solution (BioFX Laboratories). Optical density readings were performed at 450 nm using the SpectraMax/plus reader (Molecular Devices). The data were normalized by subtracting the optical density values obtained from an isotype control antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0411">Several cell lines had an OD<sub>450 </sub>greater than 0.1 in the assay, including breast cancer cell lines HS 578.T (OD of 0.122) and T-47 D (OD of 0.112), colon cancer cell lines TE 671 (u) (OD of 0.109), HT-29 (OD of 0.193), SW-948 (OD of 0.122), KM-12 (OD of 0.354), and HCC-2998 (OD of 0.133), liver cancer cell lines NCI-N87 (OD of 0.154) and NCI-SNU-5 (OD of 0.137), leukemia cell lines HL-60 (OD of 0.233) and hPBMC (OD of 0.131), non-small-cell lung cancer cell line JY (OD of 0.118), CCRF-CEM (OD of 0.106), NCI-H2126 (OD of 0.108) and NCI-H460 (OD of 0.122), melanoma cell lines SK-mel-5 (OD of 0.131), LOX IMVI (OD of 0.102), RPMI 7951 (OD of 0.101), and UACC-62 (OD of 0.127), pancreas cancer cell lines HPAF II (OD of 0.117) and CAPAN-1 (OD of 0.101), prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (OD of 0.174), and renal carcinoma cell lines Caki-1 (OD of 0.148) and UO-31 (OD of 0.104). The greatest expression of TR-2 among the tumor cell lines studied was found in colon cancer cell lines KM-12 and HT-29, and in leukemia cell line HL-60. None of the central nervous system, small-cell liver, cervical, uterine, or ovarian cancer cell lines studied had an OD450 greater than background.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0412">To determine TR-2 expression profile on human tumor cell lines, the above human tumor cell lines were assayed with the mouse anti-TR-2 antibody M412. The expression of TR-2 on human tumor cells was determined using a cell-based array.

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Antibody Cross-Reactivity</heading>
<p id="p-0271" num="0414">The ability of certain of the human anti-TR-2 antibodies to block the binding of the others to TR-2 was assessed, as described in Jia et al., J. Immunol. Methods 288: 91-98 (2004). The beads were conjugated with anti-human IgG antibodies using the coupling procedure taken directly from the Luminex 100 User's Manual, Version 1.7. After the beads were activated, they were coupled to a Pharmingen mouse anti-hIgG mAb, following the manufacturer's instructions. Two experiments were performed. In a first experiment, the coated beads were incubated for two hours at room temperature. In a second experiment, the coated beads were incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. At the end of the incubation, the coated beads were blocked and then counted using a Coulter cell counter. Conjugated beads were either used immediately or were stored at 4&#xb0; C. in the dark for future use.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0415">The categorization of the anti-TR-2 antibodies based on epitope cross-reactivity was performed by the following steps. First, each set of bead-mouse anti-hIgG complexes from above were separately incubated with a reference antibody (&#x201c;reference antibody&#x201d;) on a rotator overnight at 4&#xb0; C. The reference antibody was selected from anti-TR-2 antibodies A-Q, described above. After antibody capture, 2000 of each bead-mouse anti-hIgG-reference Ab complexes were pooled together in one tube, and then immediately added to each well of a 96-well plate and aspirated. TR-2 (50 ng) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing the wells, 100-500 ng/mL of another of the human anti-TR-2 antibodies (the &#x201c;probe antibody&#x201d;) was added to each well and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing the wells, bound probe antibody was detected using 1 &#x3bc;g/ml of a biotinylated version of the same monoclonal mouse anti-hIgG used for capturing the reference antibody. Following incubation and washing of the wells, 0.5 &#x3bc;g/ml streptavidin-phycoerythrin was added. The mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and then the phycoerythrin signal was detected using the Luminex 100. An additional set of wells lacking antigen was used as a negative control to aid in data analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0416">The data was analyzed in a two-step process. First, the data was normalized using the negative control values. Second, the anti-TR-2 antibodies were clustered according to their ability to impede binding of one or more other anti-TR-2 antibodies. For the clustering analysis, a dissimilarity matrix was generated from the normalized intensity matrix. Antibodies were clustered based on the values in the average dissimilarity matrix using the SPLUS 2000 agglomerative nesting hierarchical clustering subroutine with the Manhattan metric, using an input dissimilarity matrix of the actual average dissimilarity matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0417">Based on the findings, the antibodies were placed into four different epitope groups. Within any one group, the binding of one of the group members to TR-2 blocks the binding of another member of the same group to TR-2. However, the binding of one of the members of group 1 to TR-2, for example, does not block the binding of one of the members of groups 2, 3, or 4 to TR-2. Those groups are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0275" num="0418">To identify the specific region of TR-2 important for binding to certain described anti-TR-2 antibodies, an epitope mapping study was performed. An N-avidin-TR-2 construct was made by PCR-amplifying the coding sequence for mature TR-2 (MacFarlane, 1997) from a template source and cloning it into a pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) containing the chicken avidin sequence in an orientation such that upon insertion at a HindIII site, the TR-2 sequence was joined at the C-terminus of the avidin sequence. The forward primer for the mature TR-2 coding sequence was GTAAGCAAGCTTGGCTCTGATCACCCAACAAGA (SEQ ID NO: 145), and the reverse primer was GATTAGGGATCCAGAGGCAGGAGTCCCTGG (SEQ ID NO: 146).

Polynucleotides encoding human TR-2 truncations were prepared by PCR amplification using the primers described below.

To prepare for transfection, approximately 3&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>293 T cells were inoculated into each of a series of clean T75 flasks containing 15 ml growth medium, and all of the flasks were grown overnight for approximately 20 hours. Each of the pCEP4 -Avidin(N)-TR-2 constructs were transfected into different cells as follows. 15 &#x3bc;g DNA was mixed with 75 &#x3bc;L Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in the presence of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) to form a DNA-Lipofectamine complex. The complex was incubated for 20 minutes. During that incubation period, the growth medium was aspirated from the T75 flasks and replaced with 15 mL Opti-MEM. Following incubation, each transfection complex was inoculated into a different flask and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 4 to 5 hours. At the end of the incubation period, the Opti-MEM medium in each flask was replaced with fresh growth medium. Approximately 48 hours post-transfection, the conditioned media was harvested and transferred to 50 ml tubes (Falcon). The tubes were centrifuged at 2000 &#xd7;g for 10 minutes at 4&#xb0; C. to remove cells and debris, and subsequently transferred to a clean 50 mL tube.

The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 45 minutes with the reaction tubes covered by foil. Following incubation, the beads were collected again by centrifugation and washing with BPBS, and resuspended for analysis in 0.5 ml BPBS.

Observed binding of the antibodies (as measured in fluorescent intensity) to truncation TR-2-2 was 6561-6693, to truncations TR-2-3 and TR-2-5 was 3158-3866, to truncation TR-2-6 was 1959-2202, and to truncation TR-2-1 was 662-759. Binding of the antibodies to full-length TR-2 from cynomolgus monkey (as measured in fluorescent intensity) was 666-764. The antibodies did not bind to mouse or rat TR-2, or to truncations TR-2-4, TR-2-7, TR-2-9, TR-2-10, TR-2-11, TR-2-12, or TR-2-13, as determined by the fact that the binding was similar to the background for the experiment.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0447">TR-2-1 is a C-terminal truncation of TR-2 after amino acid 43, and TR-2-2, -3, -5, and -6 all include at least amino acids 16 to 85. Binding occurred when the entire region from amino acids 1 to 85 was present (see results for TR-2-2). The addition of amino acids 86 to 126 decreased binding by approximately two-fold (compare results for TR-2-2 to TR-2-3). The absence of amino acids 1 to 15 from the N-terminus of TR-2 in TR-2-2 decreased binding by approximately two-fold (compare results for TR-2-2 to TR-2-5). The simultaneous absence of amino acids 1 to 15 and the addition of amino acids 86 to 126 decreased binding by approximately three-fold (compare results for TR-2-2 to TR-2-6). Elimination of residues 44 to 85 (TR-2-1) reduced binding to about 11 % of that observed to TR-2-2. Those results indicate that one or more residues in the regions of amino acids 1 to 15 (SEQ ID NO: 94; ALITQQDLAPQQRAA) and 44 to 85 (SEQ ID NO: 95; CKYGQDYSTHWNDLL FCLRCTRCDSGEVE LSPCTTTRNTVCQ) are important for binding of those two human anti-TR-2 antibodies and human TR-2.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0448">The binding of a human anti-TR-2 antibody to each of the cyno TR-2 truncations, to human/cyno chimeras, and to human TR-2 comprising certain mouse TR-2 domains was also assessed. The anti-TR-2 antibody bound strongly to full-length human TR-2 (fluorescent intensity (&#x201c;FI&#x201d;) of 5681). The binding of the anti-TR-2 antibody to the full-length long version of cyno TR-2 was about five-fold reduced (FI of 1573) from that to full-length human TR-2. Only background levels of binding were observed to the full-length short version of cyno TR-2 (FI of 209) and to cyno TR-2 truncations 17-154 (FI of 51), cyno 1-85 (FI of 11), and cyno 17-85 (FI of 8).</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0449">The binding of certain human anti-TR-2 antibodies to cyno/human TR-2 chimeras was also assessed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>). Observed binding (FI) of the antibodies to the four chimeras was as follows: cyno/human chimera #1; FI of 5977; cyno/human chimera #2; FI of 47; cyno/human chimera #3; FI of 12; cyno/human chimera #4; FI of 1507. As above, observed binding of the antibodies to full-length human TR-2 was 5681, while binding of the antibodies to full-length cyno TR-2 was 1573 (long form) and 209 (short form).</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0450">Because the antibody binding to cyno/human chimera #1 was similar to that to the truncation TR-2-5, replacement of amino acids 1-16 with the corresponding cyno sequence apparently did not affect antibody binding in the context of human amino acids 17-85. However, replacement of amino acids 1-16 with the corresponding cyno sequence in the context of the full-length human TR-2 (cyno/human #2) significantly abrogated binding, confirming that at least one amino acid in the region from 1-16 forms part of the epitope. Binding to cyno/human chimeras #3, and #4 was significantly attenuated from that to full-length human TR-2, suggesting that amino acids 17-85 of the human sequence are important for binding. Overall, one or more of the amino acids in the region of 1-85 of the human sequence (SEQ ID NO: 96; ALITQQDLAPQQRAAPQQ KRSSPSEGLCPPGHHISEDGRDCISCKYGQDYSTHWNDLLFCLRCTRCDSG EVELSPCTTTRNTVCQ) are involved in epitope binding. Similarly, replacement of various human sequences in the region of amino acids 1-85 with the corresponding mouse sequence significantly attenuates antibody binding (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>), further confirming that one or more amino acids in that region are involved in epitope binding.</p>
