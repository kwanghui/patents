<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The use of candy in garments and other items which might be worn by an individual is known. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,872,119 which shows a bikini and other garments incorporating hard candy string elements similar to hard candy necklaces. Such items are of interest for their attractive design, novelty appeal, and function as a flavorful food experience and nutritive supplement. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> The inventive garment comprises a plurality of substantially flexible skeletal members disposed in the form of a portion of a garment fabric panel. A plurality of connecting members secure the skeletal members in a configuration corresponding to the shape of the portion of the fabric panel. A plurality of candy members is disposed on the skeletal members. </p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> The inventive garment may also further comprise a coating disposed over the candy members whereby the action of moisture is limited. Likewise a candy members may comprise an anti-stick filler material. The candy members may also comprise a compacted material. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> So yet additional advantages are achieved with candy members which comprise a compacted xylitol.</p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a garment <b>10</b>, in the illustrated example a bikini bottom or panty, comprises a plurality of the skeletal members which may be elastic, such as skeletal member <b>12</b> which support candy members such as candies <b>14</b>. Skeletal members are joined connection points such as connection point <b>16</b> by, for example, knotting or the use of an adhesive. At other points, such as point <b>18</b>, attachment may be achieved by twisting, as well as by knotting or the use of an adhesive. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> If desired, knots in the skeletal members may be placed between individual candies <b>14</b> at all points between candies <b>14</b> or at only some points in order to provide for limited removal of hard candies. </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> The various skeletal members are of different lengths and thus accommodate the mounting of different numbers of candies <b>14</b>. For example, skeletal member <b>20</b> supports five candies <b>22</b>. Skeletal member <b>24</b> supports three candies <b>26</b>. Accordingly, different numbers of candies may be released for consumption as food by breaking different skeletal members, leaving the remaining structure intact. In the case of knotted structures, any number of candies may be released. </p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"> In accordance with the invention, it is contemplated that the garment will be worn in a conventional fashion by a user <b>28</b>, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates garment <b>10</b> as it would appear when placed, for example, on the top of a table. </p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> In accordance with the invention, it is contemplated that numerous confections may be used to provide the candies <b>22</b>. While old-fashioned hard candies comprising sugar mixed with flavoring and heated to the point where polymerization is so complete that the resulting product is rigid when cooled (in other words has become a hard candy), as opposed to a crystalline or a short chain polymer form such as caramel, other forms of candy are preferred. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> More particularly, because the candies may be exposed to humidity released by the skin, in the case of a garment worn over another garment, or may be directly in contact with the skin, conventional sugar candies will tend to melt and become sticky. Accordingly, known techniques for manufacture of humidity resistant confectionery products, such as coating with sorbitol and/or other non-sugar sweeteners in or more layers, use of an adhesive or binder, or anti-stick filler materials (for example calcium carbonate) may be employed in accordance with the invention. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, candies comprising compacted crystalline sugar, flavoring, binders (such as gum Arabic), gelatin, and corn syrup, such as those sold under the trademark Altoids are preferred to a conventional hard candy. Generally, long chain sugars such as those contained in certain grades of corn syrup, gelatin and similar materials will act to insulate the sugar in the candy from the action of moisture. Likewise, compacted crystalline sugars do not promote the absorption of moisture. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> Nevertheless, other recipes known in the art of candymaking may provide superior results. For example, recipes for multilayered coated tablets comprising sugar, maltodextrin, tartaric acid, gum Arabic, rice starch, magnesium stearate, carnauba wax are even more impervious to degradation and stickiness as a result of exposure to moisture. Such recipes are used, for example, in candies marketed under the mark Tic Tac, which has a crystalline sugar core with a coating designed to inhibit degradation of the tablet on account of the action of moisture. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> Still yet more effective are xylitol based recipes. Typically, such a product would comprise the xylitol, flavoring, magnesium stearate, silica dioxide and bee's wax, and, similarly would comprise a crystalline core with a coating. Xylitol based confectionery products employed in the garment of the present invention have the additional advantages of xylitol in preventing tooth decay. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> The candies may also be made of a composition comprising dextrose, corn syrup, maltodextrin, magnesium stearate, citric acid, flavors, and colors. Such a recipe is desirably made of compacted granulated powdery materials and may include a coating. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> The above advantages of moisture protection are enhanced by the structure of the inventive garments which have plentiful void spaces to promote evaporation of surface accumulations of moisture on the candies. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a garment <b>210</b>, in this case a bikini top, constructed in accordance with the present invention is illustrated being worn by a user <b>228</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the structure is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> except for the nature of the garment defined by the skeletal members <b>212</b> and the candies <b>214</b> which they support. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, garment <b>210</b> defines a pair of neck ends <b>230</b> which are placed behind the neck and tied as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In similar fashion a pair of back strap ends <b>232</b> are placed over the back and tied as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a garment <b>310</b>, in this case a g-string, constructed in accordance with the present invention is illustrated being worn by a user <b>328</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the structure is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> except for the nature of the garment defined by the skeletal members and the candies <b>314</b> which they support. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, garment <b>310</b> defines support straps <b>360</b> supporting snaps <b>362</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> The inventive garments have been illustrated in a variety of configurations. It will be appreciated that other garments in other configurations may be employed in accordance with the invention. Likewise, other variations, such as the addition of cross-linking skeletal members may optionally be added, such as cross-linking skeletal member <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> While illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described, it is, of course, understood that various modifications will be apparent in view of the above disclosure to those of ordinary skill in the yard. Such modifications are within the spirit and scope of the invention which is limited and defined only by the appended claims. </p>
