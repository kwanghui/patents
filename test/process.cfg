## NOTE: this is a truncated version of the main 'process.cfg' file used by parse.py and start.py in the
##       above directory. The following section(s) are needed for unittests
# This section specifies which grant_handler is to be used for each year of the
# parser. This section should only have to be touched when a new parser is
# introduced. In the case where a year cannot be parsed from the filename (the
# format `ipgYYMMDD` is assumed), then the default parser is used.
